However, it never became a replica of the British system and differs in the following respects:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. India has a republican system in place of British monarchical system. In other words, the Head of the State in India (that is, President) is elected, while the Head of the State in Britain (that is, King or Queen) enjoys a hereditary position.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part297.htm#bookmark672" class="s85" name="bookmark663">2. The British system is based on the doctrine of the sovereignty of Parliament, while the Parliament is not supreme in India and enjoys limited and restricted powers due to a written Constitution, federal system, judicial review and fundamental rights</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">7 </span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part297.htm#bookmark673" class="s85" name="bookmark664">3. In Britain, the prime minister should be a member of the Lower House (House of Commons) of the Parliament. In India, the prime minister may be a member of any of the two Houses of Parliament.</a><a href="part297.htm#bookmark673" class="s14">8</a></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Usually, the members of Parliament alone are appointed as ministers in Britain. In India, a person who is not a member of Parliament can also be appointed as minister, but for a maximum period of six months.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. Britain has the system of legal responsibility of the minister while India has no such system. Unlike in Britain, the ministers in India are not required to countersign the official acts of the Head of the State.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. &#39;Shadow cabinetâ€™ is an unique institution of the British cabinet system. It is formed by the opposition party to balance the ruling cabinet and to prepare its members for future ministerial office. There is no such institution in India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part297.htm">NOTES AND REFERENCES</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part295.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part297.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
