Political Accomplishments</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. Indiaâ€™s democratic base has stabilized as a working federal polity. With the 73<span class="s21">rd </span>and 74<span class="s21">th </span>Constitutional amendments, the base of democratic debate has widened. There is greater push towards noncentralisation.
