For instance, a bill that contains a borrowing clause, but does not exclusively deal with borrowing. In two respects, a financial bill (I) is similar to a money bill-(a) both of them can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in the Rajya Sabha, and</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(b) both of them can be introduced only on the recommendation of the president. In all other respects, a financial bill (I) is governed by the same legislative procedure applicable to an ordinary bill. Hence, it can be either rejected or amended by the Rajya Sabha (except that an amendment other than for reduction or abolition of a tax cannot be moved in either House without the recommendation of the president i.e., the recommendation of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">president is not required for moving an amendment making provision for the reduction or aboli-sition of a tax). In case of a disagreement between the two Houses over such a bill, the president can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses to resolve the deadlock. When the bill is presented to the President, he can either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part543.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part545.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
