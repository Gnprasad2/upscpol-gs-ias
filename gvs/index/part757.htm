They are determined by the chief minister according to the exigencies of the time and requirements of the situation.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Like at the Centre, in the states too, the council of ministers consists of three categories of ministers, namely, cabinet ministers, ministers of state, and deputy ministers. The difference between them lies in their respective ranks, emoluments, and political importance. At the top of all these ministers stands the chief minister-supreme governing authority in the state.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part760.htm#bookmark1534" class="s85" name="bookmark1528">The cabinet ministers head the important departments of the state government like home, education, finance, agriculture and so forth</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">3</span>. They are members of the cabinet, attend its meetings and play an important role in deciding policies. Thus, their responsibilities extend over the entire gamut of state government.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The ministers of state can either be given independent charge of departments or can be attached to cabinet ministers. However, they are not members of the cabinet and do not attend the cabinet meetings unless specially invited when something related to their departments are considered by the cabinet.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Next in rank are the deputy ministers. They are not given independent charge of departments. They are attached to the cabinet ministers and assist them in their administrative, political and parliamentary duties. They are not members of the cabinet and do not attend cabinet meetings.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">At times, the council of ministers may also include a deputy chief minister. The deputy chief ministers are appointed mostly for local political reasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part756.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part758.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
