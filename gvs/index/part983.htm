Later, it was transferred to the Ministry of Personnel and now it enjoys the status of an attached office</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">1</span>. The Special Police Establishment (which looked into vigilance cases) setup in 1941 was also merged with the CBI.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The establishment of the CBI was recommended by the Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption (1962-1964). The CBI is not a statutory body. It derives its powers from the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The CBI is the main investigating agency of the Central Government. It plays an important role in the prevention of corruption and maintaining integrity in administration. It also provides assistance to the Central Vigilance Commission and Lokpal.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">There is a difference between the nature of cases investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the CBI. The NIA has been constituted after the Mumbai terror attack in 2008 mainly for investigation of incidents of terrorist attacks, funding of terrorism and other terror related crime, whereas the CBI investigates crime of corruption, economic offences and serious and organized crime other than terrorism.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part982.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part984.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
