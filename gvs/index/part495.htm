Any of them can preside over the House in the absence of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker. He has the same powers as the Speaker when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of chairpersons is nominated. When a member of the panel of chairpersons is also not present, any other person as determined by House acts as the Speaker.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">It must be emphasised here that a member of the panel of chairpersons cannot preside over the House, when the office of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker is vacant. During such time, the Speakerâ€™s duties are to be performed by such member of the House as the President may appoint for the purpose. The elections are held, as soon as possible, to fill the vacant posts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Speaker <i>Pro Tem</i></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As provided by the Constitution, the Speaker of the last Lok Sabha vacates his office immediately before the first meeting of the newly-elected Lok Sabha.
