The other parties are simply declared as <i>registered-unrecognised </i>parties.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The recognition granted by the Commission to the parties determines their right to certain privileges like allocation of the party symbols, provision of time for political broadcasts on the state-owned television and radio stations and access to electoral rolls.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Further, the recognized parties need only one proposer for filing the nomination. Also, these parties are allowed to have forty &quot;star campaigners” during the time of elections and the registered- unrecognized parties are allowed to have twenty &quot;star campaigners”. The travel expenses of these star campaigners are not included in the election expenditure of the candidates of their parties.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Every national party is allotted a symbol exclusively reserved for its use throughout the country. Similarly, every state party is allotted a symbol exclusively reserved for its use in the state or states in which it is so recognised. A registered-unrecognised party, on the other hand, can select a symbol from a list of free symbols. In other words, the Commission specifies certain symbols as &#39;reserved symbols’ which are meant for the candidates set up by the recognised parties and others as &#39;free symbols’ which are meant for other candidates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1079.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1081.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
