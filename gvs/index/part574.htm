Financial Powers and Functions</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No tax can be levied or collected and no expenditure can be incurred by the Executive except under the authority and with the approval of Parliament. Hence, the budget is placed before the Parliament for its approval. The enactment of the budget by the Parliament legalises the receipts and expenditure of the government for the ensuing financial year.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Parliament also scrutinises government spending and financial performance with the help of its financial committees. These include public accounts committee, estimates committee and committee on public undertakings. They bring out the cases of illegal, irregular, unauthorised, improper usage and wastage and extravagance in public expenditure.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Therefore, the parliamentary control over the Executive in financial matters operates in two stages:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(a) budgetary control, that is, control before the appropriation of grants through the enactment of the budget; and</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) post-budgetary control, that is, control after the appropriation of grants through the three financial committees.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The budget is based on the principle of annuity, that is, the Parliament grants money to the government for one financial year. If the granted money is not spent by the end of the financial year, then the balance expires and returns to the Consolidated Fund of India. This practice is known as the &#39;rule of lapse’. It facilitates effective financial control by the Parliament as no reserve funds can be built without its authorisation. However, the observance of this rule leads to heavy rush of expenditure towards the close of the financial year. This is popularly called as &#39;March Rush’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part573.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part575.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
