It distinguished between the commercial and political functions of the Company.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. It allowed the Court of Directors to manage the commercial affairs, but created a new body called Board of Control to manage the political affairs. Thus, it established a system of double government.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. It empowered the Board of Control to supervise and direct all operations of the civil and military government or revenues of the British possessions in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, the act was significant for two reasons: first, the Company’s territories in India were for the first time called the &#39;British possessions in India’; and second, the British Government was given the supreme control over Company’s affairs and its administration in India.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part75.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part77.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
