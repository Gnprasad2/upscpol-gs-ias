An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the introduction of a bill for the purpose in either House of Parliament and not in the state legislatures.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. The bill can be introduced either by a minister or by a private member and does not require prior permission of the president.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. The bill must be passed in each House by a special majority, that is, a majority of the total membership of the House and a majority of two-thirds of the members of the House present and voting.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Each House must pass the bill separately. In case of a disagreement between the two Houses, there is no provision for holding a joint sitting of the two Houses for the purpose of deliberation and passage of the bill.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. If the bill seeks to amend the federal provisions of the Constitution, it must also be ratified by the legislatures of half of the states by a simple majority, that is, a majority of the members of the House present and voting.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. After duly passed by both the Houses of Parliament and ratified by the state legislatures, where necessary, the bill is presented to the president for assent.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part262.htm#bookmark549" class="s85" name="bookmark538">7. The president must give his assent to the bill. He can neither withhold his assent to the bill nor return the bill for reconsideration of the Parliament.</a><a href="part262.htm#bookmark549" class="s14">2</a></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">8. After the presidentâ€™s assent, the bill becomes an Act (i.e., a constitutional amendment act) and the Constitution stands amended in accordance with the terms of the Act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part255.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part257.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
