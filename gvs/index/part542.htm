It states that a bill is deemed to be a money bill if it contains &#39;onlyâ€™ provisions dealing with all or any of the following matters:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. The imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax;</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. The regulation of the borrowing of money by the Union government;</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. The custody of the Consolidated Fund of India or the contingency fund of India, the payment of moneys into or the withdrawal of money from any such fund;</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. The appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund of India;</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. Declaration of any expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India or increasing the amount of any such expenditure;</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. The receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of India or the public account of India or the custody or issue of such money, or the audit of the accounts of the Union or of a state; or</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">7. Any matter incidental to any of the matters specified above.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">However, a bill is not to be deemed to be a money bill by reason only that it provides for:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. the demand or payment of fees for licenses or fees for services rendered; or</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">If any question arises whether a bill is a money bill or not, the decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is final. His decision in this regard cannot be questioned in any court of law or in the either House of Parliament or even the president. When a money bill is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for recommendation and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">presented to the president for assent, the Speaker endorses it as a money bill.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution lays down a special procedure for the passing of money bills in the Parliament. A money bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha and that too on the recommendation of the president. Every such bill is considered to be a government bill and can be introduced only by a minister.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">After a money bill is passed by the Lok Sabha, it is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for its consideration. The Rajya Sabha has restricted powers with regard to a money bill. It cannot reject or amend a money bill. It can only make the recommendations. It must return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, whether with or without recommendations. The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject all or any of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">If the Lok Sabha accepts any recommendation, the bill is then deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the modified form. If the Lok Sabha does not accept any recommendation, the bill is then deemed to have passed by both the Houses in the form originally passed by the Lok Sabha without any change.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">If the Rajya Sabha does not return the bill to the Lok Sabha within 14 days, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form originally passed by the Lok Sabha. Thus, the Lok Sabha has more powers than Rajya Sabha with regard to a money bill. On the other hand, both the Houses have equal powers with regard to an ordinary bill.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Finally, when a money bill is presented to the president, he may either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill but cannot return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses. Normally, the president gives his assent to a money bill as it is introduced in the Parliament with his prior permission.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Table 22.4 shows the differences between the procedures for the enactment of ordinary bills and money bills.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part541.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part543.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
