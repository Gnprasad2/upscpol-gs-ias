With regard to other privileges, it provided that they were to be the same as those of the British House of Commons, its committees and its members on the date of its commencement (ie, 26 January, 1950), until defined by Parliament. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 provided that the other privileges of each House of Parliament, its committees and its members are to be those which they had on the date of its commencement (ie, 20 June, 1979), until defined by Parliament. This means that the position with regard to other privileges remains same. In other words, the amendment has made only verbal changes by dropping a direct reference to the British House</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1210" class="s85" name="bookmark1171">of Commons, without making any change in the implication of the provision.</a><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1210" class="s14">31</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">It should be noted here that the Parliament, till now, has not made any special law to exhaustively codify all the privileges. They are based on five sources, namely,</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Constitutional provisions,</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Various laws made by Parliament,</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Rules of both the Houses,</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. Parliamentary conventions, and</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5. Judicial interpretations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part588.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part590.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
