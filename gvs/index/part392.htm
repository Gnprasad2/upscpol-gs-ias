The bill then ends and does not become an act. Usually, this veto is exercised in the following two cases:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">(a) With respect to private members’ bills (ie, bills introduced by any member of Parliament who is not a minister); and</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">(b) With respect to the government bills when the cabinet resigns (after the passage of the bills but before the assent by the President) and the new cabinet advises the President not to give his assent to such bills.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">In 1954, President Dr. Rajendra Prasad withheld his assent to the PEPSU Appropriation Bill. The bill was passed by the Parliament when the President’s Rule was in operation in the state of PEPSU. But, when the bill was presented to the President for his assent, the President’s Rule was revoked.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Again in 1991, President R Venkataraman withheld his assent to the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament (Amendment) Bill. The bill was passed by the Parliament (on the last day before dissolution of Lok Sabha) without obtaining the previous recommendation of the President.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part391.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part393.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
