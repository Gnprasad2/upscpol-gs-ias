The total strength of the Constituent Assembly was to be</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part119.htm#bookmark162" class="s85" name="bookmark129">389. Of these, 296 seats were to be allotted to British India and 93 seats to the princely states. Out of 296 seats allotted to the British India, 292 members were to be drawn from the eleven governors’ provinces</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">2</span> <a href="part119.htm#bookmark163" class="s85">and four from the four Chief Commissioners’ provinces</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">3 </span><span class="p">, one from each.</span><a name="bookmark130">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. Each province and princely state (or group of states in case of small states) were to be allotted seats in proportion to their respective population. Roughly, one seat was to be allotted for every million population.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. Seats allocated to each British province were to be divided among the three principal communities-Muslims, Sikhs and General (all except Muslims and Sikhs), in proportion to their population.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. The representatives of each community were to be elected by members of that community in the provincial legislative assembly and voting was to be by the method of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. The representatives of the princely states were to be nominated by the heads of the princely states.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: right;"><a href="part119.htm#bookmark164" class="s85" name="bookmark131">It is, thus, clear that the Constituent Assembly was to be a partly elected and partly nominated body. Moreover, the members were to be indirectly elected by the members of the provincial assemblies, who themselves were elected on a limited franchise</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">4 </span>. The elections to the Constituent Assembly (for 296 seats allotted to the British Indian Provinces) were held in July-August 1946. The Indian National Congress won 208 seats, the Muslim League 73 seats and the small groups and independents got the remaining 15 seats. However, the 93 seats allotted to the princely states were not filled as they decided to stay away from the</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Constituent Assembly.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Although the Constituent Assembly was not directly elected by the people of India on the basis of adult franchise, the Assembly comprised representatives of all sections of the Indian society- Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis, Anglo-Indians, Indian Christians, SCs, STs including women of all these sections. The Assembly included all important personalities of India at that time, with the exception of Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part103.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part105.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
