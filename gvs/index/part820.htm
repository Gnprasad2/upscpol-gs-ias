Control over Subordinate Courts</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to its appellate jurisdiction and supervisory jurisdiction over the subordinate courts as mentioned above, a high court has an administrative control and other powers over them. These include the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(a) It is consulted by the governor in the matters of appointment, posting and promotion of district judges and in the appointments of persons to the judicial service of the state (other than district judges).</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) It deals with the matters of posting, promotion, grant of leave, transfers and discipline of the members of the judicial service of the state (other than district judges).</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(c) It can withdraw a case pending in a subordinate court if it involves a substantial question of law that require the interpretation of the Constitution. It can then either dispose of the case itself or determine the question of law and return the case to the subordinate court with its judgement.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(d) Its law is binding on all subordinate courts functioning within its territorial jurisdiction in the same sense as the law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all courts in India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part819.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part821.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
