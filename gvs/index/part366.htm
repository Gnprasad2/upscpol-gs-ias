However, if the proclamation of President’s Rule is issued at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place during the period of two months without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha approves it in the mean time.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part377.htm#bookmark847" class="s85" name="bookmark817">If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the President’s Rule continues for six months</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">6</span><a href="part377.htm#bookmark848" class="s85">.

However, if the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place during the period of six months without approving the further continuation of the President’s Rule, then the proclamation survives until 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha has in the meantime approved its continuance.</span><a name="bookmark818">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Every resolution approving the proclamation of President’s Rule or its continuation can be passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple majority, that is, a majority of the members of that House present and voting.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 introduced a new provision to put restraint on the power of Parliament to extend a proclamation of President’s Rule beyond one year. Thus, it provided that, beyond one year, the President’s Rule can be extended by six months at a time only when the following two conditions are fulfilled:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. a proclamation of National Emergency should be in operation in the whole of India, or in the whole or any part of the state; and</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. the Election Commission must certify that the general elections to the legislative assembly of the concerned state cannot be held on account of difficulties.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">A proclamation of President’s Rule may be revoked by the President at any time by a subsequent proclamation. Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part365.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part367.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
