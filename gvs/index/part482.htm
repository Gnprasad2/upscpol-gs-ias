In default of such intimation, his seat in the Rajya Sabha becomes vacant.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) If a sitting member of one House is also elected to the other House, his seat in the first House becomes vacant.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(c) If a person is elected to two seats in a House, he should exercise his option for one. Otherwise, both seats become vacant.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1188" class="s85" name="bookmark1134">Similarly, a person cannot be a member of both the Parliament and the state legislature at the same time.
