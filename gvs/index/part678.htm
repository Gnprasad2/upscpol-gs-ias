He can do so only with the previous consent of the president and also of the person to be so appointed. Such a judge is entitled to such allowances as the president may determine. He will also enjoy all the jurisdiction, powers and privileges of a judge of Supreme Court. But, he will not otherwise be deemed to be a judge of the Supreme Court.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part677.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part679.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
