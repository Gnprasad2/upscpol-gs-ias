He is provided with the security of tenure. He can be removed by the president only in accordance with the procedure mentioned in the Constitution. Thus, he does not hold his office till the pleasure of the president, though he is appointed by him.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. He is not eligible for further office, either under the Government of India or of any state, after he ceases to hold his office.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part933.htm#bookmark2126" class="s85" name="bookmark2115">3. His salary and other service conditions are determined by the Parliament. His salary is equal to that of a judge of the Supreme Court</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">3 </span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Neither his salary nor his rights in respect of leave of absence, pension or age of retirement can be altered to his disadvantage after his appointment.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. The conditions of service of persons serving in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department and the administrative powers of the CAG are prescribed by the president after consultation with the CAG.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. The administrative expenses of the office of the CAG, including all salaries, allowances and pensions of persons serving in that office are charged upon the Consolidated Fund of India. Thus, they are not subject to the vote of Parliament.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Further, no minister can represent the CAG in Parliament (both Houses) and no minister can be called upon to take any responsibility for any actions done by him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part927.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part929.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
