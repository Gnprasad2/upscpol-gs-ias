Constitutional Conflict</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">K Santhanam has pointed out that the Directives lead to a constitutional conflict (a) between the Centre and the states, (b) between the President and the Prime Minister, and (c) between the governor and the chief minister. According to him, the Centre can give directions to the states with regard to the implementation of these principles, and in case of non-compliance, can dismiss the state government. Similarly, when the Prime Minister gets a bill (which violates the Directive Principles) passed by the Parliament, the president may reject the bill on the ground that these principles are fundamental to the governance of the country and hence, the ministry has no right to ignore them. The same constitutional conflict may occur between the governor and the chief minister at the state level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part240.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part242.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
