They are extra-constitutional in emergence. In other words, they are not mentioned in the Constitution. However, the Rules of Business provide for their establishment.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1108">2. They are of two types-standing and </a><i>ad hoc</i>. The former are of a permanent nature while the latter are of a temporary nature. The <i>ad hoc </i><a href="part460.htm#bookmark1116" class="s85">committees are constituted from time to time to deal with special problems. They are disbanded after their task is completed.</a><a href="part460.htm#bookmark1116" class="s14">1</a></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. They are set up by the Prime Minister according to the exigencies of the time and requirements of the situation. Hence, their number, nomenclature, and composition varies from time to time.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Their membership varies from three to eight. They usually include only Cabinet Ministers. However, the non-cabinet Ministers are not debarred from their membership.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. They not only include the Ministers in charge of subjects covered by them but also include other senior Ministers.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. They are mostly headed by the Prime Minister. Some times other Cabinet Ministers, particularly the Home Minister or the Finance Minister, also acts as their Chairman. But, in case the Prime Minister is a member of a committee, he invariably presides over it.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">7. They not only sort out issues and formulate proposals for the consideration of the Cabinet, but also take decisions. However, the Cabinet can review their decisions.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">8. They are an organisational device to reduce the enormous workload of the Cabinet. They also facilitate in-depth examination of policy issues and effective coordination. They</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are based on the principles of division of labour and effective delegation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part455.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part457.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
