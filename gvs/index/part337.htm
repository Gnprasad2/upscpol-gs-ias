There are two types of grants-in-aid, viz, statutory grants and discretionary grants:</p><p class="s51" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Statutory Grants</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Article 275 empowers the Parliament to make grants to the states which are in need of financial assistance and not to every state. Also, different sums may be fixed for different states. These sums are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India every year.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Apart from this general provision, the Constitution also provides for specific grants for promoting the welfare of the scheduled tribes in a state or for raising the level of administration of the scheduled areas in a state including the State of Assam.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The statutory grants under Article 275 (both general and specific) are given to the states on the recommendation of the Finance Commission.</p><p class="s51" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Discretionary Grants</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Article 282 empowers both the Centre and the states to make any grants for any public purpose, even if it is not within their respective legislative competence. Under this provision, the Centre makes grants to the states.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">&quot;These grants are also known as discretionary grants, the reason being that the Centre is under no obligation to give these grants and the matter lies within its discretion. These grants have a two-fold purpose: to help the state financially to fulfil plan targets; and to give</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part350.htm#bookmark773" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;" name="bookmark742">some leverage to the Centre to influence and coordinate state action to effectuate the national plan.‚Äù</a><a href="part350.htm#bookmark773" class="s47">21</a></p><p class="s51" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Other Grants</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The Constitution also provided for a third type of grants-in-aid, but for a temporary period. Thus, a provision was made for grants in lieu of export duties on jute and jute products to the States of Assam, Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal. These grants were to be given for a period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution. These sums were charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and were made to the states on the recommendation of the Finance Commission.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part336.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part338.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
