The Commission observed that the constitution of a large number of GoMs has resulted in many GoMs not being able to meet regularly to complete their work thus leading to significant delays on many major issues.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. The Commission felt that more selective use of the institution of GoMs would perhaps lead to more effective coordination particularly if they are empowered to arrive at a decision on behalf of the Cabinet with time limits that are prescribed for completing the work entrusted to them.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. The Commission recommended that there is need to ensure that the existing coordination mechanism of GoMs function effectively and helps in early resolution of issues. Selective, but effective use of GoMs with clear mandate and prescribed time limits would be helpful.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part460.htm">NOTES AND REFERENCES</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part458.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part460.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
