They are charged on the Consolidated Fund of the State and thus are not subject to the annual vote of the state legislature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part770.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part772.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
