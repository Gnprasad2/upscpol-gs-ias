Thus, the executive power of the Centre extends to the whole of India: (i) to the matters on which the Parliament has exclusive power of legislation (i.e., the subjects enumerated in the Union List); and (ii) to the exercise of rights, authority and jurisdiction conferred on it by any treaty or agreement. Similarly, the executive power of a state extends to its territory in respect of matters on which the state legislature has exclusive power of legislation (i.e., the subjects enumerated in the State List).</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In respect of matters on which both the Parliament and the state</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part350.htm#bookmark757" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;" name="bookmark723">legislatures have power of legislation (i.e., the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List), the executive power rests with the states except when a Constitutional provision or a parliamentary law specifically confers it on the Centre. Therefore, a law on a concurrent subject, though enacted by the Parliament, is to be executed by the states except when the Constitution or the Parliament has directed otherwise.</a><a href="part350.htm#bookmark757" class="s47">5</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part322.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part324.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
