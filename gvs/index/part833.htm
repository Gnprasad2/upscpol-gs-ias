This initiative proved very successful in the settlement of disputes. Consequently, the institution of Lok Adalat started spreading to other parts of the country. At that time, this</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">institution was functioning as a voluntary and conciliatory agency without any statutory backing for its decisions. In view of its growing popularity, there arose a demand for providing a statutory backing to this institution and the awards given by Lok Adalats. Hence, the institution of Lok Adalat has been given statutory status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The Act makes the following provisions relating to the organisation and functioning of the Lok Adalats:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">1. The State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Authority or the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee or the High Court Legal Services Committee or the Taluk Legal Services Committee may organise Lok Adalats at such intervals and places and for exercising such jurisdiction and for such areas as it thinks fit.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">2. Every Lok Adalat organised for an area shall consist of such number of serving or retired judicial officers and other persons of the area as may be specified by the agency organizing such Lok Adalat. Generally, a Lok Adalat consists of a judicial officer as the chairman and a lawyer (advocate) and a social worker as members.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">3. A Lok Adalat shall have jurisdiction to determine and to arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties to a dispute in respect of:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">(i) any case pending before any court; or</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">(ii) any matter which is falling within the jurisdiction of any court an not brought before such court.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Thus, the Lok Adalat can deal with not only the cases pending before a court but also with the disputes at pre-litigation stage.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: right;">The various matters such as Matri-monial/Family Disputes, Criminal (Compoundable Offences) cases, Land Acquisition cases, Labour disputes, Workmenâ€™s compensation cases, Bank Recovery cases, Pension cases, Housing Board and Slum Clearance cases, Housing Finance cases, Consumer Grievance cases, Electricity matters, Disputes relating to Telephone Bills, Municipal matters including House Tax cases, Disputes with Cellular Companies etc. are being taken up in the Lok Adalats.<span class="s56">7a </span>But, the Lok Adalat shall have no jurisdiction in respect of any case or matter relating to an offence not compoundable under any law. In other words, the offences which are non-</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">compoundable under any law fall outside the purview of the Lok Adalat.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">4. Any case pending before the court can be referred to the Lok Adalat for settlement if:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">(i) the parties thereof agree to settle the dispute in the Lok Adalat</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">(ii) one of the parties thereof makes an application to the court referring the case to the Lok Adalat; or</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">(iii) the court is satisfied that the matter is an appropriate one to taken cognizance of by the Lok Adalat.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">In the case of a pre-litigation dispute, the matter can be referred to the Lok Adalat for settlement by the agency organizing the Lok Adalat, on receipt of an application from any one of the parties to the dispute.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">5. The Lok Adalat shall have the same powers as are vested in a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure (1908), while trying a suit in respect of the following matters:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">(a) the summoning and enforcing the attendance of any witness examining him on oath;</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">(b) the discovery and production of any document;</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c) the reception of evidence on affidavits;</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">(d) the requisitioning of any public record or document from any court or office; and</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">(e) such other matters as may be prescribed.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Further, a Lok Adalat shall have the requisite powers to specify its own procedure for the determination of any dispute coming before it. Also, all proceedings before a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of the Indian Penal Code (1860) and every Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for the purpose of the Code of Criminal Procedure (1973).</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">6. An award of a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a Civil Court or an order of any other court. Every award made by a Lok Adalat shall be final and binding on all the parties to the dispute. No appeal shall lie to any court against the award of the Lok Adalat.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part832.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part834.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
