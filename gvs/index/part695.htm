Writ Jurisdiction</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution has constituted the Supreme Court as the guarantor and defender of the fundamental rights of the citizens. The Supreme Court is empowered to issue writs including <i>habeas corpus</i>, <i>mandamus</i>, prohibition, <i>quo warranto </i>and <i>certiorari </i>for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of an aggrieved citizen. In this regard, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in the sense that an aggrieved citizen can directly go to the Supreme Court, not necessarily by way of appeal. However, the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is not exclusive. The high courts</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are also empowered to issue writs for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights. It means, when the Fundamental Rights of a citizen are violated, the aggrieved party has the option of moving either the high court or the Supreme Court directly.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Therefore, the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court with regard to federal disputes is different from its original jurisdiction with regard to disputes relating to fundamental rights. In the first case, it is exclusive and in the second case, it is concurrent with high courts jurisdiction. Moreover, the parties involved in the first case are units of the federation (Centre and states) while the dispute in the second case is between a citizen and the Government (Central or state).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">There is also a difference between the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that of the high court. The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and not for other purposes. The high court, on the other hand, can issue writs not only for the enforcement of the fundamental rights but also for other purposes. It means that the writ jurisdiction of the high court is wider than that of the Supreme Court. But, the Parliament can confer on the Supreme Court, the power to issue writs for other purposes also.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part694.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part696.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
