It has all the powers of a civil court and its proceedings have a judicial character. It may call for information or report from the state government or any other authority subordinate thereto.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Commission is not empowered to inquire into any matter after the expiry of one year from the date on which the act constituting violation of human rights is alleged to have been committed. In other words, it can look into a matter within one year of its occurrence.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Commission may take any of the following steps during or upon the completion of an inquiry:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(a) it may recommend to the state government or authority to make payment of compensation or damages to the victim;</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) it may recommend to the state government or authority the initiation of proceedings for prosecution or any other action against the guilty public servant;</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(c) it may recommend to the state government or authority for the grant of immediate interim relief to the victim;</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(d) it may approach the Supreme Court or the state high court for the necessary directions, orders or writs.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">From the above, it is clear that the functions of the commission are mainly recommendatory in nature. It has no power to punish the violators of human rights, nor to award any relief including monetary relief to the victim. Notably, its recommendations are not binding on the state government or authority. But, it should be informed about the action taken on its recommendations within one month.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part960.htm#bookmark2324" class="s85" name="bookmark2317">The Commission submits its annual or special reports to the state government. These reports are laid before the state legislature, along with a memorandum of action taken on the recommendations of the Commission and the reasons for non- acceptance of any of such recommendations</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">4 </span>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part956.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part958.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
