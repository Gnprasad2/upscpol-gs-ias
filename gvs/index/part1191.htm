A merger takes place when two- thirds of the members of the party have agreed to such merger.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) If a member, after being elected as the presiding officer of the House, voluntarily gives up the membership of his party or rejoins it after he ceases to hold that office. This exemption has been provided in view of the dignity and impartiality of this office.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">It must be noted here that the provision of the Tenth Schedule pertaining to exemption from disqualification in case of split by one-third members of legislature party has been deleted by the 91<span class="s21">st </span>Amendment Act of 2003. It means that the defectors have no more protection on grounds of splits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1190.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1192.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
