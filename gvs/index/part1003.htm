It is the central counter-terrorism law enforcement agency in the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The NIA was established in the backdrop of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, popularly known as the 26/11 incident. This national horror led to the realisation of the need for a separate federal agency to deal with terror-related crimes in the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The headquarters of the NIA is at New Delhi. The branch offices of the NIA are located at Hyderabad, Guwahati, Mumbai, Lucknow, Kochi, Kolkata, Jammu and Raipur. In addition, the NIA has a separate specialised cell known as TFFC Cell dealing with the subjects of fake currency notes and terror funding.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The NIA is headed by a Director-General. He is appointed by the central government. His powers are similar to the powers exercisable by a Director-General of Police in respect of the police force in a state.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The NIA works under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The state government extends all assistance and co-operation to the NIA for investigation of the offences specified under the NIA Act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1002.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1004.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
