They hold different positions (general, functional and technical) in the departments of the state government. However, they occupy lower positions (in the administrative hierarchy of the state) than those held by the members of the all-India services (IAS, IPS and IFS).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">The number of services in a state differ from state to state. The services that are common to all the states are:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Civil Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Police Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Forest Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. Agricultural Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5. Medical Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6. Veterinary Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7. Fisheries Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8. Judicial Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9. Public Health Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10. Educational Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11. Co-operative Service.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12. Registration Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13. Sales Tax Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14. Jail Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15. Service of Engineers.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Each of these services is named after the state, that is, name of the state is added as a prefix. For example, in Andhra Pradesh (AP), they are known as AP Civil Service, AP Police Service, AP Forest Service, AP Agricultural Service, AP Medical Service, AP Veterinary Service, AP Fisheries Service, AP Judicial Service, and so on. Among all the state services, the civil service (also known as the administrative service) is the most prestigious.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Like the Central services, the state services are also classified into four categories: class I (group I or group A), class II (group II or group B), class III (group III or group C) and class IV (group IV or group D).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Further, the state services are also classified into gazetted class and non-gazetted class. Usually, Class I (Group-A) and Class-II (Group-B) Services are gazetted classes while Class-III (Group-C) and Class-IV (Group-D) services are non-gazetted classes. The names of the members of gazetted class are published in the Government Gazette for appointment, transfer, promotion and retirement, while those of the non-gazetted are not published. Further, the members of the gazetted class enjoy some privileges which are denied to the members of non-gazetted class. Also, the members of the gazetted class are called &#39;officers’ while those of non-gazetted are called &#39;employees’.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The All-India Services Act of 1951 specifies that senior posts not exceeding thirty-three and one third per cent in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFS) are required to be filled in by promotion of officers employed in the state services. Such promotions are made on the recommendation of selection committee constituted for this purpose in each state. Such a committee is presided over by the Chairman or a member of UPSC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1040.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1042.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
