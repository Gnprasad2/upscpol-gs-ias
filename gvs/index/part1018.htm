A DDMA consists of a chairperson and other members, not exceeding seven. The Collector (or District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner) of the district is the ex-officio chairperson of the DDMA. The elected representative of the local authority is the ex- officio co-chairperson of the DDMA. But, in case of Tribal Areas (as referred to in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India), the chief executive member of the district council of autonomous district is the ex-officio co-chairperson of the DDMA. The chief executive officer of the DDMA, the superintendent of police and the chief medical officer of the district are the ex-officio members of the DDMA. Not more than two other district level officers are appointed by the state government as the members of the DDMA. In case of a district where Zilla Parishad exists, the chairperson of that Zilla Parishad is the co-chairperson of the DDMA. The chief executive officer of the DDMA is appointed by the state government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1017.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1019.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
