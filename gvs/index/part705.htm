Other Powers</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Besides the above, the Supreme Court has numerous other powers:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(a) It decides the disputes regarding the election of the president and the vicepresident. In this regard, it has the original, exclusive and final authority.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) It enquires into the conduct and behaviour of the chairman and members of the Union Public Service Commission on a reference made by the president. If it finds them guilty of misbehaviour, it can recommend to the president for their removal. The advice tendered by the Supreme Court in this regard is binding on the President.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(c) It has power to review its own judgement or order. Thus, it is not bound by its previous decision and can depart from it in the interest of justice or community welfare. In brief, the Supreme Court is a self-correcting agency. For example, in the <i>Kesavananda Bharati </i>case (1973), the Supreme Court departed from its previous judgement in the <i>Golak Nath </i>case (1967).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(d) It is authorised to withdraw the cases pending before the high courts and dispose them by itself. It can also transfer a case or appeal pending before one high court to another high court.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(e) Its law is binding on all courts in India. Its decree or order is enforceable throughout the country. All authorities (civil and judicial) in the country should act in aid of the Supreme Court.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(f) It has power of judicial superintendence and control over all the courts and tribunals functioning in the entire territory of the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Supreme Courtâ€™s jurisdiction and powers with respect to matters in the Union list can be enlarged by the Parliament. Further, its jurisdiction and powers with respect to other matters can be enlarged by a special agreement of the Centre and the states.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part704.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part706.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
