Roy, a pioneer of communist movement in India. In 1935, the Indian National Congress (INC), for the first time, officially demanded a Constituent Assembly to frame the Constitution of India. In 1938, Jawaharlal Nehru, on behalf the INC declared that &#39;the Constitution of free India must be framed, without outside interference, by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult franchise’.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part119.htm#bookmark161" class="s85" name="bookmark127">The demand was finally accepted in principle by the British Government in what is known as the &#39;August Offer’ of 1940. In 1942, Sir Stafford Cripps, a Member of the Cabinet, came to India with a draft proposal of the British Government on the framing of an independent Constitution to be adopted after the World War II. The Cripps Proposals were rejected by the Muslim League, which wanted India to be divided into two autonomous states with two separate Constituent Assemblies. Finally, a Cabinet Mission</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">1</span> <span class="p">was sent to India. While it rejected the idea of two Constituent Assemblies, it put forth a scheme for the Constituent Assembly which more or less satisfied the Muslim League.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part101.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part103.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
