Information Dissemination</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">Information dissemination in relation to elections, particularly during the process of elections is extremely important for all stakeholders. Starting from the announcement of elections to nomination, scrutiny, campaign, security arrangements, polling, counting, declaration of results, etc., all of these require widest circulation. The voter comes to know about the basics like: what, when, where and how of elections generally through the media. Even last minute changes of polling arrangements, violation of Model Code of Conduct (MCC), and violation of expenditure instructions, any untoward incidents or disturbances promptly come to the notice not only of the people but also of the Election Commission through the media.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: justify;">Newspapers and news channels have very enthusiastically made use of the information relating to educational, financial and criminal antecedents of candidates, contained in the affidavit filed by them along with their nomination paper, which is immediately uploaded on the Election Commissionâ€™s website. This has contributed to further honesty and transparency in the election system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1175.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1177.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
