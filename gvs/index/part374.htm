However, if the proclamation of Financial Emergency is issued at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place during the period of two months without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha has in the meantime approved it.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Once approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Financial Emergency continues indefinitely till it is revoked. This implies two things:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. there is no maximum period prescribed for its operation; and</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. repeated parliamentary approval is not required for its continuation.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">A resolution approving the proclamation of financial emergency can be passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple majority, that is, a majority of the members of that house present and voting.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">A proclamation of Financial Emergency may be revoked by the president at anytime by a subsequent proclamation. Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part373.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part375.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
