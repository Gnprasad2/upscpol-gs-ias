It can authorise the Parliament to make a law on a subject enumerated in the State List (Article 249).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. It can authorise the Parliament to create new All-India Services common to both the Centre and states (Article 312).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. It alone can initiate a move for the removal of the vice- president. In other words, a resolution for the removal of the vice-president can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha and not in the Lok Sabha (Article 67).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. If a proclamation is issued by the President for imposing national emergency or presidentâ€™s rule or financial emergency at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place within the period allowed for its approval, then the proclamation can remain effective even if it is approved by the Rajya Sabha alone (Articles 352, 356 and 360).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">An analysis of the above points makes it clear that the position of the Rajya Sabha in our constitutional system is not as weak as that of the House of Lords in the British constitutional system nor as strong as that of the Senate in the American constitutional system. Except in financial matters and control over the council of ministers, the powers and status of the Rajya Sabha in all other spheres are broadly equal and coordinate with that of the Lok Sabha.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Even though the Rajya Sabha has been given less powers as compared with the Lok Sabha, its utility is supported on the following grounds:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. It checks hasty, defective, careless and ill-considered legislation made by the Lok Sabha by making provision of revision and thought.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. It facilitates giving representation to eminent professionals and experts who cannot face the direct election. The President nominates 12 such persons to the Rajya Sabha.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. It maintains the federal equilibrium by protecting the interests of the states against the undue interference of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Centre.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part582.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part584.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
