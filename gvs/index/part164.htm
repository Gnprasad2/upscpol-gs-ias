It was urged that the Preamble cannot be amended as it is not a part of the Constitution. The petitioner contended that the amending power in Article 368 cannot be used to destroy or damage the basic elements or the fundamental features of the Constitution, which are enshrined in the Preamble.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark275">The Supreme Court, however, held that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution. The Court stated that the opinion tendered by it in the </a><i>Berubari Union </i><a href="part165.htm#bookmark296" class="s85">(1960) in this regard was wrong, and held that the Preamble can be amended, subject to the condition that no amendment is done to the &#39;basic featuresâ€™. In other words, the Court held that the basic elements or the fundamental features of the Constitution as contained in the Preamble cannot be altered by an amendment under Article 368</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">20 </span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Preamble has been amended only once so far, in 1976, by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, which has added three new words-Socialist, Secular and Integrity-to the Preamble. This amendment was held to be valid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part165.htm">NOTES AND REFERENCES</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part163.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part165.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
