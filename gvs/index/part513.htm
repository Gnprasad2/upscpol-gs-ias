During this time, the members ask questions and the ministers usually give answers. The questions are of three kinds, namely, starred, unstarred and short notice.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">A <b>starred question </b>(distinguished by an asterisk) requires an oral answer and hence supplementary questions can follow.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">An <b>unstarred question</b>, on the other hand, requires a written answer and hence, supplementary questions cannot follow.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">A <b>short notice question </b>is one that is asked by giving a notice of less than ten days. It is answered orally.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the ministers, the questions can also be asked to the private members. Thus, a question may be addressed to a private member if the subject matter of the question relates to some Bill, resolution or other matter connected with the business of the House for which that member is responsible. The procedure in regard to such question is the same as that followed in the case of questions addressed to a minister.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The list of starred, unstarred, short notice questions and questions to private members are printed in green, white, light pink and yellow colour, respectively, to distinguish them from one another.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part512.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part514.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
