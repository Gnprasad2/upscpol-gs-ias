The features of the American presidential system of government are as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(a) The American President is both the head of the State and the head of government. As the head of State, he occupies a ceremonial position. As the head of government, he leads the executive organ of government.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) The President is elected by an electoral college for a fixed tenure of four years. He cannot be removed by the Congress except by impeachment for a grave unconstitutional act.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(c) The President governs with the help of a cabinet or a smaller body called &#39;Kitchen Cabinetâ€™. It is only an advisory body and consists of non-elected departmental secretaries. They are selected and appointed by him, are responsible only to him, and can be removed by him any time.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(d) The President and his secretaries are not responsible to the Congress for their acts. They neither possess membership in the Congress nor attend its sessions.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(e) The President cannot dissolve the House of Representatives-the lower house of the Congress.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(f) The doctrine of separation of powers is the basis of the American presidential system. The legislative, executive and judicial powers of the government are separated and vested in the three independent organs of the government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part277.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part279.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
