They are appointed by the president by warrant under his hand and seal on the recommendation of a three- member committee consisting of the prime minister as its head, the Union minister of home affairs and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. They hold office for a term of four years or until they attain the age of sixty five years, whichever is earlier. After their tenure, they are not eligible for further employment under the Central or a state government.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The president can remove the Central Vigilance Commissioner or any vigilance commissioner from the office under the following circumstances:</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) If he is adjudged an insolvent; or</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: left;">(b) If he has been convicted of an offence which (in the opinion of the Central government) involves a moral turpitude; or</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: left;">(c) If he engages, during his term of office, in any paid employment outside the duties of his office; or</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: left;">(d) If he is (in the opinion of the president), unfit to continue in office by reason of infirmity of mind or body; or</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: left;">(e) If he has acquired such financial or other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially his official functions.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to these, the president can also remove the Central Vigilance Commissioner or any vigilance commissioner on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. However, in these cases, the president has to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an enquiry. If the Supreme Court, after the enquiry, upholds the cause of removal and advises so, then the president can remove him. He is deemed to be guilty of misbehaviour, if he (a) is concerned or interested in any contract or agreement made by the Central government, or (b) participates in any way in the profit of such contract or agreement or in any benefit or emolument arising therefrom otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The salary, allowances and other conditions of service of the Central Vigilance Commissioner are similar to those of the Chairman of UPSC and that of the vigilance commissioner are similar to those of a member of UPSC. But they cannot be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part973.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part975.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
