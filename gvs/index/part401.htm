However, he can resign from his office at any time by addressing the resignation letter to the President. He can also be removed from the office before completion of his term. A formal impeachment is not required for his removal. He can be removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then members of the Rajya Sabha and agreed to by the Lok Sabha. This means that this resolution should be passed in the Rajya Sabha by an effective majority and in the Lok Sabha by a simple majority. It must be noted here that the effective majority in India is only a type of special majority and not a separate one. Further, this resolution can be introduced only in the Rajya Sabha and not in the Lok Sabha. But, no such resolution can be moved unless at least 14 daysâ€™ advance notice has been given. Notably, no ground has been mentioned in the Constitution for his removal.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part405.htm#bookmark1055" class="s85" name="bookmark1041">The Vice-President can hold office beyond his term of five years until his successor assumes charge. He is also eligible for reelection to that office. He may be elected for any number of terms.</a><a href="part405.htm#bookmark1055" class="s14">5</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part400.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part402.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
