He is elected after the election of the Speaker has taken place.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker remains in office usually during the life of the assembly. However, he also vacates his office earlier in any of the following three cases:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">1. if he ceases to be a member of the assembly;</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. if he resigns by writing to the speaker; and</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">3. if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then members of the assembly. Such a resolution can be moved only after giving 14 days’ advance notice.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker’s office when it is vacant. He also acts as the Speaker when the latter is absent from the sitting of assembly. In both the cases, he has all the powers of the Speaker.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The Speaker nominates from amongst the members a panel of chairman. Any one of them can preside over the assembly in the absence of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker. He has the same powers as the speaker when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of chairman is nominated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part769.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part771.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
