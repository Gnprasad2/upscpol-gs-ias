This is because, the American Constitution provides for &#39;due process of law’ against that of &#39;procedure established by law’ which is contained in the Indian Constitution. The difference between the two is: &quot;The due process of law gives wide scope to the Supreme Court to grant protection to the rights of its citizens. It can declare laws violative of these rights void not only on substantive grounds of being unlawful, but also on procedural grounds of being unreasonable. Our Supreme Court, while determining the constitutionality of a law, however examines only the substantive question i.e., whether the law is within the powers of the authority concerned or not. It is not expected to go into the question of its reasonableness, suitability or policy implications”.</a><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1349" class="s14">10</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The exercise of wide power of judicial review by the American Supreme Court in the name of &#39;due process of law’ clause has made the critics to describe it as a &#39;third chamber’ of the Legislature, a super-legislature, the arbiter of social policy and so on. This American principle of judicial supremacy is also recognised in our constitutional system, but to a limited extent. Nor do we fully follow the British Principle of parliamentary supremacy. There are many limitations on the sovereignty of Parliament in our country, like the written character of the Constitution, the federalism with division of powers, the Fundamental Rights and the judicial review. In effect, what exists in India is a synthesis of both, that is, the American principle of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">judicial supremacy and the British principle of parliamentary supremacy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part714.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part716.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
