Now, under the 95th Amendment Act of 2009, this reservation is to last until 2020.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Though seats are reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, they are elected by all the voters in a constituency, without any separate electorate. A member of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes is also not debarred from contesting a general (non-reserved) seat.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The 84th Amendment Act of 2001 provided for refixing of the reserved seats on the basis of the population figures of 1991 census as applied to rationalisation of the general seats. Later, the 87th Amendment Act of 2003 provided for the refixing of the reserved seats on the basis of 2001 census and not 1991 census.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part473.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part475.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
