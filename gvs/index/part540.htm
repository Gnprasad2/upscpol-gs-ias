Bill in the Second House</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the second House also, the bill passes through all the three stages, that is, first reading, second reading and third reading. There are four alternatives before this House:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: left;">(a) it may pass the bill as sent by the first house (ie, without amendments);</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: left;">(b) it may pass the bill with amendments and return it to the first House for reconsideration;</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c) it may reject the bill altogether; and</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(d) it may not take any action and thus keep the bill pending.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">If the second House passes the bill without any amendments or the first House accepts the amendments suggested by the second House, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses and the same is sent to the president for his assent. On the other hand, if the first House rejects the amendments suggested by the second House or the second House rejects the bill altogether or the second House does not take any action for six months, a deadlock is deemed to have taken place. To resolve such a deadlock, the president can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses. If the majority of members present and voting in the joint sitting approves the bill, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part539.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part541.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
