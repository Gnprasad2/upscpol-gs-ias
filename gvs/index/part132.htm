Fundamental Duties</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The original constitution did not provide for the Fundamental Duties of the citizens. These were added during the operation of internal emergency (1975-77) by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976 on the recommendation of the Swaran Singh Committee. The 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002 added one more fundamental duty.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Part IV-A of the Constitution (which consists of only one Article 51-A) specifies the eleven Fundamental Duties viz., to respect the Constitution, national flag and national anthem; to protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of the country; to promote the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people; to preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture and so on.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The fundamental duties serve as a reminder to citizens that while enjoying their rights, they have also to be quite conscious of duties they owe to their country, their society and to their fellow- citizens. However, like the Directive Principles, the duties are also non-justiciable in nature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part131.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part133.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
