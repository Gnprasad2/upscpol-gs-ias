No separate order for their suspension is required.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, the state is freed from the restrictions imposed by Article 19. In other words, the state can make any law or can take any executive action abridging or taking away the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. Any such law or executive action cannot be challenged on the ground that they are inconsistent with the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. When the National Emergency ceases to operate, Article 19 automatically revives and comes into force. Any law made during Emergency, to the extent of inconsistency with Article 19, ceases to have effect. However, no remedy lies for anything done during the Emergency even after the Emergency expires. This means that the legislative and executive actions taken during the emergency cannot be challenged even after the Emergency ceases to operate.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 358 in two ways. Firstly, the six Fundamental Rights under Article</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">19 can be suspended only when the National Emergency is declared on the ground of war or external aggression and not on the ground of armed rebellion. Secondly, only those laws which are related with the Emergency are protected from being challenged and not other laws. Also, the executive action taken only under such a law is protected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part360.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part362.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
