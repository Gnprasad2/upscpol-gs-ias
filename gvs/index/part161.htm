Fraternity</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fraternity means a sense of brotherhood. The Constitution promotes this feeling of fraternity by the system of single citizenship. Also, the Fundamental Duties (Article 51-A) say that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic, regional or sectional diversities.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Preamble declares that fraternity has to assure two things- the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation. The word &#39;integrity’ has been added to the preamble by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment (1976).</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">According to K.M. Munshi, a member of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly, the phrase &#39;dignity of the individual’ signifies that the Constitution not only ensures material betterment and maintain a democratic set-up, but that it also recognises that the personality of every individual is sacred. This is highlighted through some of the provisions of the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, which ensure the dignity of individuals. Further, the Fundamental Duties (Article 51-A) also protect the dignity of women by stating that it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women, and also makes it the duty of every citizen of India to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The phrase &#39;unity and integrity of the nation’ embraces both the psychological and territorial dimensions of national integration. Article 1 of the Constitution describes India as a &#39;Union of States’ to make it clear that the states have no right to secede from the Union, implying the indestructible nature of the Indian Union. It aims at overcoming hindrances to national integration like communalism, regionalism, casteism, linguism, secessionism and so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part160.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part162.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
