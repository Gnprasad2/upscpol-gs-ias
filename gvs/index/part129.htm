Integrated and Independent Judiciary</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Indian Constitution establishes a judicial system that is integrated as well as independent.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Supreme Court stands at the top of the integrated judicial system in the country. Below it, there are high courts at the state level. Under a high court, there is a hierarchy of subordinate courts, that is, district courts and other lower courts. This single system of courts enforces both the central laws as well as the state laws, unlike in USA, where the federal laws are enforced by the federal judiciary and the state laws are enforced by the state judiciary.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Supreme Court is a federal court, the highest court of appeal, the guarantor of the fundamental rights of the citizens and the guardian of the Constitution. Hence, the Constitution has made various provisions to ensure its independence-security of tenure of the judges, fixed service conditions for the judges, all the expenses of the Supreme Court charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, prohibition on discussion on the conduct of judges in the legislatures, ban on practice after retirement, power to punish for its contempt vested in the Supreme Court, separation of the judiciary from the executive, and so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part128.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part130.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
