There is an accommodation of diverse interests in the functioning of the government. A coalition government acts as a channel to meet the expectations and redress the grievances of different groups.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. India is a highly diversified country. There are different cultures, languages, castes, religions and ethnic groups, and all these get represented in the coalition governments. This means that a coalition government is more representative in nature and it better reflects the popular opinion of the electorate. In other words, it represents a much more broader spectrum of public opinion than the single-party government.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. A coalition government comprises different political parties having their own ideologies or agendas. But, the governmental policy requires the concurrence of all the coalition partners. Therefore, a coalition government leads to consensus-based politics. In other words, there is consensual decision-making in the coalition governments.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Coalition politics strengthens the federal fabric of the Indian political system. This is because a coalition government is more sensitive and responsive to the regional demands and concerns than the single-party government.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. A coalition government reduces the tyranny of government (despotic rule). This is due to the reduced domination of a single political party in the functioning of the government. All the members of the coalition participate in the political decision-making. In short, the decisions made are more balanced.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1184.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1186.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
