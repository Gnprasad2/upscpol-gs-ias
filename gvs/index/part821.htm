A Court of Record</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As a court of record, a high court has two powers:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(a) The judgements, proceedings and acts of the high courts are recorded for perpetual memory and testimony. These records are admitted to be of evidentiary value and cannot be questioned when produced before any subordinate court. They are recognised as legal precedents and legal references.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) It has power to punish for contempt of court, either with simple imprisonment or with fine or with both.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The expression &#39;contempt of courtâ€™ has not been defined by the Constitution. However, the expression has been defined by the Contempt of Court Act of 1971. Under this, contempt of court may be civil or criminal. Civil contempt means wilful disobedience to any judgement, order, writ or other process of a court or wilful</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">breach of an undertaking given to a court. Criminal contempt means the publication of any matter or doing an act which-(i) scandalises or lowers the authority of a court; or (ii) prejudices or interferes with the due course of a judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or obstructs the administration of justice in any other manner.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">However, innocent publication and distribution of some matter, fair and accurate report of judicial proceedings, fair and reasonable criticism of judicial acts and comment on the administrative side of the judiciary do not amount to contempt of court.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">As a court of record, a high court also has the power to review and correct its own judgement or order or decision, even though no specific power of review is conferred on it by the Constitution. The Supreme Court, on the other hand, has been specifically conferred with the power of review by the constitution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part820.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part822.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
