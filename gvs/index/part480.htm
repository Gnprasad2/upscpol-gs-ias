A member incurs disqualification under the defection law:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">1. if he voluntary gives up the membership of the political party on whose ticket he is elected to the House;</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">2. if he votes or abstains from voting in the House contrary to any direction given by his political party;</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">3. if any independently elected member joins any political party; and</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">4. if any nominated member joins any political party after the expiry of six months.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The question of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is decided by the Chairman in the case of Rajya Sabha and Speaker in the case of Lok Sabha (and not by the president of India). In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that the decision of the Chairman/ Speaker in this regard is subject to judicial review.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part479.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part481.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
