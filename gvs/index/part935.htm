He must be a person who is qualified to be appointed a judge of the Supreme Court. In other words, he must be a citizen of India and he must have been a judge of some high court for five years or an advocate of some high court for ten years or an eminent jurist, in the opinion of the president.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The term of office of the AG is not fixed by the Constitution. Further, the Constitution does not contain the procedure and grounds for his removal. He holds office during the pleasure of the president. This means that he may be removed by the president at any time. He may also quit his office by submitting his resignation to the president. Conventionally, he resigns when the government (council of ministers) resigns or is replaced, as he is appointed on its advice.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The remuneration of the AG is not fixed by the Constitution. He receives such remuneration as the president may determine.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part934.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part936.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
