Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Further, the President must revoke a proclamation if the Lok Sabha passes a resolution disapproving its continuation. Again, this safeguard was introduced by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978. Before the amendment, a proclamation could be revoked by the president on his own and the Lok Sabha had no control in this regard.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 also provided that, where one-tenth of the total number of members of the Lok Sabha give a written notice to the Speaker (or to the president if the House is not in session), a special sitting of the House should be held within 14 days for the purpose of considering a resolution disapproving the continuation of the proclamation.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">A resolution of disapproval is different from a resolution approving the continuation of a proclamation in the following two respects:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. The first one is required to be passed by the Lok Sabha only, while the second one needs to be passed by the both Houses of Parliament.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. The first one is to be adopted by a simple majority only, while the second one needs to be adopted by a special majority.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part355.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part357.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
