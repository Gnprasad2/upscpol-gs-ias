When a vote is cast, a slip is printed and remains exposed through a transparent window for seven seconds, showing the serial number, name and symbol of the candidate. Thereafter, the receipt automatically gets cut and falls into the sealed dropbox of the VVPAT. The system allows a voter</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1175.htm#bookmark2842" class="s85" name="bookmark2802">to challenge his/her vote on the basis of the paper receipt. As per rules, the Presiding Officer of the polling booth will have to record the dissent of the voter, which would have to be taken into account at the time of counting, if the challenge is found to be false.</a><a href="part1175.htm#bookmark2842" class="s14">31</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1175.htm#bookmark2843" class="s85" name="bookmark2803">The law for using VVPATs was amended in 2013. In 2013, the Supreme Court of India had permitted the ECI to introduce VVPAT in a phased manner, calling it &#39;an indispensable requirement of free and fair electionsâ€™. The Court had felt that introducing VVPAT would ensure the accuracy of the voting system and also help in manual counting of votes in case of dispute. VVPATs were first used in byeelection to the Noksen Assembly Constituency of Nagaland held in 2013. Thereafter, VVPATs have been used in selected constituencies during every General Election to State Legislative Assemblies. VVPATs were used in eight selected Parliamentary Constituencies in the country in the 2014 Lok Sabha Election. EVMs with VVPAT ensure the accuracy and transparency of the voting system.</a><a href="part1175.htm#bookmark2843" class="s14">32</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1165.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1167.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
