The discussion on a resolution is strictly relevant to and within the scope of the resolution. A member who has moved a resolution or amendment to a resolution cannot withdraw the same except by leave of the House.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1195" class="s85" name="bookmark1147">Resolutions are classified into three categories:</a><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1195" class="s14">16</a></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. <i>Private Member’s Resolution: </i>It is one that is moved by a private member (other than a minister). It is discussed only on alternate Fridays and in the afternoon sitting.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. <i>Government Resolution: </i>It is one that is moved by a minister. It can be taken up any day from Monday to Thursday.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. <i>Statutory Resolution: </i>It can be moved either by a private member or a minister. It is so called because it is always tabled in pursuance of a provision in the Constitution or an Act of Parliament.</p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1196" class="s85" name="bookmark1148">Resolutions are different from motions in the following respects: &quot;All resolutions come in the category of substantive motions, that is to say, every resolution is a particular type of motion. All motions need not necessarily be substantive. Further, all motions are not necessarily put to vote of the House, whereas all the resolutions are required to be voted upon.”</a><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1196" class="s14">17</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part529.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part531.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
