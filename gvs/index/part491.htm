Whenever the office of the Speaker falls vacant, the Lok Sabha elects another member to fill the vacancy. The date of election of the Speaker is fixed by the President.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Usually, the Speaker remains in office during the life of the Lok Sabha. However, he has to vacate his office earlier in any of the following three cases:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. if he ceases to be a member of the Lok Sabha;</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. if he resigns by writing to the Deputy Speaker; and</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all then members of the Lok Sabha. Such a resolution can be moved only after giving 14 daysâ€™ advance notice.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">When a resolution for the removal of the Speaker is under consideration of the House, he cannot preside at the sitting of the House, though he may be present. However, he can speak and take part in the proceedings of the House at such a time and vote in the first instance, though not in the case of an equality of votes.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">It should be noted here that, whenever the Lok Sabha is dissolved, the Speaker does not vacate his office and continues till the newly-elected Lok Sabha meets.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part490.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part492.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
