Broadly speaking, his relationship with the public corporations falls into the following three categories:</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;">(i) Some corporations are audited totally and directly by the CAG, for example, Damodar Valley Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Air India, Indian Airlines Corporation, and others.</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) Some other corporations are audited by private professional auditors who are appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the CAG. If necessary, the CAG can conduct supplementary audit. The examples are, Central Warehousing Corporation, Industrial Finance Corporation, and others.</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) Some other corporations are totally subjected to private audit. In other words, their audit is done exclusively by private professional auditors and the CAG does not come into the picture at all. They submit their annual reports and accounts directly to the Parliament. Examples of such corporations are Life Insurance Corporation of India, Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India, Food Corporation of India, and others.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The role of the CAG in the auditing of Government companies is also limited. They are audited by private auditors who are appointed by the Government on the advise of the CAG. The CAG can also undertake supplementary audit or test audit of such companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In 1968, an Audit Board was established as a part of the office of CAG to associate outside specialists and experts to handle the technical aspects of audit of specialised enterprises like engineering, iron and steel, chemicals and so on. This board was established on the recommendations of the Administrative Reforms Commission of India. It consists of a Chairman and two members appointed by the CAG.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part930.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part932.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
