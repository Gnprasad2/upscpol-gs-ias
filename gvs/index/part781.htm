Such a bill can be introduced either by a minister or by any other member. The bill passes through three stages in the originating House, viz,</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">1. First reading,</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Second reading, and</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Third reading.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">After the bill is passed by the originating House, it is transmitted to the second House for consideration and passage. A bill is deemed to have been passed by the state legislature only when both the Houses have agreed to it, either with or without amendments. In case of a unicameral legislature, a bill passed by the legislative assembly is sent directly to the governor for his assent.</p><p class="s51" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bill in the Second House</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">In the second House also, the bill passes through all the three stages, that is, first reading, second reading and third reading.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">When a bill is passed by the legislative assembly and transmitted to the legislative council, the latter has four alternatives before it:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">1. it may pass the bill as sent by the assembly (i.e., without amendments);</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">2. it may pass the bill with amendments and return it to the assembly for reconsideration;</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">3. it may reject the bill altogether; and</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. it may not take any action and thus keep the bill pending.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">If the council passes the bill without amendments or the assembly accepts the amendments suggested by the council, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses and the same is sent to the the governor for his assent. On the other hand, if the assembly rejects the amendments suggested by the council or the council rejects the bill altogether or the council does not take any action for three months, then the assembly may pass the bill again and transmit the same to the council. If the council rejects the bill again or passes the bill with amendments not acceptable to the assembly or does not pass the bill</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">within one month, then the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form in which it was passed by the assembly for the second time.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Therefore, the ultimate power of passing an ordinary bill is vested in the assembly. At the most, the council can detain or delay the bill for a period of four months-three months in the first instance and one month in the second instance. The Constitution does not provide for the mechanism of joint sitting of both the Houses to resolve the disagreement between the two Houses over a bill. On the other hand, there is a provision for joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to resolve a disagreement between the two over an ordinary bill. Moreover, when a bill, which has originated in the council and was sent to the assembly, is rejected by the assembly, the bill ends and becomes dead.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, the council has been given much lesser significance, position</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and authority than that of the Rajya Sabha at the Centre.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s51" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Assent of the Governor</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Every bill, after it is passed by the assembly or by both the Houses in case of a bicameral legislature, is presented to the governor for his assent. There are four alternatives before the governor:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">1. he may give his assent to the bill;</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. he may withhold his assent to the bill;</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">3. he may return the bill for reconsideration of the House or Houses; and</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: justify;">4. he may reserve the bill for the consideration of the President.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1555">If the governor gives his assent to the bill, the bill becomes an Act and is placed on the Statute Book. If the governor withholds his assent to the bill, the bill ends and does not become an Act. If the governor returns the bill for reconsideration and if the bill is passed by the House or both the Houses again, with or without amendments, and presented to the governor for his assent, the governor must give his assent to the bill. Thus, the governor enjoys only a </a><i>suspensive veto</i><a href="part786.htm#bookmark1582" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;">. The position is same at the Central level also</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">13 </span>.</p><p class="s51" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Assent of the President</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">When a bill is reserved by the governor for the consideration of the President, the President may either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of the House or Houses of the state legislature. When a bill is so returned, the House or Houses have to reconsider it within a period of</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">six months. The bill is presented again to the presidential assent after it is passed by the House or Houses with or without amendments. It is not mentioned in the Constitution whether it is obligatory on the part of the president to give his assent to such a bill or not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part780.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part782.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
