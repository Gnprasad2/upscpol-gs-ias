A Court of Record</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As a Court of Record, the Supreme Court has two powers:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: left;">(a) The judgements, proceedings and acts of the Supreme Court are recorded for perpetual memory and testimony. These</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">records are admitted to be of evidentiary value and cannot be questioned when produced before any court. They are recognised as legal precedents and legal references.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) It has power to punish for contempt of court, either with simple imprisonment for a term up to six months or with fine up to â‚¹2,000 or with both. In 1991, the Supreme Court has ruled that it has power to punish for contempt not only of itself but also of high courts, subordinate courts and tribunals functioning in the entire country.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Contempt of court may be civil or criminal. Civil contempt means wilful disobedience to any judgement, order, writ or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court. Criminal contempt means the publication of any matter or doing an act which-<b>(i) </b>scandalises or lowers the authority of a court; or <b>(ii) </b>prejudices or interferes with the due course of a judicial proceeding; or <b>(iii) </b>interferes or obstructs the administration of justice in any other manner.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">However, innocent publication and distribution of some matter, fair and accurate report of judicial proceedings, fair and reasonable criticism of judicial acts and comment on the administrative side of the judiciary do not amount to contempt of court.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part701.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part703.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
