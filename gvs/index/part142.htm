Hence, they called the Constitution as a &quot;Carbon Copy of the 1935 Act” or an &quot;Amended Version of the 1935 Act”. For example, N. Srinivasan observed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that the Indian Constitution is &quot;both in language and substance a close copy of the Act of 1935”. Similarly, Sir Ivor Jennings, a British Constitutionalist, said that &quot;the Constitution derives directly from the Government of India Act of 1935 from which, in fact, many of its provisions are copied almost textually”.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Further, P.R. Deshmukh, a member of the Constituent Assembly, commented that &quot;the Constitution is essentially the Government of India Act of 1935 with only adult franchise added”.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part148.htm#bookmark236" class="s85" name="bookmark199">The same Dr. B.R. Ambedkar answered the above criticism in the Constituent Assembly in the following way : &quot;As to the accusation that the Draft Constitution has reproduced a good part of the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, I make no apologies. There is nothing to be ashamed of in borrowing. It involves no plagiarism. Nobody holds any patent rights in the fundamental ideas of a Constitution. What I am sorry about is that the provisions taken from the Government of India Act, 1935, relate mostly to the details of administration”.</a><a href="part148.htm#bookmark236" class="s14">20</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part141.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part143.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
