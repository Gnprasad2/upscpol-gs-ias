Executive Powers and Functions</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution of India established a parliamentary form of government in which the Executive is responsible to the Parliament for its policies and acts. Hence, the Parliament exercises control over the Executive through question-hour, zero hour, half-an-hour discussion, short duration discussion, calling attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion, censure motion and other discussions. It also supervises the activities of the Executive with the help of its committees like committee on government assurance, committee on subordinate legislation, committee on petitions, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general and to the Lok Sabha in particular. As a part of collective responsibility, there is individual responsibility, that is, each minister is individually responsible for the efficient administration of the ministry under his charge. This means that they continue in office so long as they enjoy the confidence of the majority members in the Lok Sabha. In other words, the council of ministers can be removed from office by the Lok Sabha by passing a noconfidence motion. The Lok Sabha can also express lack of confidence in the government in the following ways:</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: left;">(a) By not passing a motion of thanks on the President’s inaugural address.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) By rejecting a money bill.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c) By passing a censure motion or an adjournment motion.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(d) By defeating the government on a vital issue.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(e) By passing a cut motion.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1202" class="s85" name="bookmark1160">Therefore, &quot;the first function of Parliament can be said to be to select the group which is to form the government, support and sustain it in power so long as it enjoys its confidence, and to expel it when it ceases to do so, and leave it to the people to decide at the next general election.”</a><a href="part602.htm#bookmark1202" class="s14">23</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part572.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part574.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
