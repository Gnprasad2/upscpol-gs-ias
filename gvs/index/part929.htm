Accordingly, the Parliament enacted the CAG’s (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) act, 1971. This Act was amended in 1976 to separate accounts from audit in the Central government.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The duties and functions of the CAG as laid down by the Parliament and the Constitution are:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. He audits the accounts related to all expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India, consolidated fund of each state and consolidated fund of each union territory having a Legislative Assembly.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. He audits all expenditure from the Contingency Fund of India and the Public Account of India as well as the contingency fund of each state and the public account of each state.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. He audits all trading, manufacturing, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and other subsidiary accounts kept by any department of the Central Government and state governments.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4.

He audits the receipts and expenditure of the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(a) All bodies and authorities substantially financed from the Central or state revenues;</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(b) Government companies; and</p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(c) Other corporations and bodies, when so required by related laws.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. He audits all transactions of the Central and state governments related to debt, sinking funds, deposits, advances, suspense accounts and remittance business. He also audits receipts, stock accounts and others, with</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">approval of the President, or when required by the President.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">7. He audits the accounts of any other authority when requested by the President or Governor. For example, the audit of local bodies.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">8. He advises the President with regard to prescription of the form in which the accounts of the Centre and the states shall be kept (Article 150).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">9. He submits his audit reports relating to the accounts of the Centre to President, who shall, in turn, place them before both the Houses of Parliament (Article 151).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">10. He submits his audit reports relating to the accounts of a state to governor, who shall, in turn, place them before the state legislature (Article 151).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">11. He ascertains and certifies the net proceeds of any tax or duty (Article 279). His certificate is final. The &#39;net proceeds’ means the proceeds of a tax or a duty minus the cost of collection.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">12. He acts as a guide, friend and philosopher of the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">13. He compiles and maintains the accounts of state governments. In 1976, he was relieved of his responsibilities with regard to the compilation and maintenance of accounts of the Central Government due to the separation of accounts from audit, that is, departmentalisation of accounts.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The CAG submits three audit reports to the President-audit report on appropriation accounts, audit report on finance accounts, and audit report on public undertakings. The President lays these reports before both the Houses of Parliament. After this, the Public Accounts Committee examines them and reports its findings to the Parliament.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The appropriation accounts compare the actual expenditure with the expenditure sanctioned by the Parliament through the Appropriation Act, while the finance accounts show the annual receipts and disbursements of the Union government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part928.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part930.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
