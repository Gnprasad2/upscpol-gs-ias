The rationality behind the special arrangements in respect of only these four states lies in the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part884.htm#bookmark1851" class="s85" name="bookmark1842">&quot;The tribes in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram have not assimilated much the life and ways of the other people in these states. These areas have hitherto been anthropological specimens. The tribal people in other parts of India have more or less adopted the culture of the majority of the people in whose midst they live. The tribes in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram, on the other hand, still have their roots in their own culture, customs and civilization. These areas are, therefore, treated differently by the Constitution and sizeable amount of autonomy has been given to these people for self- government.</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">3 </span>‚Äù</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The various features of administration contained in the Sixth Schedule are as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part884.htm#bookmark1852" class="s85" name="bookmark1843">1. The tribal areas in the four states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram have been constituted as autonomous districts</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">4</span>. But, they do not fall outside the executive authority of the state concerned.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. The governor is empowered to organise and re-organise the autonomous districts. Thus, he can increase or decrease their areas or change their names or define their boundaries and so on.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. If there are different tribes in an autonomous district, the governor can divide the district into several autonomous regions.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Each autonomous district has a district council consisting of 30 members, of whom four are nominated by the governor and the remaining 26 are elected on the basis of adult franchise. The elected members hold office for a term of five years (unless the council is dissolved earlier) and nominated members hold office during the pleasure of the governor.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Each autonomous region also has a separate regional council.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. The district and regional councils administer the areas under their jurisdiction. They can make laws on certain specified matters like land, forests, canal water, shifting cultivation, village administration, inheritance of property, marriage and divorce, social customs and so on. But all such laws require the assent of the governor.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. The district and regional councils within their territorial jurisdictions can constitute village councils or courts for trial of suits and cases between the tribes. They hear appeals from them. The jurisdiction of high court over these suits and cases is specified by the governor.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">7. The district council can establish, construct or manage primary schools, dispensaries, markets, ferries, fisheries, roads and so on in the district. It can also make regulations for the control of money lending and trading by nontribals. But, such regulations require the assent of the governor.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">8. The district and regional councils are empowered to assess and collect land revenue and to impose certain specified taxes.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part884.htm#bookmark1853" class="s85" name="bookmark1844">9. The acts of Parliament or the state legislature do not apply to autonomous districts and autonomous regions or apply with specified modifications and exceptions</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">5 </span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">10. The governor can appoint a commission to examine and report on any matter relating to the administration of the autonomous districts or regions. He may dissolve a district or regional council on the recommendation of the commission.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1845">Table 41.1 </a><i>Tribal Areas at a Glance (2019)</i></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part883.htm">States Tribal Areas</a><a class="toc0" href="part884.htm">NOTES AND REFERENCES</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part881.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part883.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
