This power of the President not to take any action (either positive or negative) on the bill is known as the pocket veto. The President can exercise this veto power as the Constitution does not prescribe any time-limit within which he has to take the decision with respect to a bill presented to him for his assent. In USA, on the other hand, the President has to return the bill for reconsideration within 10 days.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Hence, it is remarked that the pocket of the Indian President is bigger than that of the American President.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">In 1986, President Zail Singh exercised the pocket veto with respect to the Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill. The bill, passed by the Rajiv Gandhi Government, imposed restrictions on the freedom of press and hence, was widely criticised. After three years, in 1989, the next President R Venkataraman sent the bill back for reconsideration, but the new National Front Government decided to drop the bill.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">It should be noted here that the President has no veto power in respect of a constitutional amendment bill. The 24th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1971 made it obligatory for the President to give his assent to a constitutional amendment bill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part393.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part395.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
