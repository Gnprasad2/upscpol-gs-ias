Representation of States</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The representatives of states in the Rajya Sabha are elected by the elected members of state legislative assemblies. The election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. The seats are allotted to the states in the Rajya Sabha on the basis of population. Hence, the number of representatives varies from state to state. For example, Uttar Pradesh has 31 members while Tripura has 1 member only. However, in USA, all states are given equal representation in the Senate irrespective of their population. USA has 50 states and the Senate has 100 members-2 from each state.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part463.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part465.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
