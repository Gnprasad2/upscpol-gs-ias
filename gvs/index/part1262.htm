On Centre-State and Inter-State Relations</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1.

Management of disasters and emergencies (both natural and manmade) should be included in the List III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3.

The question whether the ministry in a state has lost the confidence of the assembly or not should be tested only on the floor of the House.

Even without the state being under a proclamation of emergency, Presidentâ€™s Rule may be continued if elections cannot be held.

Parliament should replace the River Boards Act of 1956 with another comprehensive enactment after consultation with all the states.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">11. When the state bill is reserved for consideration of the President, there should be a time-limit (say of three months) within which the President should take a decision whether to give his assent or to return the bill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1261.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1263.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
