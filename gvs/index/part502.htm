The office of &#39;whipâ€™, on the other hand, is mentioned neither in the Constitution of India nor in the Rules of the House nor in a Parliamentary Statute. It is based on the conventions of the parliamentary government.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Every political party, whether ruling or Opposition has its own whip in the Parliament. He is appointed by the political party to serve as an assistant floor leader. He is charged with the responsibility of ensuring the attendance of his party members in large numbers and securing their support in favour of or against a particular issue. He regulates and monitors their behaviour in the Parliament. The members are supposed to follow the directives given by the whip. Otherwise, disciplinary action can be taken.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part501.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part503.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
