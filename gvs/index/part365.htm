It is this duty in the performance of which the Centre takes over the government of a state under Article 356 in case of failure of constitutional machinery in state. This is popularly known as &#39;President’s Rule’. It is also known as &#39;State Emergency’ or &#39;Constitutional Emergency’.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The President’s Rule can be proclaimed under Article 356 on two grounds-one mentioned in Article 356 itself and another in Article 365:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. Article 356 empowers the President to issue a proclamation, if he is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of a state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Notably, the president can act either on a report of the governor of the state or otherwise too (ie, even without the governor’s report).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. Article 365 says that whenever a state fails to comply with or to give effect to any direction from the Centre, it will be lawful for the president to hold that a situation has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part364.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part366.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
