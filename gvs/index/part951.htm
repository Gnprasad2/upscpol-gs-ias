It has no power to punish the violators of human rights, nor to award any relief including monetary relief to the victim. Notably, its recommendations are not binding on the concerned government or authority. But, it should be informed about the action taken on its recommendations within one month. In this context, a former member of the Commission observed</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">5</span> <span class="p">: &#39;The government cannot wash away the recommendations made by the Commission. The commission’s role may be recommendatory, advisory, yet the Government considers the cases forwarded by it. It is, therefore, improper to say that the commission is powerless. It enjoys great material authority and no government can ignore its recommendation’.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part953.htm#bookmark2309" class="s85" name="bookmark2301">Moreover, the commission has limited role, powers and jurisdiction with respect to the violation of human rights by the members of the armed forces</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">6</span>. In this sphere, the commission may seek a report from the Central government and make its recommendations. The Central government should inform the Commission of the action taken on the recommendations within three months.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The commission submits its annual or special reports to the Central government and to the state government concerned. These reports are laid before the respective legislatures, along with a memorandum of action taken on the recommendations of the commission and the reasons for non-acceptance of any of such recommendations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part950.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part952.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
