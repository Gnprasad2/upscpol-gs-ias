The salient features of this doctrine are as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. Building and maintaining a credible minimum deterrent.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. A posture of &quot;No First Use” - nuclear weapons will only be used in retaliation against a nuclear attack on Indian territory or on Indian forces anywhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. Nuclear retaliation to a first strike will be massive and designed to inflict unacceptable damage.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Nuclear retaliatory attacks can only be authorised by the civilian political leadership through the Nuclear Command Authority.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. Non-use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear weapon states.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. However, in the event of a major attack against India, or Indian forces anywhere, by biological or chemical weapons, India will retain the option of retaliating with nuclear weapons.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">7. A continuance of strict controls on export of nuclear and missile related materials and technologies, participation in the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty negotiations, and continued observance of the moratorium on nuclear tests.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">8. Continued commitment to the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world, through global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Nuclear Command Authority comprises a Political Council and an Executive Council. The Political Council is chaired by the Prime Minister. It is the sole body which can authorise the use of nuclear weapons.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Executive Council is chaired by the National Security Advisor. It provides inputs for decision making by the Nuclear Command Authority and executes the directives given to it by the Political Council.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) reviewed the progress in the operationalising of India’s nuclear doctrine. The CCS reviewed the existing command and control structures, the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">state of readiness, the targeting strategy for a retaliatory attack, and operating procedures for various stages of alert and launch. The CCS expressed satisfaction with the overall preparedness.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The CCS approved the appointment of a Commander-in-Chief, Strategic Forces Command, to manage and administer all Strategic Forces. The CCS also reviewed and approved the arrangements for alternate chains of command for retaliatory nuclear strikes in all eventualities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1237.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1239.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
