This means that the civil servant who made a contract in his official capacity is not personally liable in respect of that contract but it is the government (Central or state) that is liable for the contract. But, if the contract is made without complying the conditions specified in the Constitution, then the civil servant who made the contract is personally liable. Further, the civil servants also enjoy immunity from legal liability for their tortious acts in respect of the sovereign functions of the government. In other cases, the liability of the civil servants for torts or illegal acts is the same as of any ordinary citizen. Civil proceedings can be instituted against them for anything done in their official capacity after giving a two monthsâ€™ advance notice. But, no such notice is required when the action is to be brought against them for the acts done outside the scope of their official duties. Criminal proceedings can be instituted against them for acts done in their official capacity, with the prior permission of the president or the governor, where necessary</a><a href="part1064.htm#bookmark2564" class="s14">6</a> <span class="p">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: -77pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2557">Table 67.1 </a><i>Articles Related to Rights and Liabilities of the Government at a Glance</i></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part1063.htm">Article No. Subject-matter</a><a class="toc0" href="part1064.htm">NOTES AND REFERENCES</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part1061.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1063.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
