Consequently, the Centre cannot delegate its legislative powers to the states and a single state cannot request the Parliament to make a law on a state subject. The distribution of executive power in general follows the distribution of legislative powers. But, such a rigid division in the executive sphere may lead to occasional conflicts between the two. Hence, the Constitution provides for inter- government delegation of executive functions in order to mitigate rigidity and avoid a situation of deadlock.</p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part350.htm#bookmark758" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 14pt;" name="bookmark725">Accordingly, the President may, with the consent of the state government, entrust to that government any of the executive functions of the Centre. Conversely, the governor of a state may, with the consent of the Central government, entrust to that government any of the executive functions of the state.</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">6</span> <span class="s45">This mutual delegation of administrative functions may be conditional or unconditional.</span></p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The Constitution also makes a provision for the entrustment of the executive functions of the Centre to a state without the consent of that</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">state. But, in this case, the delegation is by the Parliament and not by the president. Thus, a law made by the Parliament on a subject of the Union List can confer powers and impose duties on a state, or authorise the conferring of powers and imposition of duties by the Centre upon a state (irrespective of the consent of the state concerned). Notably, the same thing cannot be done by the state legislature.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">From the above, it is clear that the mutual delegation of functions between the Centre and the state can take place either under an agreement or by a legislation. While the Centre can use both the methods, a state can use only the first method.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part325.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part327.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
