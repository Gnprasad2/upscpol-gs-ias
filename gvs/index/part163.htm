Further, where the terms used in any article are ambiguous or capable of more than one meaning, some assistance at interpretation may be taken from the objectives enshrined in the Preamble. Despite this recognition of the significance of the Preamble, the Supreme Court specifically opined that Preamble is <i>not </i>a part of the Constitution.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark272">In the </a><i>Kesavananda Bharati </i><a href="part165.htm#bookmark293" class="s85">case</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">17</span><span class="s15"> </span>(1973), the Supreme Court rejected the earlier opinion and held that Preamble <i>is </i>a part of the Constitution. It observed that the Preamble is of extreme importance and the Constitution should be read and interpreted in the light of the grand and noble vision expressed in the Preamble. In the <i>LIC of India </i><a href="part165.htm#bookmark294" class="s85">case</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">18</span><span class="s15"> </span>(1995) also, the Supreme Court again held that the Preamble is an integral part of the Constitution.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part165.htm#bookmark295" class="s85" name="bookmark273">Like any other part of the Constitution, the Preamble was also enacted by the Constituent Assembly; but, after the rest of the Constitution was already enacted. The reason for inserting the Preamble at the end was to ensure that it was in conformity with the Constitution as adopted by the Constituent Assembly. While forwarding the Preamble for votes, the President of the Constituent Assembly said, &#39;The question is that Preamble stands part of the Constitutionâ€™</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: 5pt;">19</span>. The motion was then adopted. Hence, the current opinion held by the Supreme Court that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution, is in consonance with the opinion of the founding fathers of the Constitution.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, two things should be noted:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. The Preamble is neither a source of power to legislature nor a prohibition upon the powers of legislature.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. It is non-justiciable, that is, its provisions are not enforceable in courts of law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part162.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part164.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
