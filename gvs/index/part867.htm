Municipality</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The municipalities are established for the administration of towns and smaller cities. Like the corporations, they are also set up in the states by the acts of the concerned state legislatures and in the union territory by the acts of the Parliament of India. They are also known by various other names like municipal council, municipal committee, municipal board, borough municipality, city municipality and others.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">Like a municipal corporation, a municipality also has three authorities, namely, the council, the standing committees and the chief executive officer.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The council is the deliberative and legislative wing of the municipality. It consists of the councillors directly elected by the people.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The council is headed by a president/chair-man. He is assisted by a vice-president/vice-chairman. He presides over the meetings of the council. Unlike the Mayor of a municipal corporation, he plays a significant role and is the pivot of the municipal administration. Apart from presiding over the meetings of the Council, he enjoys executive powers.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The standing committees are created to facilitate the working of the council. They deal with public works, taxation, health, finance and so on.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: justify;">The chief executive officer/chief municipal officer is responsible for day-to-day general administration of the municipality. He is appointed by the state government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part866.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part868.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
