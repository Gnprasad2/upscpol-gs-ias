Only the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution. Unlike a prorogation, a dissolution ends the very life of the existing House, and a new House is constituted after general elections are held. The dissolution of the Lok Sabha may take place in either of two ways:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. Automatic dissolution, that is, on the expiry of its tenure of five years or the terms as extended during a national emergency; or</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. Whenever the President decides to dissolve the House, which he is authorised to do. Once the Lok Sabha is dissolved before the completion of its normal tenure, the dissolution is irrevocable.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">When the Lok Sabha is dissolved, all business including bills, motions, resolutions, notices, petitions and so on pending before it or its committees lapse. They (to be pursued further) must be reintroduced in the newly-constituted Lok Sabha. However, some pending bills and all pending assurances that are to be examined by the Committee on Government Assurances do not lapse on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. The position with respect to lapsing of bills is as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses (whether originating in the Lok Sabha or transmitted to it by the Rajya Sabha).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. A bill passed by the Lok Sabha but pending in the Rajya Sabha lapses.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. A bill not passed by the two Houses due to disagreement and if the president has notified the holding of a joint sitting before the dissolution of Lok Sabha, does not lapse.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha but not passed by the Lok Sabha does not lapse.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. A bill passed by both Houses but pending assent of the president does not lapse.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. A bill passed by both Houses but returned by the president for reconsideration of Houses does not lapse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1141">Table 22.1 </a><i>Adjournment vs Prorogation</i></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part507.htm">Adjournment Prorogation</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part505.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part507.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
