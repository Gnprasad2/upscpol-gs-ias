Renewable Energy</h4><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Over the years, renewable energy sector in India has emerged as a significant player in the grid connected power generation capacity. It supports the government agenda of sustainable growth, while, emerging as an integral part of the solution to meet the nation’s energy needs and an essential player for energy access. It has been realized that renewable energy has to play a much deeper role in achieving energy security in the years ahead and be an integral part of the energy planning process.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span> <img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" "  onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_297.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There has been a visible impact of renewable energy in the Indian energy scenario during the last few years. Renewable energy sector landscape in India has, during the last few years, witnessed tremendous changes in the policy framework with accelerated and ambitious plans to increase the contribution of solar energy. There is a perception that renewable energy can now play a significant role, as also, there is a confidence in the technologies and capacity to do so.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Enlarging the scope of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission symbolizes both, and indeed encapsulates the vision and ambition for the future. In addition, the launching of Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) mechanism helps in the creation of a Pan-India renewable energy market. The other significant achievements are introduction of solar specific purchase obligations; launching of improved cook-stoves initiatives; initiating coordinated research and development activities in solar PV and thermal; second generation biofuels, hydrogen energy and fuel cells, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India has an estimated renewable energy potential of about 900 GW from commercially exploitable sources viz. Wind – 102 GW (at 80 meter mast height); Small Hydro – 20 GW; Bio- energy – 25 GW; and 750 GW solar power, assuming 3% wasteland.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In order to meet the energy demand, India has total installed power generation capacity of</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">307.27 GW as on 31.10.2016 from all resources. With 46.33 GW installed renewable power capacity, the renewable power has a share of about 15% to the total installed capacity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"> </p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During the year 2015-16, wind power capacity addition of 3.42 GW was made, which is highest ever wind power capacity addition in the country during a single year. The present wind power installed capacity in the country is around 34.29 GW. Now, in terms of wind power installed capacity India is globally placed at 4th position after China, USA and Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India has a strong manufacturing base of wind power equipment in the country. Presently, there are 20 approved manufacturers with 53 models of wind turbines in the country up to a capacity of 3.00 MW single turbines. Wind turbines being manufactured in India are of international quality standards and cost-wise amongst the lowest in the world being exported to Europe, USA and other countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The wind power potential of the country has been reassessed by the National Institute for Wind Energy (NIWE), it has been estimated to be 302 GW at 100 meter hub-height. Online wind atlas is available on NIWE website. This will create new dimension to the wind power development in the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India has long coastline where there is a good possibility for developing offshore wind power projects. The cabinet has cleared the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy and the same has been notified on 6th October 2015. Certain blocks near Gujarat and Tamil Nadu coast line have been identified. NIWE is in process of doing the wind resource assessment in these coastal areas.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part740.htm">9.1.
