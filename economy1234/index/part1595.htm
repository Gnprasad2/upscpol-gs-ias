They carry the principal objective of capital appreciation of the investment over the medium to long-term. They are best suited for investors who are seeking capital appreciation. There are different types of equity funds</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span> <img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" "  onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_602.png"/></span></p><p class="s120" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="s4">Diversified funds</span><span class="p">- These funds invest in companies spread across sectors. These funds are generally meant for risk-averse investors who want a diversified portfolio across sectors.</span></p><p class="s120" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="s4">Sector funds</span><span class="p">- These funds invest primarily in equity shares of companies in a particular business sector or industry. These funds are targeted at investors who are bullish or fancy the prospects of a particular sector.</span></p><p class="s120" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="s4">Index funds</span><span class="p">- These funds invest in the same pattern as popular market indices like CNX Nifty or CNX 500. The money collected from the investors is invested only in the stocks, which represent the index. For e.g. a Nifty index fund will invest only in the Nifty 50 stocks. The objective of such funds is not to beat the market but to give a return equivalent to the market returns.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s11"> </span><span class="s4">Tax Saving Funds</span><span class="p">- These funds offer tax benefits to investors under the Income Tax Act. Opportunities provided under this scheme are in the form of tax rebates under the Income Tax act.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s11"> </span><span class="s4">Debt/Income  Funds</span><span class="p">- These funds invest predominantly in high-rated  fixed-income- bearing instruments like bonds, debentures, government securities, commercial paper and other money market instruments. They are best suited for the medium to long- term investors who are averse to risk and seek capital preservation. They provide a regular income to the investor.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"> </p> <p class="s10" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s11"> </span><span class="s4">Liquid Funds/Money Market Funds</span><span class="p">- These funds invest in highly liquid money market instruments. The period of investment could be as short as a day. They provide easy liquidity. They have emerged as an alternative for savings and short-term fixed deposit accounts with comparatively higher returns.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s11"> </span><span class="s4">Gilt Funds- </span><span class="p">These funds invest in Central and State Government securities. Since they are Government backed bonds they give a secured return and also ensure safety of the principal amount. They are best suited for the medium to long-term investors who are averse to risk.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s11"> </span><span class="s4">Balanced Funds</span><span class="p">- These funds invest both in equity shares and fixed-income-bearing instruments (debt) in some proportion. They provide a steady return and reduce the volatility of the fund while providing some upside for capital appreciation. They are ideal for medium to long-term investors who are willing to take moderate risks.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">B. <u>On the basis of flexibility</u></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s11"> </span><span class="s4">Open-ended Funds</span><span class="p">- These funds do not have a fixed date of redemption. Generally they are open for subscription and redemption throughout the year. Their prices are linked to the daily net asset value (NAV). From the investors&#39; perspective, they are much more liquid than closed-ended funds.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s11"> </span><span class="s4">Close-ended Funds</span><span class="p">- These funds are open initially for entry during the Initial Public Offering (IPO) and thereafter closed for entry as well as exit. These funds have a fixed date of redemption. One of the characteristics of the close-ended schemes is that they</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are generally traded at a discount to NAV; but the discount narrows as maturity nears. These funds are open for subscription only once and can be redeemed only on the fixed date of redemption.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1594.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1596.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
