Introduction</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"> </p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The definition of food security has evolved over a period of time. As a concept, food security originated in the mid-1970s, in the wake of global food crisis. The initial focus of attention was assuring the availability and to some degree the price stability of basic foodstuffs at the international and national level. This was then broadened to incorporate the demand side of food security in early eighties. During the nineties issues such food safety, nutrition, dietary needs and food preferences were also considered important ingredients of food security.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In FAO report on ‘The State of Food Insecurity, 2001’ , food security is defined as a “ --- situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">World Summit on Food Security stated that the &quot;four pillars of food security” are availability,</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">access, utilization, and stability i.e. food security over time.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To accomplish all the above criteria, requires not only an <b>adequate supply of food </b>but also <b>enough purchasing power capacity </b>with the individual or household to demand adequate level of food.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Food Security vis-a-vis Constitution of India</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the Indian context, the underpinnings for food security of the people can be found in the Constitution, though there is no explicit provision on right to food.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The fundamental right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution has been interpreted by the Supreme Court and National Human Rights Commission to include right to live with human dignity, which includes the right to food and other basic necessities.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under Directive Principles of State Policy, it is provided under Article 47 that that the State shall regard raising the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Providing food security has been focus of the Government of India’s planning and policy. Attainment of self-sufficiency in foodgrains production at the national level has been one of the major achievements of the country. In order to address the issue of food security at the household level, Government is implementing the Targeted Public Distribution System under which subsidized foodgrains is provided to eligible households. To further strengthen the efforts to address the food security of the people, the Government has enacted the National Food Security Act, 2013.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part942.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part944.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
