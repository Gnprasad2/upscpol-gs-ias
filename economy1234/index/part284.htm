Weaknesses in Resource Allocation and Use</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many of the weaknesses in budgeting reflect the failure to address linkages between the various functions of budgeting. The following factors contribute to budget systems and processes that create a disabling environment for performance in the public sector, both by commission and by omission:</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Almost exclusive focus on inputs, with performance judged largely in terms of spending no more, or less, than appropriated in the budget;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Input focus takes a short-term approach to budget decision making; failure to adequately take account of longer-term costs (potential and real), and biases in the choice of policy instruments (e.g., between capital and current spending and between spending, doing, and regulation) because of the short-term horizon;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">A bottom-up approach to budgeting that means that even if the ultimate stance of fiscal policy was appropriate (and increasingly after 1973 it was not) game playing by both line and central agencies led to high transaction costs to squeeze the bottom-up bids into the appropriate fiscal policy box;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">A tendency to budget in real terms, leading either to pressure on aggregate spending where inflation is significant (which was often validated through supplementary appropriations) or arbitrary cuts during budget execution with adverse consequences at the agency level;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Cabinet decision making focused on distributing the gains from fiscal drag across new spending proposals;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Cabinet and/or central agencies extensively involved in micro-decision making on all aspects of funding for ongoing policy;</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span> <img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" "  onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_123.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Weak decision making and last-minute cuts cause unpredictability of funding for existing government policy; this is highlighted to the centre by central budget agencies on the alert to identify and rake back “fortuitous savings;”</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Strong incentives to spend everything in the budget early in the year and as quickly as possible, since  the current year’s spending is the starting point for the annual budget haggle and the fear of across-the-board cuts during execution;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Existing policy itself (as opposed to its funding) subject to very little scrutiny from one year to the next.
