Deficit Reduction</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Government deficit can be reduced by an increase in taxes or reduction in expenditure. In India, the government has been trying to increase tax revenue with greater reliance on direct taxes (indirect taxes are regressive in nature â€“ they impact all income groups equally). There has also been an attempt to raise receipts through the sale of shares in PSUs.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, the major thrust has been towards reduction in government expenditure. This could be achieved through making government activities more efficient through better planning of programmes and better administration. A study by the Planning Commission had estimated that to transfer Re 1 to the poor, government spends Rs 3.65 in the form of food subsidy, showing that cash transfers would lead to increase in welfare. The other way is to change the scope of the government by withdrawing from some of the areas where it operated before.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cutting back government programmes in vital areas like agriculture, education, health, poverty alleviation, etc. would adversely affect the economy. Governments in many countries run huge deficits forcing them to eventually put in place self-imposed constraints of not increasing expenditure over pre-determined levels. In India, we also adopted FRBM Act explained in the next section.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Larger deficits do not always signify a more expansionary fiscal policy. The same fiscal measures can give rise to a large or small deficit, depending on the state of the economy. For example, if an economy experiences a recession and GDP falls, tax revenues fall because firms and households pay lower taxes when they earn less. This means that the deficit increases in a recession and falls in a boom, even with no change in fiscal policy</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part215.htm">4.5.1.
