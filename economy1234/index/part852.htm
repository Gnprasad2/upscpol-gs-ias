As mentioned earlier infrastructure projects involve huge financing requirements, most of which are met by banks and other financial institutions directly and indirectly. Thus, it is very important to make the project commercially viable to ensure regular servicing of the loan. This will lead to sustainable development of infrastructure without jeopardizing the soundness of the financial sector. Project appraisal and follow-up capabilities of many banks, particularly public sector banks, also need focused attention and upgradation so that project viability can be properly evaluated and risk mitigants provided where needed.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Greater Participation of State Governments - </span><span class="p">In a federal country like India, participation and support of the State governments is essential for developing high quality infrastructure. The State governments’ support in maintenance of law and order, land acquisition, rehabilitation and settlement of displaced persons, shifting of utilities, and obtaining environmental clearances are necessary for the projects undertaken by the Central Government or the private sector. It is satisfying to know that many State governments have also initiated several PPP projects for improving infrastructure.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span> <img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" "  onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_344.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Improving efficiency of the Corporate Bond Market - </span><span class="p">Vibrant corporate bond market will reduce the dependence on the banking sector for funds. Further, coordinated regulatory initiatives could be considered in the areas involving standardization of stamp duties on corporate bonds across the states, encouraging public issuance and bringing in institutional investors in a big way. It is also important to broad base the investor base by bringing in new classes of institutional investors (like insurance companies, pension funds, provident funds, etc.) apart from banks into this market.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Credit Enhancement - </span><span class="p">One of the major obstacles in attracting foreign debt capital for infrastructure is the sovereign credit rating ceiling. Domestic investors are also inhibited due to high level of credit risk perception, particularly in the absence of sound bankruptcy framework. A credit enhancement mechanism can possibly bridge the rating cap between the investment norms, risk perceptions and actual ratings</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Simplification of Procedures – Enabling Single Window Clearance - </span><span class="p">It is well recognized that while funding is the major problem for infrastructure financing, there are other issues which aggravate the problems of raising funds. These include legal disputes regarding land acquisition, delay in getting other clearances (leading to time and cost overruns) and linkages (e.g. coal, power, water, etc.) among others. It is felt that in respect of mega- projects, beyond certain cut-off point, single window clearance approach could cut down the implementation period.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part851.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part853.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
