The total nationalised banks in the country are 19. Some examples are – IDBI, Indian bank, Dena Bank etc. Therefore, total number of Public sector commercial banks are (1+6+19) = 26.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"> </p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Before Nationalization kicked in, several sectors of the economy such as agriculture, small- scale industries and weaker sections of the society were relatively ignored by the banking system of the country. For example, the agricultural sector only received 2.1% of the total credit as it stood in March 1967 compared to a humungous 64% for the industry. The banking facilities were earlier concentrated mainly in the urban areas. Though there were some banks in the rural areas, they were mainly for deposits and the money was used to lend in the urban areas. Even in the urban areas, the banking facilities were enjoyed by the rich people. The banks were mainly owned by industrialists and they used these banks to mobilise deposits of people and themselves got a loan from these banks.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Government of India had, therefore, to impose some control over banks with a view to prevent monopolistic trends, concentration of economic power and misuse of economic resources. Thus the basic goal of social control was to achieve the social ends without taking over the banks into public ownership.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some of the <b>objectives of nationalization of the banks </b>in 1980 were:</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">To mobilize savings of people to the maximum possible and to utilize them for productive purpose.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">To ensure that the banking operations are guided by a larger social purpose and are subject to close public regulations;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">To ensure that the legitimate credit needs of private sector industry and trade, big and small, are met;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">To ensure the needs of the productive sector and in particular, agriculture, small scale industry, self-employed professionals are met;</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">To actively foster the growth of the new and progressive class of entrepreneurs and create fresh opportunities for hitherto neglected and backward areas in different parts of the country; and</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;  text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">To curb the use of bank credit for speculative and for other unproductive purposes.
