Qualitative Credit Control Methods</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These are those tools through which the central bank not only controls the value of loans but also the purpose for which these loans are assigned by the commercial banks. Some of these are:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Moral Suasion: </b>Moral suasion means persuasion and request. To arrest inflationary situation central bank persuades and requests the commercial banks to refrain from giving loans for speculative and non-essential purposes. On the other hand, to counter deflation central bank persuades the commercial banks to extend credit for different purposes. Under Moral Suasion, RBI issues periodical letters to bank to exercise control over credit in general  or advances against particular  commodities.  Periodic discussions are held  with authorities of commercial banks in this respect. In India, from 1949 onwards the Reserve Bank has been successful in using the method of moral suasion to bring the commercial banks to fall in line with its policies regarding credit.</p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Rationing of credit</b><span class="s34">: </span>Rationing of credit is a method by which the Reserve Bank seeks to limit the maximum amount of loans and advances, and also in certain cases, fix ceiling for specific categories of loans and advances. RBI also makes credit flow to certain priority or weaker sectors by charging concessional rates of interest. This is at times also referred to as Priority Sector Lending.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Regulation of Consumer Credit</b><span class="s35">: </span>Now-a-days, most of the consumer durables like Cars, Televisions, and Laptops etc. are available on installment basis financed through bank credit. Such credit made available by commercial banks for the purchase of consumer durables is known as consumer credit.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If there is excess demand for certain consumer durables leading to their high prices, central bank can reduce consumer credit by (a) increasing down payment, and (b) reducing the number of installments of repayment of such credit.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, if there is deficient demand for certain specific commodities causing deflationary situation, central bank can increase consumer credit by (a) reducing down payment and (b) increasing the number of installments of repayment of such credit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span> <img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" "  onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_065.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. <b>Direct action: </b>This method is adopted when a commercial bank does not co-operate with the central bank in achieving its desirable objectives. Direct action may be any many forms:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Central banks may charge a penal rate of interest over and above the bank rate upon the defaulting banks; Central bank may refuse to rediscount the bills of those banks which are not following its directives; Central bank may refuse to grant further accommodation to those banks whose borrowings are in excess of their capital and reserves.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. <b>Margin Requirements: </b>Generally, commercial banks give loan against ‘stocks or ‘securities’. While giving loans against stocks or securities they keep margin. Margin is the difference between the market value of a security and its maximum loan value. Let us assume, a commercial bank grants a loan of Rs. 8000 against a security worth Rs. 10,000. Here, margin is Rs. 2000 or 20%.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If central bank feels that prices of some goods are rising due to the speculative activities of businessmen and traders of such goods, it wants to discourage the flow of credit to such speculative activities. Therefore, it increases the margin requirement in case of borrowing for speculative business and thereby discourages borrowing. This leads to reduction in money supply for undertaking speculative activities and thus inflationary situation is arrested.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"> </p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On other contrary, central bank can encourage borrowing from the commercial banks by reducing the margin requirement. When there is a greater flow of credit to different business activities, investment is increased. Income of the people rises. Demand for goods expands and deflationary situation is controlled.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, margin requirement is a significant tool in the hands of central bank to counter-act inflation and deflation.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part140.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part142.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
