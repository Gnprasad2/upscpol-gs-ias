It also plays a key role in building up institutions, markets and democracy through making the state accountable to its taxpayers. Rich and poor country governments have agreed on the importance of tax for development for years. The 2002 Monterrey Consensus, which launched a new focus on development recognised the key role of taxation in mobilising domestic resources-90% of domestic revenue is usually derived from tax.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Setting up an efficient and fair tax system is, however, far from simple, particularly for developing countries that want to become integrated in the international economy. The ideal tax system  in these countries should raise essential revenue without excessive government borrowing, and should do so without discouraging economic activity and without deviating too much from tax systems in other countries. Major problems associated with taxation in developing countries are:</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">First, most workers in these countries are typically employed in agriculture or in small, informal enterprises. As they are seldom paid a regular, fixed wage, their earnings fluctuate, and many are paid in cash, &quot;off the books.&quot; The base for an income tax is therefore hard to calculate. Nor do workers in these countries typically spend their earnings in large stores that keep accurate records of sales and inventories. As a result, modern means of raising revenue, such as income taxes and consumer taxes, play a diminished role in these economies, and the possibility that the government will achieve high tax levels is virtually excluded.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"> </p> <p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Second, it is difficult to create an efficient tax administration without a well-educated and well-trained staff, when money is lacking to pay good wages to tax officials and to computerize the operation (or even to provide efficient telephone and mail services), and when taxpayers have limited ability to keep accounts. As a result, governments often take the path of least resistance, developing tax systems that allow them to exploit whatever options are available rather than establishing rational, modern, and efficient tax systems.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Third, because of the informal structure of the economy in many developing countries and because of financial limitations, statistical and tax offices have difficulty in generating reliable statistics. This lack of data prevents policymakers from assessing the potential impact of major changes to the tax system. As a result, marginal changes are often preferred over major structural changes, even when the latter are clearly preferable. This perpetuates inefficient tax structures.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Fourth, income tends to be unevenly distributed within developing countries. Although raising high tax revenues in this situation ideally calls for the rich to be taxed more heavily than the poor, the economic and political power of rich taxpayers often allows them to prevent fiscal reforms that would increase their tax burdens. This explains in part why many developing countries have not fully exploited personal income and property taxes and why their tax systems rarely achieve satisfactory progressivity.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In conclusion, in developing countries, tax policy is often the art of the possible rather than the pursuit of the optimal. It is therefore not surprising that economic theory and especially optimal taxation literature have had relatively little impact on the design of tax systems in these countries.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part196.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part198.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
