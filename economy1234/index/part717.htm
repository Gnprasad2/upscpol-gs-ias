Energy Efficiency Mission</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The following were the main components of the Energy Efficiency Mission.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Standards and Labelling of Equipment &amp; Appliances</span><span class="p">: The scheme is invoked for 21 equipment/appliances including 7 for which it is mandatory. It provides users with information on the energy use of a model, and its relative efficiency as compared to others. It has been made mandatory for air conditioners, refrigerators, distribution transformers and tube lights.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Energy Efficiency in Buildings</span><span class="p">: The Energy Conservation Building Code 2017 (ECBC 2017) has been developed by the Ministry of Power and Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). In order for a building to be considered ECBC-compliant, it would need to demonstrate minimum energy savings of 25%. Additional improvements in energy efficiency performance would enable the new buildings to achieve higher grades like ECBC Plus or Super ECBC status leading to further energy savings of 35% and 50%, respectively. With the adoption of ECBC 2017 for new commercial building construction throughout the country, it is estimated to achieve a 50% reduction in energy use by 2030. This will translate to energy savings of about 300 Billion Units by 2030 and peak demand reduction of over 15 GW in a year. This will be equivalent to expenditure savings of Rs. 35,000 crore and 250 million tonnes of CO2 reduction.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Energy Efficiency in Industry</span><span class="p">: Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, is a component under National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE). PAT is a market based mechanism to enhance cost effectiveness through certification of excess energy savings in energy intensive industries that can be traded.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Energy Efficiency in Agricultural Pumping</span><span class="p">: Smart BEE star rated Energy Efficient Agricultural Pump sets are to be distributed to farmers. Farmers can replace their inefficient agricultural pump sets free of cost. Pumps to come with Smart Control Panes that has a SIM card and a Smart Meter. Smart Control Panel will enable a farmer to switch on or switch off these pumps through his mobile and sitting at the comfort of his home. Smart meters ensure that the farmers can monitor  consumption  on a real time basis. Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) is to distribute 2,00,000 BEE star-rated pump-sets to the farmers under this programme, which will lead to 30% of energy savings by 2019. This translates into an annual savings of approximately Rs. 20,000 crore on agricultural subsidies or a saving of 50 billon units of energy per year.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="s4">Residential Lighting</span><span class="p">: The Bachat Lamp Yojana (BLY) was initiated to provide CFLs to households at the cost of incandescent bulbs.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme (DELP) </b>The Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for  All (UJALA) scheme was launched to provide LED bulbs to domestic consumers aiming to replace 77 crore incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs<span class="s70">. </span>The e<span class="s11">-</span>procurement of LED bulbs through a transparent and competitive bidding process under UJALA has resulted in reduction of approximately 88% in procurement prices of LED bulbs from Rs<span class="s70">. </span>310 in February, 2014 to Rs<span class="s70">. </span>38 in August 2016, the retail price being reduced from Rs<span class="s70">. </span>550 to  Rs<span class="s70">. </span>65, which is passed on to the consumers<span class="s70">. </span>A total of 5<span class="s70">.</span>96 crore of dwelling units have been provided LED bulbs under the UJALA scheme, as on 20<span class="s70">.</span>11<span class="s70">.</span>16<span class="s70">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s71" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">  ♤       </span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">The </span><span class="s4">Street Lighting National Programme </span>(<span class="s4">SLNP</span>) <span class="p">aims to replace 3</span>.<span class="p">5 crore conventional street lights with smart and energy efficient LED street lights by March, 2019</span>.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) has issued Secured, Redeemable, Taxable, Non- Cumulative, Non-Convertible Bonds in the nature of Debentures in dematerialized form of Rs. 500 Crores in the month of September, 2016 for the purpose of financing the various</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">energy efficiency projects, which was fully subscribed.
