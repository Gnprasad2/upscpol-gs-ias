Promoting Road Safety</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Government has increasingly focused on improving safety, efficiency and sustainability in the transport sector as only a safe system can be sustainable in the long run. A few steps taken in this regard are as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span> <img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" "  onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_255.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A National Road Safety Policy had been approved, outlining various policy measures like promoting awareness, establishing road safety information data base, encouraging safer road infrastructure, enforcement of safety laws etc. The Ministry has evolved a multi-pronged strategy to tackle the problem based on the 4 E’s viz Education, Engineering (both of roads and vehicles) Enforcement and Emergency Care. A National Road Safety Council had also been constituted as the apex body to take policy decisions in the matter of road safety.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Top priority has been accorded to correction of black spots on National Highways and adopting regulatory measures for improving automobile safety. The Ministry has requested the States to send proposals for correction of black spots and 10% of the Central Road Fund (CRF) has been permitted to be used for undertaking road safety measures. Road safety has been made an integral  part of  road  designing, safety audits are being  taken  up  for  selected  stretches of National Highways. As short-term measures rumble strips, reflective stickers at junctions, fixing signboard/ cautionary board, providing signage and speed restrictions are being used. As long- term measures construction of vehicular under-pass, By-pass, flyover and 4-laning are being taken up.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An amount of Rs. 1100 crore has been made available for the road safety purposes during the years 2015-16 and 2016-17. The Ministry has stressed upon States / UTs to set up State Road Safety Councils,  formulate an action plan for improving road safety, implement it in a concerted manner, fix a definite, time bound target for fatality reduction and identify and allocate adequate manpower, financial and other resources for implementing the strategy to achieve the targets set.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"> </p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Ministry has launched a media campaign to promote road safety.
