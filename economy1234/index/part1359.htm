Procurement of <b>wheat and paddy </b>for the Central Pool is carried out on <b>open ended basis </b>(i.e., accepting all the grains that are sold to it by farmers) at the declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) fixed by the GOI. In addition, Sates / Union Territories (UTs), which are presently under <b>Decentralised Procurement (DCP) scheme </b>also procure foodgrains for the Central Pool, but directly store and distribute them under Targeted Public Distribution System [TPDS] and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS) based on the allocation made by the GOI. Any surplus stock over their requirement is taken over by FCI and in case of any shortfall in procurement against allocation made by the GOI, FCI meets the deficit out of the Central Pool.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The procured food grains are taken over from State Government Agencies (SGAs) and private rice millers into the Central Pool b<b>y FCI and are moved from the procuring states to the consuming states </b>for distribution to the consumers and for creation of buffer stock in various states. Food grains of the Central Pool are stored by FCI in both its own godowns and at hired godowns in different parts of the country. FCI, if so required, may use warehouse receipts as collateral for financing its operations.
