Public Sector De-Reservation and Privatization through Dis-Investment<span class="p">:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Till 1991, Public Sector was assigned a pre-eminent position in Indian Industry to enable it to achieve “commanding heights of the economy” under the Industrial Policy Resolution (IPR), 1956. Accordingly, areas of strategic importance and core sectors were exclusively reserved for public sector enterprises. Public enterprises were accorded preference even in areas where private investments were possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since 1991, the public sector policy consists of:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span> <img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" "  onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_209.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Reduction in the number of industries reserved for public sector: Now only two industries (atomic energy and railway operations) are reserved for the Public Sector. The essence of government’s Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) policy since 1991 has been that government should not operate any commercial enterprises. The policy emphasized to bring down government equity in all non-strategic PSUs to 26 percent or lower, restructure or revive potentially viable PSUs, close down PSUs which cannot be revived and fully protect the interests of workers. Government’s withdrawal from non-core sectors is indicated on considerations of long-term efficient use of capital, growing financial un-viability and the compulsions for these PSUs to operate in an increasingly competitive and market oriented environment.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Implementation of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU): As a part of the measures to improve the performance of public enterprises, more and more of public sector units have been brought under the purview of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) system. A memorandum of understanding is a performance contract, a freely negotiated document between the Government and a specific public enterprise.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Referral to BIFR: Many sick public sector units have been referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) for rehabilitation or, where necessary, for winding up.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Manpower Rationalization: In order to achieve manpower rationalization, Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) has been introduced in a number of PSUs to shed the surplus manpower.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"> </p> <p class="s1" style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Private Equity Participation: PSUs have been allowed to raise equity finance from the capital market. This has put market pressure on PSUs to improve their performance.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Disinvestment and Privatization: Disinvestment and privatization of existing PSUs has been adopted to improve corporate efficiency, financial performance and competition amongst PSUs. It involves transfer of Government holding in PSUs to the private shareholders.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part531.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part533.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
