<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Such accidents pose a grave danger to wildlife, and to the conservation of our national biodiversity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Article 48A (DPSP) of the Indian Constitution, it is stated that the State shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Article 51A (Fundamental Duties) to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life and to have compassion for living creatures</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It is the duty of every citizen to preserve, protect and nourish our wildlife heritage, particularly since these animals are helpless in facing the challenge of biotic pressure.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>What has to be done?</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Coordination between MoEF and Railways has to be enhanced to ensure the safety of wildlife.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Vulnerable patches for wildlife to be identified as wild life crossing spots, and signage put up to warn train drivers and other railway personnel, to enable them to give directions for trains to slow down their speed in these patches in the normal course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Update the list of well known vulnerable patches for wild life, and conveying them to the Railways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Electronically tag prominent wildlife like elephants, leopards, etc particularly in high traffic areas, so that wildlife and forest personnel could keep track of their movements, and warn railway officials well in time to enable them to avoid accident. Once they are electronically tagged, forest personnel could track their movements, and keep them from harm.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Improvement in infrastructure for forest and Railway staff, such as, equipped with walkie talkies, constant connection with the control room, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In prominent wildlife areas, or wherever considered necessary, forest officials should be posted at Railway control rooms to coordinate with railway staff, informed regarding the movement of elephants, to enable railway authorities to take preventive action, well in advance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Strict instructions to all railway and forest field personnel, emphasizing the importance of the protection and conservation of wild life.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>7.6 . IMPACT OF RADIATION FROM MOBILE PHONE TOWERS ON HUMAN BEINGS AND WILDLIFE</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The remarkable increase in mobile phones users in the country and mushrooming of mobile tower installations in every nook and corner of cities and towns have raised concerns on its probable impact on wildlife and human health.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Health Impacts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Every antenna on cell phone tower radiates electro-magnetic power. One cell phone tower is being used by a number of operators, more the number of antennas more is the power intensity in the nearby area. The power level near towers is higher and reduces as we move away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">How the cell phone tower’s radiation affects the birds and bees?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The surface area of bird is relatively larger than their body weight in comparison to human body so they absorb more radiation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Also the fluid content in the body of the bird is less due to small body weight so it gets heated up very fast.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Magnetic field from the towers disturbs birds’ navigation skills hence when birds are exposed to EMR they disorient and begin to fly in all directions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A large number of birds die each year from collisions with telecommunication masts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">How the cell phone tower’s radiation affects human?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> EMR may cause cellular and psychological changes in human beings due to thermal effects that are generated due to absorption of microwave radiation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The exposure can lead to genetic defects, effects on reproduction and development, Central Nervous System behaviour etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> EMR can also cause non thermal effects which are caused by radio frequency fields at levels too low to produce significant heating and are due to movement of calcium and other ions across cell membranes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Such exposure is known to be responsible for fatigue, nausea, irritability, headaches, loss of appetite and other psychological disorders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The current exposure safety standards are purely based on the thermal effects considering few evidences from exposure to non thermal effects.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>7.7 GENETICALLY ENGINEERED (GE) TREES</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The proponents of biotechnology industry claim that trees that are genetically altered grow faster and yield better quality of wood in extreme temperatures. Thus they are a boon to forestry in dealing with climate change.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Historical background</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The first field trials of GE trees were started in Belgium in 1988, when researchers began to develop poplar trees that were herbicide resistant and that could grow faster. In 2002, China established commercial GE poplar trees plantation as a strategy to address the issue of deforestation. Initially GE trees were established in 300 hectares, and now China has embraced the GE technology on a large scale, integrating this into forestry sector. Latin American countries like Brazil and Argentina, the forerunners in GM food crops are also working on GE trees to enhance the production of pulp and paper.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Is GE trees safer than GM crops?</span><br><br><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>For:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The proponents of the technology claim that GE trees are safer and there is no need to fear about negative consequences. Already the United Nations has approved plantations of GE trees as carbon sinks under Kyoto Protocol’s clean development mechanism. With this stamp of approval, many countries would like to adopt the technology and establish GE plantations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Against:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Environmentalists state that this technology poses as serious a threat as GM crops. The trees are perennial, that live longer than agricultural crops. The changes in the metabolism of trees may occur many years after they are planted, and trees are wild, undomesticated. This makes it difficult to decipher as to how the introduced gene will behave in natural environment. This fact implies that the ecological risks associated with GE trees are far greater than the agricultural crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It has also been documented that the tree pollen travels a distance of more than 600 km. The probability that the GE tree pollen is likely to contaminate vast expanses of native forests with a wide variety of destructive traits may be a threat to ecological balance and the existing biodiversity of the tropical forests in global south. The contaminated pollen might pose threat to honey bees, adversely impacting pollination in the wild and on agriculture crops.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Who are behind developing GE trees and why?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It is ArborGen a subsidiary of Monsanto, oil companies like British Petroleum and Chevron that are investing in this technology. For these companies GE trees offer a viable alternate to fossil fuels as GE trees could produce ethanol, a green fuel. As the ethanol produced from food stocks came under attack, the companies see bright future in non-food cellulose feedstock like GE trees.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>In INDIA</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The first experiment with genetically engineered tree was with rubber tree developed by the Rubber Research Institute in Kerala. The GE rubber are better adapted to drought resistance and increased environment stress tolerance. This will help to establish rubber in non traditional areas where the conditions are not favourable. Ironically the field trials for GE rubber trees were approved by the then environmental minister (Mr. Jairam Ramesh). Ministry asserted that the genetically modified trees posed lesser threat in comparison to the food crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">This assumption is baseless as the seeds of rubber tree are used as cattle feed, that gets into the food chain through milk. Similarly, Kerala is one of those regions that produce large quantity of rubber honey from rubber plantations. Kerala, a GM free state worried about the implications of GE rubber on biodiversity, has voiced its concern about bio safety issues. Now the rubber trees are being experimented in Maharashtra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">These developments show the predominance of the western forestry science that lays emphasis on forests as a commercial entity to produce wood and pulp. Diverse forests were simplified by removal of multiple species and establishing monocultures that had commercial value. Already the country’s landscape is scarred with millions of hectares of teak and eucalypts mono culture plantations. This approach has had negative consequences for the environment, biodiversity and the local indigenous people. The same trend will be reinforced with the establishment of GE tree plantations, leading to further devastation of the natural environment and forests.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>7.8 MOEF BANNED DOLPHIN CAPTIVITY</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Ministry of Environment and Forests has banned dolphin captivity within India. This opens up a whole new discourse of ethics in the animal protection movement in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The unprecedented decision is particularly significant because it reflects an increasing global understanding that dolphins deserve better protections based on who - rather than what - they are.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Dolphinariums in India</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">India’s only experience of keeping dolphins was in the late 1990s. Four dolphins were imported from Bulgaria to Chennai’s Dolphin City, a substandard marine-themed amusement show, where they died within 6 months of arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">New proposals</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Several state governments had recently announced plans for the state tourism development corporations to establish dolphinariums for commercial dolphin shows. Dolphins are a major tourist attraction at amusement parks abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The major proposals that were made for similar establishments were by the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, the Kerala fisheries department in Kochi and a few private hoteliers in Noida in the National Capital Region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Why ban?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Cetaceans, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, are known to be highly intelligent animals. However, they do not adjust well to living in captivity. Confinement alters their behaviour and causes extreme distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The captivity industry exploit the lives of dolphins by denying them freedom and being allowed to cause them harm and the captivity industry has become adept at hiding the harm they cause to dolphins in their care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Despite the fact that some humane laws exist to prevent unnecessary cruelty, animals are still considered property and are usually denied the basic rights of life, liberty or freedom from harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The rights include not to be captured, confined, or killed, in order to prevent the suffering that they most likely experience when these rights are violated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Several countries, including Brazil, the United Kingdom and Chile, have banned dolphins in captivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The move by MoEF came after months of protests against a proposed dolphin park in the southern state of Kerala and plans for several other marine mammal parks in other parts of the country.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>MoEF order</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">According to the circular released by the Central Zoo Authority, states that because dolphins are by nature “highly intelligent and sensitive,” they ought to be seen as “nonhuman persons” and should have “their own specific rights.” It says that it is “morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">MoEF has asked all states to reject proposals for dolphinariums either by private parties or by government agencies, asking them not to allow import or capture of cetacean species and their use for commercial entertainment, and private or public exhibition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In India, the Gangetic Dolphin and Snubfin Dolphin are protected species as per the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The government has also declared Gangetic Dolphin as the national aquatic animal</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Various animal protection organisation under the banner of Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO), has campaigned in the country to ban the establishment of dolphinariums.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>7.9 PROHIBITION OF REMOVAL OF SHARK FINS IN THE SEA</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">With a view to stop the inhuman hunting of sharks and to enable the enforcement agencies to monitor the illegal hunting/poaching of the species of Sharks, Rays and Skates (Elasmobranchs) listed in Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, Minister of for Environment and Forests has approved a policy for prohibiting the removal of shark fins on board a vessel in the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The policy prescribes that any possession of shark fins that are not naturally attached to the body of the shark, would amount to “hunting” of a Schedule I species. The Policy calls for concerted action and implementation by the concerned State Governments through appropriate legislative, enforcement and other measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">They play an important the role in maintenance of the marine ecosystem like tigers and leopards in the forests. India is known to be home to about 40-60 species of sharks. However, the population of some of these have declined over the years due to several reasons including over exploitation and unsustainable fishing practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Due to high demand of shark fines in the shark fin-soup industry, it has been reported that the fins of the sharks captured in the mid sea are removed on the vessel and the de finned sharks are thrown back in the sea to die. This has resulted in in-human killing of large number of sharks and further decimated the population of Schedule I species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">This practice prevailing on board the shipping vessels has led to difficulties in enforcement of provisions of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 as it becomes difficult to identify the species of sharks from the fins alone, without the corresponding carcass, from which the fins have been detached.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>7.10 COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IN INDIA</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The annual cost of environmental degradation in India is about Rs. 3.75 trillion, or 5.7% of India’s 2009 gross domestic product (GDP), according to a report released by the World Bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The impact of outdoor air pollution on GDP is the highest and accounts for 1.7% of the GDP loss, said the report. Indoor air pollution is the second-biggest offender and costs India 1.3% of GDP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">“The higher costs for outdoor/indoor air pollution are primarily driven by an elevated exposure of the young and productive urban population to particulate matter pollution that results in a substantial cardiopulmonary and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (heart ailments) mortality load among adults,” the report said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The study, titled Diagnostic Assessment of Select Environmental Challenges in India, has taken into account environmental damage in India from urban air pollution, including particulate matter and lead; inadequate water supply; poor sanitation and hygiene; and indoor air pollution. Other factors that contribute to the loss include damage to natural resources because of worsening agricultural output because of an increase in soil salinity, water logging and soil erosion; rangeland degradation; deforestation and natural disasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">“Environmental pollution, degradation of natural resources, natural disasters and inadequate environmental services, such as improved water supply and sanitation, impose costs to society in the form of ill health, lost income, and increased poverty and vulnerability,” the report said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">A significant portion of diseases caused by poor water supply, sanitation and hygiene affect children younger than five, the report said. It attributed 23% of child mortality in the country to environmental degradation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Following the concept of growing economically now and cleaning up later will not be environmentally sustainable for the country in the long run, said the lead author of the report. The possible policy options to reduce particulate matter pollution could be incentivizing technology upgradation, securing efficiency improvements, strengthening enforcement and enhancing technology and efficiency standards.</span></p>
