<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> India emitted 2,136.84 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases in 2010.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Energy sector was the prime contributor to emissions and with 71% of total emissions in 2010. Energy sector includes - electricity production, fuel combustion in industries, transport and fugitive emissions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Industrial processes and product use contributed 8%; agriculture and waste sectors contributed 18% and 3% respectively to the national GHG inventory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> About 12% of emissions were offset by carbon sink action of forests and croplands, considering which the national GHG emissions are arrived at a total of 1,884.31 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> India’s per capita GHG emission in 2010 was 1.56 tCO2 equivalent, which is less than one- third of the world’s per capita emissions and far below than many developed and developing countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A reduction of emission intensity of GDP by about 12% between 2005 and 2010 has been achieved against our voluntary pledge to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25 per cent by 2020, compared with the 2005 level.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> India will continue to be a low-carbon economy (World Bank study).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> India’s primary focus is on “adaptation”, with specific focus for “mitigation”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> India has already unveiled a comprehensive National Action Plan on Climate Change whose activities are in the public domain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> India advocates collaborative research in future low-carbon technology and access to intellectual property rights (IPRs) as global public goods.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>22.2. OBSERVED CLIMATE AND WEATHER CHANGES IN INDIA</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">India’s National Communication (NATCOM) to UNF-CCC has consolidated some of the observed changes in climate parameters in India. No firm link between the documented changes described below and warming due to anthropogenic climate change has yet been established.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>22.2.1. Surface Temperature</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">At the national level, increase of — 0.4° C has been observed in surface air temperatures over the past century. A warming trend has been observed along the west coast, in central India, the interior peninsula, and north-eastern India. However, cooling trends have been observed in north-west India and parts of south India.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> While the observed monsoon rainfall at the all-India level does not show any significant trend, regional monsoon variations have been recorded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A trend of increasing monsoon seasonal rainfall has been found along the west coast, northern Andhra Pradesh, and north-western India (+10% to +12% of the normal over the last 100 years) while a trend of decreasing monsoon seasonal rainfall has been observed over eastern Madhya Pradesh, north-eastern India, and some parts of Gujarat and Kerala (-6% to —8% of the normal over the last 100 years).</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>22.2.3. Extreme Weather Events</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Instrument records over the past 130 years do not indicate any marked long-term trend in the frequencies of large-scale droughts and floods. Trends are however observed in multi-decadal periods of more frequent droughts, followed by less severe droughts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> There has been an overall increasing trend in severe storm incidence along the coast at the rate of 0.011 events per year. While the states of West Bengal and Gujarat have reported increasing trends, a decline has been observed in Orissa.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>22.2.4. Rise in Sea Level</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The records of coastal tide gauges in the north Indian Ocean for more than 40 years, reports that sea level rise was between 1.06-1.75 mm per year. These rates are consistent with 1-2 mm per year global sea level rise estimates of IPCC.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>22.2.5. Impacts on Himalayan Glaciers</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Himalayas possess one of the largest resources of snow and ice and its glaciers form a source of water for the perennial rivers such as the Indus, the Ganga, and the Brahmaputra.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Glacial melt may impact their long-term lean-season flows, with adverse impacts on the economy in terms of water availability and hydropower generation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The available monitoring data on Himalayan glaciers indicates that while recession of some glaciers has occurred in some Himalayan regions in recent years, the trend is not consistent across the entire mountain chain. It is accordingly, too early to establish long-term trends, or their causation, in respect of which there are several hypotheses.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Tripura is one of the highest CVP (Climate, Vegetation, Precipitation) index zones (a measure of potential productivity) in the country.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>22.3. CURRENT ACTIONS FOR ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION</span></h2></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Adaptation, in the context of climate change, comprises the measures taken to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change, e.g. relocating the communities living close to the sea shore, for instance, to cope with the rising sea level or switching to crops that can withstand higher temperatures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Mitigation comprises measures to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change in the first place, e.g. by switching to renewable sources of energy such as solar energy or wind energy, or nuclear energy instead of burning fossil fuel in thermal power stations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Current Indian government expenditure on adaptation to climate variability, exceeds 2.6% of the GDP, with agriculture, water resources, health and sanitation, forests, coastal-zone infrastructure and extreme weather events, being specific areas of concern.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>22.3.1. AGRICULTURE</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Two risk-financing programmes support adaptation to climate impacts. The Crop Insurance Scheme sup-ports the insurance of farmers against climate risks, and the Credit Support Mechanism facilitates the extension of credit to farmers, especially for crop failure due to climate variability.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>22.3.2. CROP IMPROVEMENT</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The present programmes address measures such as development of arid-land crops and pest management, as well as capacity building of extension workers and NGOs to support better vulnerability reducing practices.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>22.3.4. FORESTRY</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> India has a strong and rapidly growing afforestation programme. The afforestation process was accelerated by the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which aimed at stopping the clearing and degradation of forests through a strict, centralized control of the rights to use forest land and mandatory requirements of compensatory afforestation in case of any diversion of forest land for any non-forestry purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In addition an aggressive afforestation and sustainable forest management programme resulted in annual reforestation of 1.78 mha during 1985-1997, and is currently 1.1 mha annually. Due to this, the carbon stocks in Indian forests have increased over the last 20 years (during 1986 to 2005) to 9 -10 gigatons of carbon (GtC).</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In coastal regions, restrictions have been imposed in the area between 200m and 500m of the HTL (high tide line) while special restrictions have been imposed in the area up to 200m to protect the sensitive coastal ecosystems and prevent their exploitation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> This, simultaneously, addresses the concerns of the coastal population and their livelihood. Some specific measures taken in this regard include construction of coastal protection infrastructure and cyclone shelters, as well as plantation of coastal forests and mangroves.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>22.4. INDIA’S NATIONAL ACTION PLAN ON CLIMATE CHANGE</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In dealing with the challenge of climate change we must act on several fronts in a focused manner simultaneously. The National Action Plan hinges on the development and use of new technologies. The implementation of the Plan would be through appropriate institutional mechanisms suited for effective delivery of each individual Mission’s objectives and include public private partnerships and civil society action. The focus will be on promoting understanding of climate change, adaptation and mitigation, energy efficiency and natural resource conservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">There are Eight National Missions which form the core of the National Action Plan, representing multipronged, longterm and integrated strategies for achieving key goals in the context of climate change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Economic Survey 2011-12, suggests to make lower carbon sustainable growth a central element of our Twelfth Five Year Plan commencing in April 2012. The Survey points out that India’s per capita CO</span><span class="font12">2 </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">emissions are much lower (1.52 CO</span><span class="font12">2 </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">tons) than those of the developed countries even if historical emissions are excluded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">A rainforest is a forested biome with high annual rainfall. Tropical rainforests arise due to the inter-tropical convergence zone. The largest tropical rainforests exist in the Amazon basin, Nicaragua, equatorial Africa, southeastern Asia from Myanmar to Indonesia, eastern Queensland and part of Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The beneficial effects of rain forests are manifold. It is also called “lungs of the world” and act as major consumers of atmospheric carbon and play a large role in cooling air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It is estimated that the rainforests were reduced by about 58,000 km<sup>2</sup> annually in the 1990s. Rainforests used to cover 14% of the Earth’s surface. This percentage is now down to 6% and it is estimated by study that the remaining natural rainforests could disappear within 40 years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The concept of ‘Nationally Determined Contributions’, taking into account the outcomes of both Warsaw COP 19 and Lima COP 20 has to (i) reflect the principles of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) and (ii) the Country’s contributions must be seen in a balanced and comprehensive context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">India declared a voluntary goal of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 20-25%, over 2005 levels by 2020, despite having no binding mitigation obligations as per the Convention. A slew of policy measures to promote low carbon strategies and Renewable Energy have resulted in the decline of emission intensity of our GDP by 12% between 2005 and 2010. It is a matter of satisfaction that United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in its Emission Gap Report 2014 has recognized India as one of the countries on course to achieving its voluntary goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">INDC outlines the post-2020 climate actions they intend to take under a new international agreement. The INDC centre around India’s policies and programmes on promotion of clean energy, especially renewable energy, enhancement of energy efficiency, development of less carbon intensive and resilient urban centres, promotion of waste to wealth, safe, smart and sustainable green transportation network, abatement of pollution and India’s efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. It also captures citizens and private sector contribution to combating climate change.</span></p>
