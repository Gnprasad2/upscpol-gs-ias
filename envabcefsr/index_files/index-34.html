<h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold; color: midnightblue;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>CLIMATE CHANGE ORGANIZATIONS</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>23.1. UNFCCC</span></h2></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> UN Summit Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janerio in June 1992 adopted, by consensus, the first multilateral legal instrument on Climate Change, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change or the UNFCCC.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In 1992, countries joined UNFCCC, to cooperatively consider what they could do to limit average global temperature increases and the resulting climate change, and to cope with whatever impacts were, by then, inevitable. There are now 195 Parties to the Convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The UNFCCC secretariat supports all institutions involved in the international climate change negotiations, particularly the Conference of the Parties (COP), the subsidiary bodies (which advise the COP), and the COP Bureau (which deals mainly with procedural and organizational issues arising from the COP and also has technical functions).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> All subsequent multilateral negotiations on different aspects of climate change, including both adaptation and mitigation, are being held based on the principles and objectives set out by the UNFCCC.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The major difference Tortoise vs turtle being that the land dwelling ones are called Tortoises and water dwelling are called Turtles. Tortoise are herbivorous where as turtle are omnivorous</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>23.2. KYOTO PROTOCOL: COP-3.</span></h2></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> By 1995, countries realized that emission reductions provisions in the Convention were inadequate. They launched negotiations to strengthen the global response to climate change, and, two years later, adopted the Kyoto Protocol.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997. Due to a complex ratification process, it entered into force on 16 February 2005.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In short, the Kyoto Protocol is what “operationalizes” the Convention. It commits industrialized countries to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions based on the principles of the Convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The major distinction between the Protocol and the Convention is that while the Convention encouraged industrialized countries to stabilize GHG emissions, the Protocol commits them to do so.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>23.2.1. Targets</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> KP, as it is referred to in short, sets binding emission reduction targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community in its first commitment period.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It only binds developed countries because it recognizes that they are largely responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere, which are the result of more than 150 years of industrial activity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> KP places a heavier burden on developed nations under its central principle: that of “common but differentiated responsibility”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Overall, these targets add up to an average five per cent emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008 to 2012.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The architecture of the KP regime: What makes</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">KP tick?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Kyoto Protocol is made up of essential architecture that has been built and shaped over almost two decades of experience, hard work and political will. The beating heart of KP is made up of:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Reporting and verification procedures;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Flexible market-based mechanisms, which in turn have their own governance procedures; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. A compliance system.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">So, two things make KP tick.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Emissions Reduction Commitments</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The first was binding emissions reduction commitments for developed country parties. This meant the space to pollute was limited.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Greenhouse gas emissions, most prevalently carbon dioxide, became a new commodity. KP now began to internalize what was now recognized as an unpriced externality.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Indian Water Monitor lizard is one of the largest as well as the heaviest species of lizards, second only to the Komodo Monitors</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">2. Flexible Market Mechanisms</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> This leads us to the second, the flexible market mechanisms of the KP, based on the trade of emissions permits. KP countries bound to targets have to meet them largely through domestic action— that is, to reduce their emissions onshore.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> But they can meet part of their targets through three “market-based mechanisms” that ideally encourage GHG abatement to start where it is most cost-effective--for example, in the developing world. Quite simply, it does not matter where emissions are reduced, as long as they are removed from the planet’s atmosphere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Kyoto Flexible Market Protocol mechanisms:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Joint Implementation (JI)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Emission Trading</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>23.2.2. The objectives of Kyoto mechanisms:</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Its objective is to facilitate, promote and enforce compliance with the commitments under the Protocol.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Stimulate sustainable development through technology transfer and investment</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Help countries with Kyoto commitments to meet their targets by reducing emissions or removing carbon from the atmosphere in other countries in a cost-effective way</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Encourage the private sector and developing countries to contribute to emission reduction efforts</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Joint Implementation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The mechanism known as “joint implementation”, allows a country with an emission reduction or limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B Party - developed country) to earn emission reduction units (ERUs) from an emission-reduction or emission removal project in another Annex B Party, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2, which can be counted towards meeting its Kyoto target.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Joint implementation offers Parties a flexible and cost-efficient means of fulfilling a part of their Kyoto commitments, while the host Party benefits from foreign investment and technology transfer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Projects starting as from the year 2000 may be eligible as JI projects, ERU issued from 2008</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Clean Development mechanism:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows a country with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B Party) to implement an emission-reduction project in developing countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It is the first global, environmental investment and credit scheme of its kind, providing standardized emissions offset instrument, CERs</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Such projects can earn saleable certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2, which can be counted towards meeting Kyoto targets.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Example</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A CDM project activity might involve, for example, a rural electrification project using solar panels or the installation of more energy-efficient boilers. The mechanism stimulates sustainable development and emission reductions, while giving industrialized countries some flexibility in how they meet their emission reduction or limitation targets.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Most of the CDM projects were implemented in China and India as climate in these countries is favorable for implementing projects for almost all the spheres such as Agriculture, Waste handling and disposal, Afforestation and reforestation. Such CDM projects are also to be supported by the approval of Annex B countries -those which have quantified obligations according Kyoto Protocol.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Carbon Trading:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Carbon trading is the name given to the exchange of emission permits. This exchange may take place within the economy or may take the form of international transaction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Two types of Carbon trading:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Emission trading and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Offset trading.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Emission trading/ ‘cap-and-trade’,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Emission permit is known alternatively as carbon credit. For each Annex I country, the protocol has assigned a fixed amount of carbon emission in the agreement. This amount is actually the amount of emission which is to be reduced by the concerned country.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> On the other hand, it implies that the country was permitted to emit the remaining amount. This emission allowance is actually one kind of carbon credit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The total amount of allowance is then subdivided into certain units. The units are expressed in terms of carbon-equivalent. Each unit gives the owner the right to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide or other equivalent green-house gases.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Offset Trading/ Carbon Project/ ‘baseline-and credit’ trading:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Another variant of carbon credit is to be earned by a country by investing some amount of money in such projects, known as carbon projects, which will emit lesser amount of green-house gas in the atmosphere.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> For example, suppose a thermal plant of 800 megawatt capacity emit 400 carbon-equivalent in the atmosphere. Now a country builds up a 800 megawatt wind energy plant which does not generate any amount of emission as an alternative of the thermal plant. Then by investing in this project the country will earn 400 carbon-equivalent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> According to an estimate made by the World Bank’s Carbon Finance Unit, volume of carbon trade through Emission Trading route alone had shown a 240 percent increase in 2005 over the previous year.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefits of Flexible Market Mechanisms</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> This has the parallel benefits of stimulating green investment in developing countries and of including the private sector in this endeavour to cut and hold steady GHG emissions at a safe level.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It also makes “leap-frogging” more economical that is, the possibility to skip older, dirtier technology for newer, cleaner infrastructure and systems, with obvious longer-term benefits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Kyoto Protocol compliance mechanism is designed to strengthen the Protocol’s environmental integrity, support the carbon market’s credibility and ensure transparency of accounting by Parties.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">One of the unique features of the Rock pythons of India is that they can raise their body temperature above the ambient level, through muscular contractions. Rock python of India is an endangered species. The reason for this is that it is killed for its fine skin, meat and even for medicinal purposes.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>23.2.3. Non-Compliance of Kyoto And Penalties</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Like most things in life, failure to comply with the Protocol carries penalties.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> If a country does not meet the requirements for measurements and reporting said country looses the privilege of gaining credit through joint implementation projects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> If a country goes above its emissions cap, and does not try to make up the difference through any of the mechanisms available, then said country must make up the difference plus an additional thirty percent during the next period.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The country could also be banned from participating in the ‘cap and trade’ program.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>23.3. BALI MEET:</span></h2></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Bali Meet was the meeting of 190 countries that are party to a UN treaty on climate change held in December 2007.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Objectives:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The treaty’s aim was to push the world towards taking action that reduces the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which cause climate change.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Bali was to discuss what happens after 2012—what are countries expected to do after the first phase of Kyoto ends in 2012.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> As per developed countries, after 2012, even the developing countries like India and China, which are increasing their emissions as they grow economically, also undertake some kind of emission cuts. This meant a complete overhaul of the existing UN treaty.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In Bali, the nations have decided upon a new set of principles that will, help the countries decide a post-2012 deal.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>23.3.1. Bali Roadmap</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The participating nations adopted the Bali Road Map as a two-year process to finalizing a binding agreement in 2009 in Copenhagen.</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Conference of Parties decided to launch a comprehensive process to enable the implementation of the Convention through long-term cooperative action up to and beyond 2012, by addressing:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Russell’s Viper is responsible for the more deaths due to snakebite than any other venomous snake. It is highly irritable and when threatened, coils tightly, hisses, and strikes with a lightning speed. Its hemotoxic venom is a very potent coagulant, which damages tissue as well as blood cells.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A legally binding agreement could not be arrived n CoP 15, Copenhagen mainly due to discord between developing and developed nations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The summit concluded with the CoP taking a note of Copenhagen Accord ( a five nation accord- BASIC and US).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Copenhagen Accord is a non-binding agreement.</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Objectives of the Paris Agreement</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> To hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre industrial levels and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> To pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Agreement also talks about reaching the global peaking of emissions by the second half of the century, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country Parties.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Nationally determined contributions</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. This includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In 2018, Parties will take stock of the collective efforts in relation to progress towards the goal set in the Paris Agreement and to inform the preparation of NDCs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">There will also be a global stock take every 5 years to assess the collective progress towards achieving the purpose of the Agreement and to inform further individual actions by Parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016. The first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1) took place in Marrakech, Morocco from 15-18 November 2016.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">By the close of the Marrakech conference, it had been ratified by 111 countries representing more than three-fourths of global emissions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The agreement defines parties’ basic obligations and establishes new procedures and mechanisms. But for these to be fully operational, their details must be further elaborated. This requires the adoption by parties of an extensive set of decisions known loosely as the “Paris rulebook.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>23.11 MARRAKECH CLIMATE CHANGE</span><br><br><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>CONFERENCE -COP22, 2016</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Beyond developing the Paris rulebook, parties took actions and made announcements on a range of other issues, including:</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Finance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Paris Agreement requires developed countries to provide biennial reports on financial support provided or mobilized through “public interventions,” and on projected levels of future support. In Marrakech, SBSTA began considering how to account for public finance. Issues include whether the accounting should apply only to flows from</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">developed to developing countries or to broader flows of public finance.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Global Stocktake</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In Marrakech, parties began discussing how to structure the stocktake, including its format, inputs, timeline, duration, and output, and its linkage to other elements of the Paris architecture.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>“Orphan” issues</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">One of the most contentious items in Marrakech was how to treat a set of so-called orphan issues that are referenced in the Paris Agreement but not assigned to the APA or another body for further consideration. These issues include whether to establish common timeframes for NDCs (parties adopted different timeframes in the first round); any rules around the adjustment by parties of their NDCs; and the development of a new collective finance goal beyond 2025. Unable to agree on any specific direction, parties simply asked the APA to continue its consideration of “possible additional matters relating to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Adaptation Fund</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">One holdover issue from Paris was whether the Adaptation Fund established under the Kyoto Protocol, which provides adaptation support to developing countries, would continue under the Paris Agreement. Although developed countries would prefer to channel support through the newly establish Green Climate Fund, developing countries pushed very hard to keep the Adaptation Fund alive. Parties decided the fund “should serve the Paris Agreement,” pending decisions on governance and other issues.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>2018 Facilitative Dialogue</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In Paris, anticipating that the Paris Agreement would not be in force for several years, parties decided to conduct an early stocktake through a “facilitative dialogue” in 2018. (The next round of NDCs is due in 2019/20.) In Marrakech, parties asked the presidencies of COP 22 and COP 23 to jointly undertake consultations on how to organize the facilitative dialogue, and to report back at COP 23.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Mid-century Strategies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Paris Agreement encourages countries to prepare and submit “long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies” outlining the kinds of actions needed to achieve much deeper emission reductions. In Marrakech, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the United States became the first countries to submit what have come to be known as mid-century strategies. A new initiative called the 2050 Pathway Platform was launched, with support from a broad array of national governments, cities, states, and companies, to help other countries develop their own midcentury strategies.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Finance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Heading into Marrakech, developed countries released a roadmap outlining how they foresee meeting the goal of mobilizing $100 billion a year in public and private finance for developing countries by 2020. In Marrakech, the UNF-CCC’s Standing Committee on Finance released its second biennial assessment, showing that total global climate finance increased 15 percent in 2013-14, reaching a high-bound estimate of $741 billion in 2014.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Countries and others announced a variety of new financial pledges, including:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">$23 million for the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), which provides technical assistance and capacity building for developing countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">More than $50 million for the Capacity-building Initiative for Transparency established in Paris to help developing countries build the capacity to meet new transparency requirements; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">A doubling of World Bank climate finance for the Middle East-North Africa region to $1.5 billion by 2020.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Loss and Damage</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Parties conducted the first review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM). The mechanism, established as an interim body at COP 19 and subsequently brought under the Paris Agreement, is charged with developing approaches to help vulnerable countries cope with unavoidable climate impacts, including extreme weather events and slow-onset events such as sea-level rise. The next review will take place in 2019, and further reviews will be conducted on a five-year cycle, which could align with the global stocktakes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Alliance declares that the coal phase-out is required in the OECD and EU28 by 2030, and no later than by 2050 in the rest of the world” to meet the Paris Agreement. But it does not commit signatories to any particular phase-out date. It also does not commit the signatories to end the financing of unabated coal power stations, rather just restricting it.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Talanoa Dialogue</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">“Talanoa is a traditional word used in Fiji and across the Pacific to reflect a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Talanoa Dialogue is a process designed to help countries implement and enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions by 2020. The process of Talanoa involves the sharing of ideas, skills,and experience through storytelling. It will be structured around three questions - Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? Originally called the facilitative dialogue, the name was changed to Talanoa dialogue in Bonn UNFCCC meeting under the Fijian COP presidency.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Special Climate Change Fund (Sccf)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) was established under the Convention in 2001 to finance projects relating to: adaptation; technology transfer and capacity building; energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management; and economic diversification.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Global Environment Facility (GEF), as an operating entity of the financial mechanism, has been entrusted to operate the SCCF.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">2. Finance Mechanism for Climate Change</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Financial resources that have been made available to Non-Annex I Parties to the UNFCCC consist of the following three modules:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> The “National Communications Module”: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">This module presents information communicated by Annex II Parties on the provision of financial resources related to the implementation of the Convention through their fourth and fifth national communications.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Fast-Start Finance</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> During the Conference of the Parties (COP15) held in December 2009 in Copenhagen developed countries pledged to provide new and additional resources, including forestry and investments, approaching USD 30 billion for the period 2010 - 2012 and with balanced allocation between mitigation and adaptation. This collective commitment has come to be known as ‘fast-start finance’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Following up on this pledge, the Conference of the Parties (COP i6)in Cancun, in December 2010, took note of this collective commitment by developed country Parties and reaffirmed that funding for adaptation will be prioritized for the most vulnerable developing countries, such as the least developed countries, small island developing States and Africa.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> At COP 17 Parties welcomed the fast-start finance provided by developed countries as part of their collective commitment to provide new and additional resources approaching USD 30 billion for the period 2010-2012, and noted the information provided by developed country Parties on the fast-start finance they have provided and urged them to continue to enhance the transparency of their reporting on the fulfillment of their fast-start finance commitments.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) is the global endeavour to create an incentive for developing countries to protect, better manage and save their forest resources, thus contributing to the global fight against climate change</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> REDD+ goes beyond merely checking deforestation and forest degradation, and includes incentives for positive elements of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Will India Benefit from REDD+?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">India’s sustained efforts for conserving and expanding its forest and tree resources have the possibility of being rewarded for providing carbon service to the international community in addition to providing traditional goods and services to the local communities.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The incentives so received from REDD+ would be passed to the local communities involved in protection and management of the forests. This will ensure sustained protection of our forests against deforestation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It is estimated that a REDD+ programme for India could provide capture of more than 1 billion tonnes of additional CO2 over the next 3 decades and provide more than USD 3 billion as carbon service incentives under REDD+.</span></p></li></ul>
