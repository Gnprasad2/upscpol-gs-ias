<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold; color: midnightblue;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>ECOLOGY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">cology ‘Oikos’ meaning home or place to live in and ‘logos’ meaning study. Literally it is the study of the home of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Ecology is defined “as a scientific study of the relationship of the living organisms with each other and with their environment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It deals with the ways in which organisms are moulded by their environment, how they make use of environmental resources including energy flow and mineral cycling.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>1.1. HISTORY OF ECOLOGY</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The roots of ecology lie in Natural History, which is as old as human civilization itself. Since early history, man has indulged in ecology in a practical sort of way, knowingly and unknowingly. In primitive societies every individual was required to have an intimate knowledge of his environment for their survival, i.e., about the forces of nature and of plants and animals around him/her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Our ancient Indian texts have references to ecological principles. The classical texts of the Vedic period such as the Vedas, the Samhitas, the Brahmanas and the Aranyakas-Upanishads contain many references to ecological concepts. The Indian treatise on medicine, the Charaka-Samhita and the surgical text Sushruta-Samhita, show that people during this period had a good understanding of plant and animal ecology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">These texts contain classification of animals on the basis of habit and habitat, land in terms of nature of soil, climate and vegetation; and description of plants typical to various localities. Charaka- Samhita contains information that air, land, water and seasons were indispensable for life and that polluted air and water were injurious to health.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1.2. ENVIRONMENT AND ITS COMPONENT</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Everything that surrounds or affects an organism during its life time is collectively known as its environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The environment is defined as ‘the sum total of living, non-living components; influences and events, surrounding an organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">All organisms (from virus to man) are obligatorily dependent on the other organism and environment for food, energy, water, oxygen, shelter and for other needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The relationship and interaction between organism and environment are highly complex. It comprises both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The environment is not static. Both biotic and abiotic factors are in a flux and keeps changing continuously.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">For instance: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Let’s take the environment of a fish in the pond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">External environment of fish</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Its environment consists of abiotic components such as light, temperature, including the water in which nutrients, oxygen, other gases and organic matter are dissolved.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• The biotic environment consists of microscopic organisms called plankton which it assume as well as aquatic plants, animals and decomposers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Internal environment of fish</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• It is enclosed by the outer body surface.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• The internal environment is relatively stable as compared to the external environment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• However, it is not absolutely constant. Injury, illness or excessive stress upsets the internal environment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• For example, if a marine fish is transferred to a fresh water environment, it will not be able to survive.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1.3 LEVELS OF ORGANISATIONS IN ECOLOGY</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The main levels of organisation of ecology are six and are as follows.</span></p><img src="index-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:222pt;height:173pt;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1.3.1. Individual</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Organism is an individual living being that has the ability to act or function independently. It may be plant, animal, bacterium, fungi, etc. It is a body made up of organs, organelles, or other parts that work together to carry out on the various processes of life.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>1.3.2. Population</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Population is a group of organisms usually of the same species, occupying a defined area during a specific time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Population growth rate is the percentage variation between the number of individuals in a population at two different times. Therefore the population growth rate can be positive or negative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The main factors that make population increase are birth and immigration. The main factors that make population decrease are death and emigration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The main limiting factors for the growth of a population are abiotic and biotic components.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Population density is the relation between the number of individuals of a population and the area they occupy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>1.3.3. Community</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">If we look around ourself, we will notice that population of plants and animals seldom occur by themselves. The reason for this is quite obvious. In order to survive, individuals of any one species depend on individuals of different species with which they actively interact in several ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For eg: Animals require plants for food and trees for shelter. Plants require animals for pollination, seed dispersal, and soil microorganism to facilitate nutrient supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Communities in most instances are named after the dominant plant form (species).</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For example: A grassland community is dominated by grasses, though it may contain herbs, shrubs, and trees, along with associated animals of different species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">A community is not fixed or rigid; communities may be large or small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The skies over North India are seasonally filled with a thick soup of aerosol particles all along the southern edge of the Himalayas, Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal.- NASA research findings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Types of Community</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">On the basis of size and degree of relative independence communities may be divided into two types:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">(a) Major Community</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">These are large-sized, well organized and relatively independent. They depend only on the sun’s energy from outside and are independent of the inputs and outputs from adjacent communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">E.g: tropical ever green forest in the North-East</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">(b) Minor Communities</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">These are dependent on neighbouring communities and are often called societies. They are secondary aggregations within a major community and are not therefore completely independent units as far as energy and nutrient dynamics are concerned, e.g: A mat of lichen on a cow dung pad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Structure of a community</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In a community the number of species and size of their population vary greatly. A community may have one or several species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The environmental factors determine the characteristic of the community as well as the pattern of organisation of the members in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The characteristic pattern of the community is termed as structure which is reflected in the roles played by various population, their range, the type of area they inhabit, the diversity of species in the community and the spectrum of interactions between them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1.3.4. Ecosystem</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">An ecosystem is defined as a structural and functional unit of biosphere consisting of community of living beings and the physical environment, both interacting and exchanging materials between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It includes plants, trees, animals, fish, birds, micro-organisms, water, soil, and people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Ecosystems vary greatly in size and elements but each is a functioning unit of nature. Everything that lives in an ecosystem is dependent on the other species and elements that are also part of that ecological community. If one part of an ecosystem is damaged or disappears, it has an impact on everything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">When an ecosystem is healthy (i.e. sustainable) it means that all the elements live in balance and are capable of reproducing themselves. Ecosystem can be as small as a single tree or as large as entire forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Difference between ecology, environment and ecosystem</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For example, let us take Shankar IAS Academy and its students. Let’s say that ecology would be the scientific study of student’s relationship with the Shankar IAS Academy as a whole. The Shankar IAS Academy being the environment in which the student studies, and the set of circumstances surrounding the student in which environment would be the teachers, books, other students, etc are said to be ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Components of Ecosystem</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">the components of ecosystem and environment are same.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Abiotic Components</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Abiotic components are the inorganic and non-living parts of the world. The abiotic part consists of soil, water, air, and light energy etc. It also involves chemicals like oxygen, nitrogen etc. and physical processes including volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, forest fires, climates, and weather conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Abiotic factors are the most important determinants of where and how well an organism exists in its environment. Although these factors interact with each other, one single factor can limit the range of an organism.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a) Energy</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Energy from the sun is essential for maintenance of life. In the case of plants, the sun directly supplies the necessary energy. Since animals cannot use solar energy directly they obtain it indirectly by eating plants or animals or both. Energy determines the distribution of organisms in the environment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">b) Rainfall</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Water is essential for all living beings. Majority of biochemical reactions take place in an aqueous medium. Water helps to regulate body temperature. Further, water bodies form the habitat for many aquatic plants and animals.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">c) Temperature</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Temperature is a critical factor of the environment which greatly influences survival of organisms. Organisms can tolerate only a certain range of temperature and humidity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">d) Atmosphere</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The earth’s atmosphere is responsible for creating conditions suitable for the existence of a healthy biosphere on this planet.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">e) Substratum</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Land is covered by soil and a wide variety of microbes, protozoa, fungi and small animals (invertebrates) thrive in it. Roots of plants pierce through the soil to absorb water and nutrients. Organisms can be terrestrial or aquatic. Terrestrial animals live on land. Aquatic plants, animals and microbes live in fresh water as well as in the sea. Some microbes live even in hot water vents under the sea.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">f) Materials:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">(i) Organic compound such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, humic substances are formed from inorganic compound on decomposition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">(ii) Inorganic compound such as carbon dioxide, water, sulphur, nitrates, phosphates, and ions of various metals are essential for organisms to survive.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">g) Latitude and altitude</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Latitude has a strong influence on an area’s temperature, resulting in change of climates such as polar, tropical, and temperate. These climates determine different natural biomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">From sea level to highest peaks, wild life is influenced by altitude. As the altitude increases, the air becomes colder and drier, affecting wild life accordingly.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">2. Biotic Components</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Biotic components include living organisms comprising plants, animals and microbes and are classified according to their functional attributes into producers and consumers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a) Primary producers - Autotrophs (selfnourishing)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Primary producers are basically green plants (and certain bacteria and algae).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• They synthesise carbohydrate from simple inorganic raw materials like carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight by the process of photosynthesis for themselves, and supply indirectly to other nonproducers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• In terrestrial ecosystem, producers are basically herbaceous and woody plants, while in aquatic ecosystem producers are various species of microscopic algae.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">b) Consumers - Heterotrophs or phagotrophs (other nourishing)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Consumers are incapable of producing their own food (photosynthesis).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• They depend on organic food derived from plants, animals or both.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Consumers can be divided into two broad groups namely micro and macro consumers.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">(i) Macro consumers</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• They feed on plants or animals or both and are categorised on the basis of their food sources.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Herbivores are primary consumers which feed mainly on plants e.g. cow, rabbit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Secondary consumers feed on primary consumers e.g. wolves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Carnivores which feed on secondary consumers are called tertiary consumers e.g. lions which can eat wolves.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Omnivores are organisms which consume both plants and animals e.g. man, monkey.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">(ii) Micro consumers - Saprotrophs (decomposers or osmotrophs)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• They are bacteria and fungi which obtain energy and nutrients by decomposing dead organic substances (detritus) of plant and animal origin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• The products of decomposition such as inorganic nutrients which are released in the ecosystem are reused by producers and thus recycled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Earthworm and certain soil organisms (such as nematodes, and arthropods) are detritus feeders and help in the decomposition of organic matter and are called det-rivores.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The detailed study of ecosystem will be dealt in the subsequent chapters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Ecosystems are capable of maintaining their state of equilibrium. They can regulate their own species structure and functional processes. This capacity of ecosystem of self regulation is known as </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">homeostasis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Goods and Services provided by ecosystems include:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Provision of food, fuel and fibre</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Provision of shelter and building materials</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Purification of air and water</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Detoxification and decomposition of wastes</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Stabilization and moderation of the Earth’s climate</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Moderation of floods, droughts, temperature extremes and the forces of wind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Generation and renewal of soil fertility, including nutrient cycling.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Pollination of plants, including many crops Control of pests and diseases</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Maintenance of genetic resources as key inputs to crop varieties and livestock breeds, medicines, and other products</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Cultural and aesthetic benefits</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Ecotone</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Ecotone is a zone of junction between two or more diverse ecosystems. For e.g. the mangrove forests represent an ecotone between marine and terrestrial ecosystem. Other examples are - grassland, estuary and river bank</span></p><img src="index-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:221pt;height:161pt;">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Ecotone</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Characteristics of Ecotone</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• It may be very narrow or quite wide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• It has the conditions intermediate to the adjacent ecosystems. Hence it is a zone of tension.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• It is linear as it shows progressive increase in species composition of one in coming community and a simultaneous decrease in species of the other out going adjoining community.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• A well developed ecotones contain some organisms which are entirely different from that of the adjoining communities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">• Sometimes the number of species and the population density of some of the species is much greater in this zone than either community. This is called edge effect.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The organisms which occur primarily or most abundantly in this zone are known as edge species. In the terrestrial ecosystems edge effect is especially applicable to birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For example the density of birds is greater in the mixed habitat of the ecotone between the forest and the desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Niche</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">A niche is the unique functional role or place of a species in an ecosystem. It is a description of all the biological, physical and chemical factors that a species needs to survive, stay healthy and reproduce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">A niche is unique for a species, which means no two species have exact identical niches. Niche plays an important role in conservation of organisms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">If we have to conserve species in its native habitat we should have knowledge about the niche requirements of the species and should ensure that all requirements of its niche are fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Types of Niche</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Habitat niche - where it lives</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Food niche - what is eats or decomposes &amp;&nbsp;what species it competes with</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. Reproductive niche - how and when it reproduces.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">4. Physical &amp;&nbsp;chemical niche - temperature, land shape, land slope, humidity &amp;&nbsp;other requirement.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Two Schemes namely Nagar VanaUdyanYojana and School Nursery Yojana have been launched. Nagar VanaUdyanYojana aims to create at least one city forest in each city with a minimum area of 25 ha. The scheme aims at creation of a City Forest in forest areas within their jurisdiction up to a maximum of 100 ha and minimum area of 20 ha. The objective of the Yojana is to create 200 City Forests in the country. The School Nursery Yojana aims to build a lasting bond of students with nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1.3.5. Biome</span></p><img src="index-8.jpg" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:132pt;">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">BIOME Distribution based on Temperature and Precipitation</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The terrestrial part of the biosphere is divisible into enormous regions called biomes, which are characterized, by climate, vegetation, animal life and general soil type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">No two biomes are alike. The climate determines the boundaries of a biome and abundance of plants and animals found in each one of them. The most important climatic factors are temperature and precipitation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Aquatic systems are not called biomes, however they are divided into distinct life zones, with regions of relatively distinct plant and animal life. The major differences between the various aquatic zones are due to salinity, levels of dissolved nutrients, water temperature, depth of sunlight penetration.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>1.3.6. Biosphere</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Biosphere is a part of the earth where life can exist. Biosphere represents a highly integrated and interacting zone comprising of atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (water) and lithosphere (land).</span></p><img src="index-9.jpg" alt="" style="width:170pt;height:183pt;">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It is a narrow layer around the surface of the earth. If we visualise the earth to be the size of an apple the biosphere would be as thick as its skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Life in the biosphere is abundant between 200 metres (660 feet) below the surface of the ocean and about 6,000 metres (20,000 feet) above sea level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Biosphere is absent at extremes of the North and South poles, the highest mountains and the deepest oceans, since existing hostile conditions there do not support life. Occasionally spores of fungi and bacteria do occur at great height beyond 8,000 metres, but they are not metabolically active, and hence represent only dormant life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The energy required for the life within the biosphere comes from the sun. The nutrients necessary for living organisms come from air, water and soil. The same chemicals are recycled over and over again for life to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Living organisms are not uniformly distributed throughout the biosphere. Only a few organisms live in the polar regions, while the tropical rain forests have an exceedingly rich diversity of plants and animals (50% of Global Biodiversity).</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Environmental Information System (ENVIS), a Central Sector Scheme of the Ministry has been implemented since 1982. The purpose of the scheme is to integrate country-wide efforts in environmental information collection, collation, storage, retrieval and dissemination through ENVIS websites, which are dedicated to different interesting themes.</span></p>
