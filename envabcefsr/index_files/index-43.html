<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>28.12 THE STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON POP</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was adopted at a Conference of Plenipotentiaries on 22 May 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden and entered into force on 17 May 2004,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">POPs</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are organic chemical substances, that is, they are carbon-based. They possess a particular combination of physical and chemical properties such that, once released into the environment, they:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> remain intact for exceptionally long periods of time (many years);</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> become widely distributed throughout the environment as a result of natural processes involving soil, water and, most notably, air;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms including humans, and are found at higher concentrations at higher levels in the food chain; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> are toxic to both humans and wildlife.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In addition, POPs concentrate in living organisms through another process called bioaccumulation. Though not soluble in water, POPs are readily absorbed in fatty tissue, where concentrations can become magnified by up to 70,000 times the background levels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The 12 initial POPs</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Initially, twelve POPs have been recognized as causing adverse effects on humans and the ecosystem and these can be placed in 3 categories:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Pesticides: aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, toxaphene;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Industrial chemicals: hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. By-products: hexachlorobenzene; polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF), and PCBs.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The new POPs under the Stockholm Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Nine new POPs</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">At its fourth meeting held in 2009, the CoP adopted amendments to Annexes A, B and C to the Stockholm Convention to list nine new persistent organic pollutants.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Pesticides: chlordecone, alpha hexachloro- cyclohexane, beta hexachlorocyclohexane, lindane, pentachlorobenzene;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Industrial chemicals: hexabromobiphenyl, hexabromodiphenyl ether and heptabro -modiphenyl ether, pentachlorobenzene, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride, tetrabromodiphenyl ether and pentabromodiphenyl ether; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. By-products: alpha hexachlorocyclohexane, beta hexachlorocyclohexane and pentachlorobenzene.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Endosulfan</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">At its fifth meeting held in 2011, the CoP adopted an amendment to Annex A to the Stockholm Convention to list technical endosulfan and its related isomers with a specific exemption.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Basel, Switzerland, in response to a public outcry following the discovery, in the 1980s, in Africa and other parts of the developing world of deposits of toxic wastes imported from abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Objective</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">To protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. Its scope of application covers a wide range of wastes defined as “hazardous wastes” based on their origin and/or composition and their characteristics, as well as two types of wastes defined as “other wastes” - household waste and incinerator ash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Principal aims:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The reduction of hazardous waste generation and the promotion of environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, wherever the place of disposal;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> the restriction of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes except where it is perceived to be in accordance with the principles of environmentally sound management; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> a regulatory system applying to cases where transboundary movements are permissible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Waste under the Basel Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Wastes are substances or objects which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Annex</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Annex I of the Convention, as further clarified in Annexes VIII and IX, lists those wastes that are classified as hazardous and subject to the control procedures under the Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Annex II of the Convention identifies those wastes that require special consideration (known as “other wastes”, and which primarily refer to household wastes).</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Convention creates legally binding obligations for the implementation of the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure. It built on the voluntary PIC procedure, initiated by UNEP and FAO in 1989 and ceased on 24 February 2006.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Convention covers pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons by Parties and which have been notified by Parties for inclusion in the PIC procedure.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Objectives:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> to contribute to the environmentally sound use of those hazardous chemicals, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Annex III Chemicals</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The chemicals listed in Annex III include pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons by two or more Parties and which the Conference of the Parties has decided to subject to the PIC procedure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> There are a total of 43 chemicals listed in Annex III, 32 are pesticides (including 4 severely hazardous pesticide formulations) and 11 industrial chemicals.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">One notification from each of two specified regions triggers consideration of addition of a chemical to Annex III of the Convention. Severely hazardous pesticide formulations that present a risk under conditions of use in developing countries or countries with economies in transition may also be proposed for inclusion in Annex III.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Established in 1994, UNCCD is the sole legally binding international agreement linking environment and development to sustainable land management.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The UNCCD is particularly committed to a bottom-up approach, encouraging the participation of local people in combating desertification and land degradation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is one of the Rio Conventions that focuses on desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> ‘Desertification’ as defined in the UNCCD refers to land degradation in the drylands (arid, semi arid and dry sub humid regions) resulting from various factors and does not connote spread or expansion of deserts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> UNCCD with 194 Parties is a unique instrument that recognises land degradation as an important factor affecting some of the most vulnerable people and ecosystems in the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The convention aims at adaption and can, on implementation, significantly contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as well as sustainable development and poverty reduction by means of arresting and reversing land degradation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The convention promotes sustainable land management (SLM) as solution to global challenges. Land degradation is long-term loss of ecosystem function and productivity caused by disturbances from which the land cannot recover unaided. While Sustainable Land Management is focused on changes in land cover/land use in order to maintain and enhance ecosystems functions and services.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In the Koraput system, women have played a key role in the conservation of biodiversity. The Kuttanad system was developed by farmers over 150 years ago to ensure their food security by learning to cultivate rice and other crops below sea level. The Kuttanad System is now attracting worldwide attention since one of the effects of global warming is sea level rise. It has therefore been an act of vision on the part of Kerala government to have decided to set up an International Research and Training Centre for Below Sea Level Farming in Kuttanad.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>28.20. MINAMATA CONVENTION</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Minamata Convention on Mercury is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. It was adopted in 2013 in Kumamoto, Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It also controls the trans-boundary movement of mercury. It does not include natural emissions of mercury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Mercury is considered to be one of the most toxic metals known. Once released into the environment, mercury bioaccumulates and bio-magnifies up in the food chain, and easily enters the human body and impacts the nervous system.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Minamata Convention requires that party nations:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Reduce and where feasible eliminate the use and release of mercury from artisanal and small-scale gold mining.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Control mercury air emissions from coal-fired power plants, coal-fired industrial boilers, certain non-ferrous metals production operations, waste incineration,and cement production.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Phase-out or take measures to reduce mercury use in certain products such as batteries, switches, lights, cosmetics, pesticides and measuring devices, and create initiatives to reduce the use of mercury in dental amalgam.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Phase out or reduce the use of mercury in manufacturing processes such as chlor-alkali production, vinyl chloride monomer production, and acetaldehyde production.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In addition, the Convention addresses the supply and trade of mercury; safer storage and disposal, and strategies to address contaminated sites.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Convention includes provisions for technical assistance, information exchange, public awareness, and research and monitoring. It also requires Parties to report on measures taken to implement certain provisions. The Convention will be periodically evaluated to assess its effectiveness in meeting its objective of protecting human health and the environment from mercury pollution.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Minamata Convention entered into force on August 2017. The first CoP to the Minamata Convention on Mercury (COP1) took place in September 2017 at the International Conference Centre in Geneva. The COP 2 will take place in November 2018 in Geneva, Switzerland</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Union Cabinet has approved the proposal for ratification of Minamata Convention on Mercury along with flexibility for continued use of mercury-based products and processes involving mercury compound up to 2025 and depositing the instrument of ratification enabling India to become a Party of the Convention.</span></p>
