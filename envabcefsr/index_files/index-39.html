<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>25.15 PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT RULES, 2016</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">15, 000 tonnes of plastic waste is generated every day, out of which 9, 000 tonnes is collected and processed, but 6, 000 tonnes of plastic waste is not being collected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">An eco-friendly product, which is a complete substitute of the plastic in all uses, has not been found till date. In the absence of a suitable alternative, it is impractical and undesirable to impose a blanket ban on the use of plastic all over the country. The real challenge is to improve plastic waste management systems.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Salient features</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Increase minimum thickness of plastic carry bags from 40 to 50 microns and stipulate minimum thickness of 50 micron for plastic sheets also to facilitate collection and recycle of plastic waste.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. To promote use of plastic waste for road construction as per Indian Road Congress guidelines or energy recovery, or waste to oil etc. for gainful utilization of waste</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. Rural areas have been brought in ambit of these Rules since plastic has reached torural areas also. Responsibility for implementation of the rules is given to Gram Panchayat.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">4. First time, responsibility of waste generators is being introduced. Individual and bulk generators like offices, commercial establishments, industries are to segregate the plastic waste at source, handover segregated waste, pay user fee as per bye-laws of the local bodies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">5. Plastic products are left littered after the public events (marriage functions, religious gatherings, public meetings etc) held in open spaces. First time, persons organizing such events have been made responsible for management of waste generated from these events.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">6. Use of plastic sheet for packaging, wrapping the commodity except those plastic sheet’s thickness, which will impair the functionality of the product are brought under the ambit of these rules. A large number of commodities are being packed/wrapped into plastic sheets and thereafter such sheets are left for littered. Provisions have been introduced to ensure their collection and channelization to authorised recycling facilities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">7. Extended Producer Responsibility: Earlier, EPR was left to the discretion of the local bodies. First time, the producers and brand owners have been made responsible for collecting waste generated from their products. They have to approach local bodies for formulation of plan/system for the plastic waste management within the prescribed time frame.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">8. SPCBs will not grant/renew registration of plastic bags, or multi-layered packaging unless the producer proposes the action plan endorsed by the concerned State Development Department.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">9. Producers to keep a record of their vendors to whom they have supplied raw materials for manufacturing carry bags, plastic sheets, and multi-layered packaging. This is to curb manufacturing of these products in unorganised sector.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">10. The entry points of plastic bags/plastic sheets/multi-layered packaging in to commodity supply chain are primarily the retailers and street vendors. They have been assigned the responsibility of not to provide the commodities in plastic bags/plastic sheets/multi-lay-ered packaging which do not conform to these rules. Otherwise, they will have to pay the fine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">11. Plastic carry bag will be available only with shopkeep-ers/street vendors pre-registered with local bodies on payment of certain registration fee. The amount collected as registration fee by local bodies is to be used for waste management.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">12. CPCB has been mandated to formulate the guidelines for thermoset plastic (plastic difficult to recycle). In the earlier Rules, there was no specific provision for such type of plastic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">13. Manufacturing and use of non-recyclable multi-layered plastic to be phased in two years.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Amendment Rules, 2018</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Phasing out of Multilayered Plastic (MLP) is now applicable to MLP, which are non-recyclable, or nonenergy recoverable, or with no alternative use.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A national registry has been prescribed for producers with a presence in more than two states, a state-level registration has been prescribed for smaller producers/ brand owners operating within one or two states.</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>25.16 WETLANDS (CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT) RULES 2017</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 supersede the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010 for effective conservation and management of wetlands in the country</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Key features</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Decentralisation of wetland management. Under the new rules, the powers have been given to the State governments so that protection and conservation can be done at the local level. The central government has mainly retained powers regarding monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The new rules have replaced the Central Wetlands Regulatory Authority (CWRA) with the National Wetland Committee, which has a merely advisory role.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The State or UT Wetlands Authority will have to prepare a list of all wetlands and also will develop a comprehensive list of activities to be regulated and permitted within notified wetlands and their zone of influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The new rules also prohibit encroachments on wetlands, solid waste dumping, discharge of untreated waste and effluents from industries and human settlements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It prescribes that conservation and management would be based on the principle of wise use, which is to be determined by the Wetlands Authority.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Shortfalls</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">We have earlier read the definition of wetland given by Ramsar convention earlier in this topic. The 2010 wetland rules followed the definition of Ramsar convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">However, the 2017 rules, in the definition of wetland do not include river channels, paddy fields, man-made water bod-ies/tanks specifically for drinking water purposes and structures specifically constructed for aquaculture, salt production, recreation, and irrigation purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">By this new definition (exclusion of aforesaid wetlands) close to 65 % wetland in the country will lose the status of wetlands. The management and protection awarded to river channels, man-made wetlands will be no more effective as they are not considered wetlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The definition of wetlands and its inclusion is done by the respective state/ UT. This may lead to a lack of uniformity in defining and conserving the wetlands in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The older provision of appealing to the National Green Tribunal does not exist in the 2017 Rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">There is also no timeline specified for phasing out solid waste and untreated waste from being dumped into wetlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The new rules do not take into account the Jagpal Singh vs State of Punjab (2011) judgment of Supreme Court for the restoration of encroached wetlands throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Key to wetland conservation is not just understanding regimes of multiple uses but conserving and managing the integrity of the wetland ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">• </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Gujarat has the largest area of wetland in the country. Lakshadweep has the highest percentage of wetland in its own geographical area for a state / UT.</span></p></li></ul>
