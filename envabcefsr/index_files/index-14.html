INDIAN HIMALAYAN REGION</span><br><br><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>(IHR) — ENVIRONMENTAL</span><br><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CHALLENGES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), which occupies a strategic position along the entire northern and northeastern boundary of the country and administratively covers 10 states in their entirety (Jammu &amp;&nbsp;Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya) and two states partially (the hill districts of Assam and West Bengal), has wide ranging ecological and socio-economic significance.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>IHR Services</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Besides innumerable goods, IHR generates a plethora of services not only for Himalayan inhabitants but also influences the lives of people living well beyond its boundaries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Among other services, the region, with its large area under permanent snow cover and glaciers, forms a unique water reservoir that feeds several important perennial rivers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> With its vast green cover, IHR also acts as a giant carbon ‘sink’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> IHR also forms a considerably large part of identified Himalayan Biodiversity global hotspot.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Role in Indian climate.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The region, however, is facing environmental problems on account of various factors including the stress caused by anthropogenic activities. Even geologically, the Himalayan ecosystem falls under the most vulnerable category. Therefore the environmental issues being faced by the IHR are of critical importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Managing the Himalayan ecosystem sustainably is critical not only for preserving its pristine beauty and spectacular landscapes, but also for ensuring the ecological security of the entire Indian sub-continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">(A) URBANIZATION IN THE HIMALAYAS - IS IT SUSTAINABLE?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>IMPACT - SOLID WASTE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The continued expansion in urban settlements, influx of visitors, trekkers and mountaineers in the Himalayan region has started to pose high biotic pressure and concomitant indiscriminate solid waste dumping. As a result, the IHR is getting adversely affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In the absence of proper management practices and inadequate infrastructural facilities, human induced pollution, such as solid waste, untreated sewage and local air pollution due to vehicles has been continuously increasing in the IHR.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>IMPACT - TOWN PLANNING</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Rapid unplanned growth of hill towns, construction activities without a proper plan, general non-compliance with prescribed norms and guidelines, and indiscriminate use of land for commercial outfits/tourist resorts have severely and adversely affected the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Large scale land instabilities, drying up of natural water sources, waste disposal problems and changing sociocultural values are known impacts of unplanned construction activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Deforestation activities - cutting in an area causes ecological damage and slope instability in adjacent areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">INITIATIVES</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Ban on Plastic in HP</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> State government enacted the Himachal Pradesh Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 1995 in order to prevent throwing or depositing non- biodegradable garbage in public drains, roads.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It has then increased the minimum thickness of plastic carry bags to 70 microns of virgin material, which exceeded the 20 micron thickness recommended by Central Rules.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Further, the state Government has taken a Cabinet decision to ban plastics altogether in the entire state since 2009.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Participatory Conservation of Lakes in the Region</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Naini Lake is the sole source of drinking water for Nainital town, an important tourist destination in Uttarakhand state.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Increasing inflow of tourists, urban waste making its way into the lake is adversely affecting water quality.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> To conserve the water body, the residents have switched on to a scientific garbage disposal system - under the project name ‘Mission Butterfly’ by Nainital Lake Conservation Project.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The sweepers, on a small monthly charge, collect waste from each household and directly transfer it to the compost pits. Apart from the residents, schools and hotel owners have extended full cooperation to the authorities, to save its precious eco-system.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In addition, they are able to generate income and employment by converting it to manure.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Conservation of Dal lake</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Dal Lake a favorite tourist destination attracting thousands of tourists in Jammu &amp;&nbsp;Kashmir state, is also special for settlement of about 60,000 people within the lake.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The lake is in peril due to anthropogenic pressure and overall deterioration of surrounding environment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The lake has been included in the lake conservation programme of the MoEF, GOI.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Lake and Waterways Development Authority (LAWDA), Srinagar, in collaboration with Centre for Environment Education (CEE) and other NGOs has taken up the initiative for lake conservation through education and mass awareness. Use of polythene carry bags has also been banned in the lake area.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Assam Hill Land and Ecological Sites Act, 2006</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Assam Hill Land and Ecological Sites (Protection and Management) Act, 2006 to prevent indiscriminate cutting of hills and filling up of water bodies in urban areas, which had led to serious ecological problems in places like Guwahati.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Under the Act, the state government can bring any hill under its purview for protection.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Urban Development through JNNURM</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> “The aim is to encourage reforms and fast track planned development of identified cities. Focus is to be on efficiency in urban infrastructure and service delivery mechanisms, community participation, and accountability of ULBs/ Parastatal agencies towards citizens”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The duration of the mission is seven years starting from 2005-06with initially 13 towns.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Recommendations / solutions for Solid Waste Management in IHR</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The “development” in the present context has become unsustainable. An integrated approach is, therefore, necessary to protect the environment and achieve required economic development at the same time. Advance planning based on timely and reliable data has become crucial for sustainable growth of hill towns.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Guidelines prohibiting indiscriminate disposal of garbage, particularly the non-degradable waste.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Preventive and management steps for solid waste management at the point of origin itself.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. Documentation about the varying composition of waste from the hill towns to expedition tops.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">4. Promotion of techniques such as conversion of biodegradable waste into biocompost, or vermicompost in place of land filling, open dumping or burning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">5. The four 'R’s principle’ - Refuse waste prone commodities, Reuse discarded commodities for other uses, Reduce through segregation into categories—biodegradable and non-biodegradable at household/ individual level, and Re-cycling once fully used or completely unusable commodities/items.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">6. Good quality potable water, available at various locations in hill towns so that people can fill their bottles, on payment basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">7. Awareness and capacity building of the stakeholders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">8. Best international experiences &amp;&nbsp;practices followed in regard to preservation of surroundings and prevention of littering in eco-sensitive places, [e.g., Alaska, Gan-gotri/Leh region, Nepal and China] should be examined and appropriately adopted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">9. Need support and innovative thinking on different aspects, ranging from traditional architectural practices, local water management and diverse systems of sewage and garbage management.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">10. There is a need to motivate residents to switch over to a more scientific waste disposal system in a participatory manner.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Recommendations / solutions - Hill Town Planning and Architectural Norms</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Fragmentation of habitats in hill areas should be prevented.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Specific areas for rural/urban development should be designated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. No construction should be undertaken which fall in hazard zones or areas falling on the spring lines and first order streams.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">4. Architectural and aesthetic norms for construction of buildings in mountain/hill areas should be enforced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">5. Deforestation activities shall not be undertaken unless appropriate measures are taken to avoid such damages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">6. An integrated development plan may be prepared taking into consideration environmental and other relevant factors</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">7. In highly seismic areas like Himalaya, all construction should incorporate earthquake resistant features</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">8. Location-specific technologies should be deployed for construction of buildings</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">9. “Green roads” having channels for collection of water for irrigation purposes should be made a part of the construction norm.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Himalayas is known to be a home of saints, destination of pilgrimage since time immemorial.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> For example, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri- Yamu-notri and Hemkund Sahib in Uttarakhand, Manima-hesh, Jwala Devi, Chintpurni, Naina Devi in Himachal Pradesh and Vaishnav Devi and Amarnath in Jammu &amp;&nbsp;Kashmir, Khecheopalri and other sacred lakes in Sikkim are particularly important destinations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Unfortunately, most of these places lack adequate facilities of transport, accommodation, waste disposal and other amenities for the ever growing number of pilgrims that visit them every year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Also, there is a gross lack of regulatory mechanism for infrastructure creation, management, and for controlling the tourist inflow in such sites.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> As a result the sensitive ecosystems and cultural values of these areas are facing pressures far beyond their carrying capacities.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Impact - of Commercial Tourism</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The impacts of tourism on mountain ecosystems and biological resources are of great concern because of the high biodiversity and environmental sensitivity of the Himalayas.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Cultural identities and diversity in mountain regions are also under threat by the economic, social and environmental forces associated with mountain tourism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In this context, community based ecotourism emerges as one of the sustainable alternatives to the presently practiced commercial tourism in already over saturated hill towns like Nainital, Mussoorrie, Shimla, Kullu-Manali, Gangtok, etc.</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">(ii) Promoting the concept of eco-cultural landscapes (e.g., Demazong - Buddhist landscape, Sikkim, and Apatani eco-cultural landscape, Arunachal Pradesh). Both landscapes are highly evolved with high level of economic and ecological efficiencies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">(iii) Involving them in maintenance and strengthening of sacred groves/landscape (e.g., Sacred Groves of Meghalaya: The tribal communities - Khasis, Garos, and Jaintias, have a tradition of environmental conservation based on religious beliefs and customary law and are protected from any product extraction.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>7.2 SAND MINING IN INDIA -ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Sand is an important mineral for our society in protecting the environment, buffer against strong tidal waves and storm, habitat for crustacean species and marine organisms, used for making concrete, filling roads, building sites, brick making, making glass, sandpapers, reclamations, and in our tourism industry in beach attractions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Sand mining is the process of removal of sand and gravel where this practice is becoming an environmental issue as the demand for sand increases in industry and construction. Despite a Supreme Court order that prohibits sand mining without the requisite clearance from the required authorities and places limits on the quantities that can be mined, thousands of tonnes of sand is being illegally mined to meet the rising demand of construction industry and for extraction of minerals. Let’s discuss about the scenario of sand mining in India</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The environmental reasons for this ban and others across India are numerous. Sand acts as an aquifer, and as a natural carpet on the bottom of the river. Stripping this layer leads to downstream erosion, causing changes in channel bed and habitat type, as well as the deepening of rivers and estuaries, and the enlargement of river mouths. As the river system lowers, local groundwater is affected, which leads to water scarcities aggravating agriculture and local livelihoods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In terms of legal measures, ground water shortages have been noted as the patent problem with river sand mining. Less considered in legal action, but centrally relevant, experts also note substantial habitat and ecological problems, which include “direct loss of stream reserve habitat, disturbances of species attached to streambed deposits, reduced light penetration, reduced primary production, and reduced feeding opportunities”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Economic consequences of sand mining</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Revenue loss to the exchequer</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For e.g.: It is estimated that in Noida and Greater Noida alone the loss to the exchequer is about Rs.1,000 crore, but the impact that sand mining, which is simply put theft on environment and ecology, cannot even be calculated.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Environmental consequences of sand mining</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Forcing the river to change its course</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Sand and boulders prevent the river from changing the course and act as a buffer for the riverbed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Illegally dredged sand is equivalent to robbing water.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Sand holds a lot of water, and when it is mindlessly mined and laden on to trucks, large quantities of water is lost in transit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. Depletion of groundwater tables</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Sand, on a riverbed it acts as a link between the flowing river and the water table and is part of the aquifer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For e.g.: Illegal and excessive sand mining in the riverbed of the Papagani catchment area in Karnataka has led to the depletion of groundwater levels and environmental degradation in the villages on the banks of the river in both Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">4. Adversely impacting the habitat of micro-organisms</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">There are a lot of micro-organisms that are not visible and widely known, but are critical to soil structure and fertility. When sand is dredged, literally it takes away their habitat.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">5. Increased river erosion</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">When sand and boulders are removed in an unimpeded way using heavy machines, the erosion capacity of the river increases.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">6. Damage to roads and bridges</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For e.g.: In Vishnuprayag the boulders that came down with the river water damaged a side of the dam and the waters spread out across causing heavy damage.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">7. Threat to agriculture</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For e.g.: Despite numerous prohibitions and regulations, sand mining continues rapidly on the riverbed of the Bharathapuzha in kerala. Water tables have dropped dramatically and a land once known for its plentiful rice harvest now faces scarcity of water. In the villages and towns around the river, groundwater levels have fallen drastically and wells are almost perennially dry.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">8. Damage to coastal ecosystem</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">This destructive illegal practice in beaches, creeks leads to erosion along the shoreline. Eg: Kihim Beach off Alibaug, Shore levels have reduced, forcing residents to build walls to protect themselves from the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It wrecks the intertidal area and creates the imminent danger of saline water ingress into fresh water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Coastal sand mining destroys fisheries, disturbs coral, mangroves, wetlands and has led to the near extinction of ghariyals, a crocodile species unique to India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">A major impact of beach sand mining is the loss of protection from storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and tsunamis.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">9. Lesser availability of water for industrial, agricultural and drinking purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">10. Loss of employment to farm workers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">11. Threat to livelihoods.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Current rules and policies in operation relation to sand mining</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Kerala: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Kerala Protection of River Banks and Regulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2001</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Key features: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">To permit sand mining in select areas and each selected area or Kadavu will be managed by a Kadavu Committee which will decide on matters such as quantum of mining to be permitted, and to mobilise local people to oversee these operations and ensure protection of rivers and riverbanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Key rivers affected: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Bharatapuzha, Kuttiyadi river, Achankovil, Pampa and Manimala, Periyar, Bhavani, Siru-vani, Thuthapuzha, and Chitturpuzha, rivers in the catchments of Ashtamudi and Vembanad lakes</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Tamil Nadu: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Policy that ensures that quarrying of sand in Government poramboke lands and private patta lands will</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">only be undertaken by the Government. Mechanised sand mining is prohibited. In 2008, this policy was countermanded by the government and private parties were given permits for mining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Rivers affected: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Cauvery, Vaigai, Palar, Cheyyar, Araniyar and Kosathalaiyar, Bhavani, Vellar , Vaigai Thamiraparani, Kollidam. coastal districts of Nagapattinam, Tuticorin, Ramanatha-puram and Kanyakumari. hill regions of Salem and Erode districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Karnataka: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Uniform Sand Mining Policy does not allow sand mining in Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) area and prohibits the use of machineries to mine sand from river. High Court of Karnataka banned mechanised boats for sand mining in the state from April 2011.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">From September 2011, according to Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules 2011,the responsibility of oversight of sand mining has been transferred to the Public Works, Ports and Inland Water Transport Department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Rivers affected: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Cauvery, Lakshmanateerta, Harangi, He-mavathi, Nethravatai, Papagani</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Andhra Pradesh: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In 2006, a new policy that allows only manual labour and bullocks to mine sand in riverbeds. Bullock carts, mules and other animals would be exempted from any mining tax. Contractors will be allotted sand through open bidding by a committee headed by district joint collectors. Sand can be sold only if it has a maximum retail price tag, otherwise there will be a penalty. Use of poclaines has been banned entirely, and mining will be disallowed below three metres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Rivers affected: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Godavari, Tungabhadra, Vamsadhara, Nagavali, Bahuda and Mahendratanaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Maharashtra: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">New policy, 2010, under which it is compulsory for contractors to obtain permission from the Gramsabha, for sand mining. Ban on use of suction pumps in dredging and sand mining licences can be given only through a bidding process. Also sand mining projects have to obtain environmental clearances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Rivers affected: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">creeks at Thane, Navi Mumbai, Raigad and Ratnagiri</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Uttar-Pradesh: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">the Noida administration established a “Special Mining Squad,” charged with the specific task of impeding and ultimately extricating Greater Noida from the sand mafia’s degradation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Rivers affected: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Chhoti Gandak, Gurra, Rapti and Gha-ghara.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Suggestions</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. The most viable alternative is ‘manufactured sand’. It is produced in a stone crushing plant. M-sand is produced from stones which is used for aggregates, and the quality is consistent and even better than river sand. M-sand is relatively cheaper too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Use of fly ash from industries as alternative should be promoted for construction purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. The government should exercise prudence when it comes to leasing out the riverbed for mining activities and also demarcate areas clearly and monitor mining through a suitable institutional mechanism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">4. Periodic assessment of how much sand can be sustainably mined, as the quantity can vary from a river to river and within a river from stretch to stretch has to be done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">5. The use of intrusive techniques such as the use of explosives and heavy excavator machines in sand mining are largely destructive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">6. In the mountain areas especially sand mining should be carried out manually and sustainably.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">7. A high level lobbying committee must be formed and Laws has to be enforced in an efficient and unbiased way and decisive steps are to be taken for environmental solution.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Guidelines for Sustainable Sand &amp;&nbsp;Minor Mineral Mining</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Where to mine and where to prohibit mining: District Survey Report for each district in the country, taking the river in that district as one ecological system. Use of ISRO, remote sensing data and ground truthing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Sustainable mining: Mining out material only that much which is deposited annually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. Involvement of District authorities in the process: The District-level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (DEIAA) headed by District Collector. The District Collector is to be assisted by the District Level Expert Appraisal Committee (DEAC) headed by Executive Engineer (Irrigation Department) being assigned the responsibility of granting environment clearance up to 5 hectare of mine lease area for minor minerals , mainly sand. So district administration, which is the key in assessing the requirement of sand in a district and prohibiting illegal sand mining in district is being involved directly in environmental clearance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">4. Monitoring using scientific tools: Stringent monitoring of movement of mined out material from source to destination using information technology tools, bar coding, SMS etc. Till date, there is no authentic data on how much sand is being mined, this system will generate real-time data on mined out sand. The movement of sand is controlled through Transit Permit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The monitoring of mined out mineral, Environmental Clearance, EC conditions and enforcement of Environment Management Plan (EMP) will be ensured by the District Collector and the State Pollution Control Board. The monitoring of enforcement of EC conditions can be done by the Central Pollution Control Board, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the agency nominated by Ministry for the purpose.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">5. Exemptions: Proposal to exempt certain category from mining for the purpose of environmental clearance, like:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">i. Extraction of ordinary clay or ordinary sand manually by hereditary Kumhars (potters) who prepare earthen pots on a cottage industry basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">ii. Extraction of ordinary clay or ordinary sand manually by earthen tile makers who prepare earthen tiles on a cottage industry basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">iii. Removal of sand deposited on agricultural field after flood by owner farmers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">iv. Customary extraction of sand and ordinary earth from sources situated in Gram Panchayat for personal use or community work in a village.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">v. Community works like desilting of village ponds/ tanks, construction of village/rural roads, bunds undertaken in MGNREGS and other Government-sponsored schemes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">vi. Dredging and desilting of dam, reservoirs, weirs, barrages, river and canals for the purpose of maintenance and upkeep, and the dredged material is used departmentally. If the dredging activities are undertaken for the purpose of winning of mineral and selling it commercially, it will be considered mining and prior EC will be required.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">6. Guideline on handling cluster issues: The original EIA notification does not provide for the procedure to handle cluster situation, which has been proposed in this guideline and will become part of the Notification. One EIA/EMP will be prepared for one cluster irrespective of number and size of mining leases in that cluster, if the area is more than 5 hectares. Area less than 5 hectare will be B2.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>7.3 PALM OIL — ENVIRONMENTAL</span><br><br><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>ISSUES AND INDIA’S ROLE IN IT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">When forest shrink, so does the home of endangered species</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Palm oil has emerged as the main global source of vegetable oil due to adequate availability, versatility in usage, higher yield and lower cost, as compared to other vegetable oils. Palm oil is generally sold in the name of vegetable oil. Palm oil forms 33% of the world vegetable oil production mix. Indonesia and Malaysia contribute almost 87% of production of palm oil, whereas China and India constitute 34% of imports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Global edible oil consumption has grown from 123 Million Metric tonnes in 2007 to 158 Mn MT in 2012. This growth has been fuelled by increased population, incomes and per capita consumption especially in developing countries like India, Indonesia and China, etc. Palm oil, at 48.7 Mn MT is the largest consumed edible oil in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">As demand for palm oil increases, substantial tracts of tropical forests are often cleared to make room for large plantations. As per WWF’s estimates, the expansion of oil palm plantations is likely to cause four million hectares (more than twice the size of Kerala) of forest loss by 2020. Deforestation would most likely occur in high biodiversity areas, such as Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Sumatra and the Congo Basin in Africa. The felling and burning of forests impact populations of endangered wildlife such as Sumatran Tigers, Rhinos and Orangutans. It also has adverse impacts on people’s health and disrupts local livelihoods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">At the global level, the impacts of forest loss are even more dramatic, including the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that contribute to global warming.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1) Food based applications</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Cooking oil, substitute for butter, vanaspati/vegetable ghee, margarine, confectionary and bakery fats, ice cream, coffee creamers, emulsifiers, vitamin E supplements among others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2) Non-food applications</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Cosmetics, toiletries, soaps and detergents. Oleo chemical industry, as a base material for laundry detergents, household cleaners and cosmetics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">According to USDA estimates, 75% of the global palm oil consumption is for food purposes, while 22% is for indus-trial/non-food purposes. The remaining, though currently, of marginal quantity, is used for biodiesel</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PALM OIL PRODUCTION</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">1. Deforestation - Substantial tracts of tropical forests are cleared to make room for large plantations to service an ever increasing demand for palm oil. Studies show that the forest cover on the island of Borneo had declined from 73.7 percent in 1985 to 50.4 percent in 2005, while the projected cover in 2020 was 32.6 percent. Loss of forest cover in Sumatra, Indonesia, has also been very alarming.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">2. Loss of biodiversity - Concerns about biodiversity loss are directly related to the loss of natural forests. In particular, orangutan habitats have been threatened by palm oil production. In 1900, there were around 315,000 orangutans in Indonesia and Malaysia. Today, fewer than 50,000 exist in the wild, split into small groups. The palm oil industry is the biggest threat to orangutans, with the species like to be driven to extinction within 12 years unless the devastation of their natural habitat is halted. A related problem has been that fragmentation of natural forest habitats and encroachment by palm oil development which has been resulted in serious human- wildlife (elephant, etc) conflicts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">3. Climate change - 15% of all human induced greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation, forest degradation and peat land emissions. As land on mineral soil becomes less readily available, the expansion of oil palm is increasing on peat lands. . As these areas are drained, the peat is exposed to oxidation, resulting in significant CO2 release over an extended period. Other significant sources of GHG emissions associated with oil palm are the use of fires for land clearing and the emissions of methane from the effluent treatment ponds of palm oil mills. Forests are felled, peat swamps drained and burnt, creating a haze that covers large areas, affecting people’s health and disrupting economic activities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">4. Use of pesticides and fertilizers - Misuse of pesticides and fertilizers is frequently cited as a negative impact of oil palm cultivation. In general, pesticide use is low compared to many other crops, but some chemicals used, pose significant risks to operators and smallholders and the environment. Among these hazardous chemicals, the herbicide paraquat gives the most cause for concern, as it poses serious health hazards to the spray operators. The Pesticides Action Network-Asia &amp;&nbsp;the Pacific has called for a ban on paraquat production and use on numerous occasions, but to no avail.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Indonesian palm oil companies produce palm oil by destroying virgin rainforests and tiger habitat in Indonesia. Indian huge palm oil imports from Indonesia is been accelerating the destroyal of rainforest. India’s palm oil demand destroying Indonesia’s rainforests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The expansion of palm oil plantations to meet the global demand for vegetable oils (palm oil usually used in this name) happens at the expense of forest, wildlife and communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Consumption of palm oil in India</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Palm oil has dominated Indian imports since the last two decades, for its logistical advantages, contractual flexibility, and consumer acceptance change in consumption patterns, availability, pricing, and policy changes. India is the largest importer of palm oil which is also the lowest priced oil. Palm oil contributes to around 74% (as of 2012) of the total edible oils that are imported into the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Almost 90% of the palm oil imported and produced domestically is used for edible/ food purposes, while the remaining is used for industrial/non-edible purposes. Palm oil is now the single largest consumed vegetable oil in India.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Palm oil in India - Production</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Despite being the world’s fourth largest oilseed producing country, India’s share of palm oil production is small, accounting for 0.2% share in the total world produce</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Palm oil production in India has grown at 22.7% CAGR over the past five years in 2011. However, India would continue to be a net importer of palm oil.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>State-wise Palm Oil Production in India</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Andhra Pradesh is the leading palm oil producing state in India contributing approximately 86 % of country’s production, followed by Kerala (10%) and Karnataka (2%). Other palm oil producing states include Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Gujarat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Major constraints in domestic cultivation of oil palm</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Geographical location: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The ideal locations for oil palm trees are within eight degrees latitude north and south of the Equator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Irrigation: </span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Palms need regular rainfall throughout the year. However, they can withstand dry periods of 3-4 months depending on soils type without irrigation. Oil palm can be grown in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa and a few other areas, but only with irrigation. This places significant pressure on the hydrological system of the region.</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Policies Related to Production and Distribution of Palm Oil</span></h3>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Subsidies for distribution of imported palm oil:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Ministry of Food has been subsiding imported edible oil distribution under the public distribution system (PDS):</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> To provide relief, in particular BPL households, from the rising prices of edible oils, the Central Government introduced a scheme for distribution of upto 10 lakh tons of imported edible oils in 2008-09 at a subsidy of rs 15/- per kg through State Governments/UTs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The scheme was extended during 2009-10, 2010-2011 and in 2011-12. After the implementation of the scheme, edible oil prices have substantially declined and poorer sections were provided edible oils at subsidized rates.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Oil Palm Development Programme in India:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> OPDP was launched during 1991- 92 under the “Technology Mission on Oilseeds and Pulses” (TMOP), with a focus on expansion of area under oil palm cultivation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> From 2004-05, the scheme is being implemented as part of the “Integrated Scheme of Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm &amp;&nbsp;Maize” (ISOPOM) and provides support for oil palm cultivation in 12 states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Tripura &amp;&nbsp;West Bengal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">For the year 2011-12, the government rolled out the Oil Palm Area Expansion (OPAE) Programme in order to bring an additional 60,000 hectares area under oil palm cultivation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The government has also announced various subsidies for oil palm growers for planting, buying pump set and drip-irrigation systems, partial compensation in case of loss during the gestation period and support for processing units.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Roundtable on Sustainable Oil (RSPO)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The RSPO was established in 2004 to promote the production and use of sustainable palm oil for people, planet and prosperity</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold; color:darkorange;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>7.4 . COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER</span></h2></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Bees are one of a myriad of other animals, including birds, bats, beetles, and butterflies, a called pollinators. Pollinators transfer pollen and seeds from one flower to another, fertilizing the plant so it can grow and produce food. Crosspollination helps at least 30 percent of the world’s crops and 90 percent of our wild plants to thrive. Without bees to spread seeds, many plants - including food crops -would die off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Bees are not summertime nuisance, they are small and hard-working insects actually make it possible for many of your favorite foods to reach your table. From apples to almonds to the pumpkin in our pumpkin pies, we have bees to thank. Now, a condition known as Colony Collapse Disorder is causing bee populations to plummet, which means these foods are also at risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a new tagname presently being given to a condition that is characterized by an unexplained rapid loss of a Bee colony’s adult population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Sudden loss of a colony’s worker bee population with very few dead bees found near the colony. The queen and brood (young) remained, and the colonies had relatively abundant honey and pollen reserves. But hives cannot sustain themselves without worker bees and would eventually die. This combination of events resulting in the loss of a bee colony has been called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD).</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Reduction or loss of bee population has been seen in the history and known by the name such as disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Contain no adult bees, with few to no dead bees around the colony</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>CAUSES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The problem is that there doesn’t seem to be a single smoking gun behind CCD but a range of possible causes, including:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Global warming</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Global warming causes flowers to bloom earlier or later than usual. When pollinators come out of hibernation, the flowers that provide the food they need to start to start the season has already bloomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Pesticide (neonicotinoids, a neuroactive chemical)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">It’s not that the pesticides which are aimed at other insects are killing the bees outright. Rather that sublethal exposure of pesticides in nectar and pollen may be interfering with the honeybees internal radar, preventing them from gathering pollen and returning safely to the hive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;">Varroa mite - parasites</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">European foulbrood (A bacterial disease that is increasingly being detected in U.S. bee colonies) microsporidian fungus Nosema.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Malnutrition</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Beekeepers collect (steal) bees honey so humans can consume it, they are taking away the insects’ food. They replace it with high-fructose corn syrup, leaving the bees malnourished and weakening their immune systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Researchers have identified some specific nutrients that bees need, get from honey, and don’t get from corn syrup. When honeybees collect nectar from flowers, they also gather pollen and a substance called propolis, which they use to make waxy honeycombs. The pollen and propolis are loaded with three types of compounds that can help the bees detoxify their cells and protect themselves from pesticides and microbes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is implementing various Schemes for Environmental Conservation. The funding under the Central Sector Schemes is 100 percent from the Government of India. Under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes, as per the revised funding pattern from 2015- 16 onwards, the Government of India’s share is 50 percent for rest of India and 80 percent for the North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States i.e Jammu &amp;&nbsp;Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand in environment sector. The share of the Government of India is 60 percent for rest of India in the schemes related to forestry and wildlife and 90 percent in respect of North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Neonicotinoids</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Neonicotinoids are a new class of insecticides chemically related to nicotine. The name literally means “new nicotine-like insecticides”. Like nicotine, the neonicotinoids act on certain kinds of receptors in the nerve synapse. They are much more toxic to invertebrates, like insects, than they are to mammals, birds and other higher organisms. Neonicotinoids share a common mode of action that affect the central nervous system of insects, resulting in paralysis and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">One thing that has made neonicotinoid insecticides popular in pest control is their water solubility, which allows them to be applied to soil and be taken up by plants. Soil insecticide applications reduce the risks for insecticide drift from the target site, and for at least some beneficial insects on plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">They include imidacloprid, acetamiprid, clothianidin, di-notefuran, nithiazine, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Uncertainties prevail since their initial registration regarding the potential environmental fate and effects of neoni-cotinoid pesticides, particularly as they relate to pollinators. Studies conducted in the late 1990s suggest that neonico-tinic residues can accumulate in pollen and nectar of treated plants and represent a potential risk to pollinators. There is major concern that neonicotinic pesticides play a role in recent pollinator declines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Neonicotinods can also be persistent in the environment, and when used as seed treatments, translocate to residues in pollen and nectar of treated plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">New research points out potential toxicity to bees and other beneficial insects through low level contamination of nectar and pollen with neonicotinoid insecticides used in agriculture. Although the low level exposures do not normally kill bees directly, they may impact some bee’s ability to foraging for nectar, learn and remember where flowers are located, and possibly impair their ability to find their way home to the nest or hive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">In April 2013, the European Commission decided to introduce a 2-year moratorium in EU on the 3 neonicotinod compounds—clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiameth-oxam—following reports by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) saying the substances pose an “acute risk” to honey bees essential to farming and natural ecosystems.</span></p>
