<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Climate Change can affect crop yield as well as the types of crops that can be grown in certain areas, by impacting agricultural inputs such as water for irrigation, amounts of solar radiation that affect plant growth, as well as the prevalence of pests.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Rise in temperatures caused by increasing green house gases is likely to affect crops differently from region to region. For example, moderate warming (increase of 1 to 3°C in mean temperature) is expected to benefit crop yields in temperate regions, while in lower latitudes especially seasonally dry tropics, even moderate temperature increases (1 to 2°C ) are likely to have negative impacts for major cereal crops. Warming of more than 3°C is expected to have negative effect on production in all regions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC, 2001 concluded that climate change would hit the poorest countries severely in terms of reducing the agricultural products.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Report claimed that crop yield would be reduced in most tropical and sub-tropical regions due to decreased water availability, and new or changed insect/ pest incidence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In South Asia losses of many regional staples, such as rice, millet and maize could top 10 per cent by 2030.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> As a result of thawing of snow, the amount of arable land in high-latitude region is likely to increase by reduction of the amount of frozen lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> At the same time arable land along the coast lines are bound to be reduced as a result of rising sea level.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Erosion, submergence of shorelines, salinity of the water table due to the increased sea levels, could mainly affect agriculture through inundation of low lying lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In a recent study, the International Commission for Snow and Ice (ICSE) reported that Himalayan glaciers - that are the principal dry-season water sources of Asia’s biggest rivers - Ganges, Indus, Brahmaputra, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Yellow - are shrinking quicker than anywhere else and that if current trends continue they could disappear altogether by 2035.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> If agricultural production in the low-income developing countries of Asia and Africa is adversely affected by climate change, the livelihoods of large numbers of the rural poor will be put at risk and their vulnerability to food insecurity will be manifold.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">A conifer usually has a conical appearance and has an excurrent stem; i.e., its main stem is thickest at the base and gradually tapers toward the apex, with lateral branches in an acropetal succession.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>20.1.1. Impacts on Indian agriculture</span></h3></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A large part of the arable land in India is rain-fed, the productivity of agriculture depends on the rainfall and its pattern.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Agriculture will be adversely affected not only by an increase or decrease in the overall amounts of rainfall but also by shifts in the timing of the rainfall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Any change in rainfall patterns poses a serious threat to agriculture, and therefore to the economy and food security.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Summer rainfall accounts for almost 70 per cent of the total annual rainfall over India and is crucial to Indian agriculture.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> However, studies predict decline in summer rainfall by the 2050s.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Semi arid regions of western India are expected to receive higher than normal rainfall as temperatures soar, while central India will experience a decrease of between 10 and 20 per cent in winter rainfall by the 2050s.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Relatively small climate changes can cause large water resources problems particularly in arid and semi arid regions such as northwest India.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Productivity of most crops may decrease due to increase in temperature and decrease in water availability, especially in Indo-Gangetic plains.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> This apart, there would be a decline in the productivity of rabi as compared to kharif season crops.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Rising temperature would increase fertilizer requirement for the same production targets and result in higher GHG emissions, ammonia volatilization and cost of crop production.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Increased frequencies of droughts, floods, storms and cyclones are likely to increase agricultural production variability.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">The sloth bear, also known as the labiated bear, is a nocturnal insectivorous species of bear found wild within the Indian subcontinent. They feed on termites, honeybee colonies and fruits</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Lack of access to water is a perturbing issue, particularly in developing countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Climate change is expected to exacerbate current stresses on water resources.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> By 2020, between 75 and 250 million people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Spreading water scarcity is contributing to food insecurity and heightened competitions for water both within and between countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> As the world population expands and the consumption of water spirals upwards, water problems are bound to intensify.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Increase in temperature due to climate change has been widespread over the globe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Warming has resulted in decline in mountain glaciers and snow cover in both hemispheres and this is projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> This will in turn lead to reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and would change the seasonal flow of rivers in regions supplied by melt water from major mountain ranges (e.g. Hindu-Kush, Himalaya, Andes).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> By 2050s freshwater availability in Central, South, East and South-East Asia, particularly in large river basins, is projected to decrease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A warmer climate will accelerate the hydrologic cycle, altering rainfall, magnitude and timing of run-off.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Available research suggests a significant future increase in heavy rainfall events in many regions, while in some regions the mean rainfall is projected to decrease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The frequency of severe floods in large river basins has increased during the 20th century.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Increasing floods poses challenges to society, physical infrastructure and water quality.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Rising temperatures will further affect the physical, chemical and biological properties of fresh water lakes and rivers, with predominantly adverse impacts on many individual fresh water species, community composition and water quality.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In coastal areas, sea level rise will exacerbate water resource constraints due to increased salinisation of groundwater supplies.</span></p></li>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold; color: maroon;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2 0.2.1. Impacts on water situation in India</span></h3></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Water resources will come under increasing pressure in the Indian subcontinent due to the changing climate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Himalayan glaciers are a source of fresh water for perennial rivers, in particular the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra river systems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In recent decades, the Himalayan region seems to have undergone substantial changes as a result of extensive land use (e.g. deforestation, agricultural practices and urbanization), leading to frequent hydrological disasters, enhanced sedimentation and pollution of lakes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> There is evidence that some Himalayan glaciers have retreated significantly since the 19th century.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Available records suggest that the Gangotri glacier is retreating about 28 m per year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Glacial melt is expected to increase under changed climate conditions, which would lead to increased summer flows in some river systems for a few decades, followed by a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> As a result of increase in temperature significant changes in rainfall pattern have been observed during the 20th century in India.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A serious environmental problem has also been witnessed in the Indo-Gangetic Plain Region (IGPR) in the past whereby different rivers (including Kosi, Ganga, Ghaghara, Son, Indus and its tributaries and Yamuna) changed their course a number of times.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The recent devastating floods in Nepal and Bihar due to change of course of River Kosi is a case in point.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Available study suggests that food production has to be increased to the tune of 300 mt by 2020 in order to feed India’s ever-growing population, which is likely to reach 1.30 billion by the year 2020.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The total foodgrain production has to be increased by 50 per cent by 2020 to meet the requirement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It is feared that the fast increasing demand for food in the next two or three decades could be quite grim particularly in view of the serious problem of soil degradation and climate change.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The rise in population will increase the demand for water leading to faster withdrawal of water and this in turn would reduce the recharging time of the water tables.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> As a result, availability of water is bound to reach critical levels sooner or later. During the past four decades, there has been a phenomenal increase in the growth of groundwater abstraction structures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Growing demand of water in agriculture, industrial and domestic sectors, has brought problems of overexploitation of the groundwater resource to the fore.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The falling groundwater levels in various parts of the country have threatened the sustainability of the groundwater resources.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> At present, available statistics on water demand shows that the agriculture sector is the largest consumer of water in India.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> About 83% of the available water is used for agriculture alone. If used judiciously, the demand may come down to about 68% by the year 2050, though agriculture will still remain the largest consumer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In order to meet this demand, augmentation of the existing water resources by development of additional sources of water or conservation of the existing resources and their efficient use will be needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It is evident that the impact of global warming threats are many and alarming.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Water security in terms of quantity and quality pose problems for both developed and developing countries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> However, the consequences of future climatic change may be felt more severely in developing countries such as India, whose economy is largely dependent on agriculture and is already under stress due to current population increase and associated demands for energy, freshwater and food.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Sea level rise is both due to thermal expansion as well as melting of ice sheets.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Satellite observations available since the early 1990s show that since 1993, sea level has been rising at a rate per year, significantly higher than the average during the previous half-century.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> IPCC predicts that sea levels could rise rapidly with accelerated ice sheet disintegration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Global temperature increases of 3-4°C could result in 330 million people being permanently or temporarily displaced through flooding.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The National Environment Policy, 2006 states that the Indian Desert Ecosystems (arid and semi-arid region) occupies 127.3 mha (38.8%) of the country’s geographical area and spreads over 10 states.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The Indian desert fauna is extremely rich in species diversity of mammals and winter migratory birds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Recent studies have shown that deserts have shown signs of expansion, thus leading to a process called desertification.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The climate patterns have altered the natural attributes of a desert region; for example the floods in the desert district of Barmer in Rajasthan in 2006.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Coastal and Marine Ecosystem is one of the assets of India.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The mangrove forests (wetlands) of the rivers and the coasts acts as carbon sink as well as a habitat for a unique and diverse species of plants and animals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The wetlands act as a natural barrier to flooding (that may be caused by the rising sea levels) and cyclones.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The most explicit event in the perspective of climate change affecting the marine ecosystem is the example of coral bleaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In the Peninsular India, even the rivers of the Peninsula are dependent on the monsoons, thus the Peninsular Ecosystem is basically a monsoon dependent ecosystem.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> India is heavily dependent on the monsoon to meet its agricultural and water needs, and also for protecting and propagating its rich biodiversity. Climate change is linked with the changing patterns observed in the monsoons of India.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Climate change poses a host of threats to the survival of mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Each year, about 800,000 people die from causes attributable to air pollution, 1.8 million from diarrhoea resulting from lack of access to clean water supply, sanitation, and poor hygiene, 3.5 million from malnutrition and approximately 60,000 in natural disasters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> A warmer and more variable climate would result in higher levels of some air pollutants, increased transmission of diseases through unclean water and through contaminated food.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Climate change has a direct impact on human health.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> For example, the warmer the climate the likelihood of its impact on human health becomes worse.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It is anticipated that there will be an increase in the number of deaths due to greater frequency and severity of heat waves and other extreme weather events.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Climate change and the resulting higher global temperatures are causing increasing frequency of floods and droughts leading to the risk of disease infections.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Lack of freshwater during droughts and contamination of freshwater supplies during floods compromise hygiene, thus increasing rates of diarrhoeal disease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease primarily associated with floods and droughts are expected to rise in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in hydrological cycle.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Flooding also creates opportunities for breeding of disease carrying insects such as mosquitoes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Areas affected by frequent floods and drought conditions also witness large scale migration of populations to relatively stable regions leading to overcrowding and unhygienic conditions resulting in transmission of diseases like Japanese encephalitis and malaria.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Climate change is a major factor in the spread of infectious diseases. Diseases, confined to one specific geographic region spread to other areas.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The World Health Organization (WHO) in their studies have indicated that due to rising temperatures, malaria cases are now being reported for the first time from countries like Nepal and Bhutan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> It has also been predicted that an additional 220-400 million people could be exposed to malaria- a disease that claims around 1 million lives annually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Dengue fever is already in evidence at higher levels of elevation in Latin America and parts of East Asia.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Studies suggest that climate change may swell the population at risk of malaria in Africa by 90 million by 2030, and the global population at risk of dengue by 2 billion by 2080s.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Rising temperatures and changing patterns of rainfall are projected to decrease crop yields in many developing countries, stressing food supplies. This will ultimately translate into wider prevalence of malnutrition/ undernutrition. In some African countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 per cent by 2020.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> Emission of the Green House Gases have been responsible for the depletion of ozone layer, which protects the Earth from the harmful direct rays of the sun. Depletion of stratospheric ozone results in higher exposure to the ultra violet rays of the sun, leading to an increase in the incidents of skin cancer. It could also lead to an increase in the number of people suffering from eye diseases such as cataract. It is also thought to cause suppression of the immune system.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The projections by WHO and IPCC suggest that the negative effects of climate change on health are greater.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> In addition, the negative effects are concentrated on poor populations that already have compromised health prospects, thus widening the inequality gap between the most and the least privileged.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;"> The balance of positive and negative health impacts will vary from one location to another, and will alter over time as temperatures continue to rise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-size: 105%; text-align: justify;">Saponins are a group of water-soluble glucosides that yield soap froth in water, form emulsions with oils and fats, and are capable of absorbing large amounts of gases such as carbon dioxide. Soap nut tree yields saponins.</span></p>
