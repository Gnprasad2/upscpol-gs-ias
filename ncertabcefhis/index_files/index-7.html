</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries about 85 per cent of the population of India lived in its villages. Both peasants and landed elites were involved in agricultural production and claimed rights to a share of the produce. This created relationships of cooperation, competition and conflict among them. The sum of these </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">agrarian </span><span class="font30">relationships made up rural society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">At the same time agencies from outside also entered into the rural world. Most important among these was the Mughal state, which derived the bulk of its income from agricultural production. Agents of the state - revenue assessors, collectors, record keepers - sought to control rural society so as to ensure that cultivation took place and the state got its regular share of taxes from the produce. Since many crops were grown for sale, trade, money and markets entered the villages and linked the agricultural areas with the towns.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1. PEASANTS AND AGRICULTURAL</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The basic unit of agricultural society was the village, inhabited by peasants who performed the manifold seasonal tasks that made up agricultural production throughout the year - tilling the soil, sowing seeds, harvesting the crop when it was ripe. Further, they contributed their labour to the production of agro-based goods such as sugar and oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">But rural India was not characterised by settled peasant production alone. Several kinds of areas such as large tracts of dry land or hilly regions were not cultivable in the same way as the more fertile</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">expanses of land. In addition, forest areas made up a substantial proportion of territory. We need to keep this varied topography in mind when discussing agrarian society.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>1.1 Looking for sources</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Our understanding of the workings of rural society does not come from those who worked the land, as peasants did not write about themselves. Our major source for the agrarian history of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries are chronicles and documents from the Mughal court (see also Chapter 9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">One of the most important chronicles was the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain-i Akbari</span><span class="font30"> (in short the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain,</span><span class="font30"> see also Section 8) authored by Akbar’s court historian Abu’l Fazl. This text meticulously recorded the arrangements made by the state to ensure cultivation, to enable the collection of revenue by the agencies of the state and to regulate the relationship between the state and rural magnates, the zamindars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The central purpose of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> was to present a vision of Akbar’s empire where social harmony was provided by a strong ruling class. Any revolt or assertion of autonomous power against the Mughal state was, in the eyes of the author of the Ain, predestined to fail. In other words, whatever we learn from the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> about peasants remains a view from the top.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Fortunately, however, the account of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> can be supplemented by descriptions contained in sources emanating from regions away from the Mughal capital. These include detailed revenue records from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Further, the extensive records of the East India Company (see also Chapter 10) provide us with useful descriptions of agrarian relations in eastern India. All these sources record instances of conflicts between peasants, zamindars and the state. In the process they give us an insight into peasants’ perception of and their expectations of fairness from the state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The term which Indo-Persian sources of the Mughal period most frequently used to denote a peasant was </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">raiyat</span><span class="font30"> (plural, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">riaya)</span><span class="font30"> or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">muzarian.</span><span class="font30"> In addition, we also encounter the terms </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kisan</span><span class="font30"> or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">asarni.</span><span class="font30"> Sources of the seventeenth century refer to two kinds of peasants - </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">khud-kashta</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">pahi-kashta.</span><span class="font30"> The former</span></p>

<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font50">This was a feature of agrarian society which struck a keen observer like Babur, the first Mughal emperor, forcefully enough for him to write about it in the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Babur Nama,</span><span class="font50"> his memoirs;</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">In Hindustan hamlets and villages, towns indeed, are depopulated and set up in a moment! If the people of a large town, one inhabited for years even, flee from it, they do it in such a way that not a sign or trace of them remains in a day and a half. On the other hand, if they fix their eyes on a place to settle, they need not dig water courses because their crops are all rain-grown, and as the population of Hindustan is unlimited it swarms in. They make a tank or a well; they need not build houses or set up walls ... </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">khas-grass</span><span class="font50"> abounds, wood is unlimited, huts are made, and straightaway there is a village or a town!</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">were residents of the village in which they held their lands. The latter were non-resident cultivators who belonged to some other village, but cultivated lands elsewhere on a contractual basis. People became </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">pahi-kashta</span><span class="font30"> either out of choice - for example, when terms of revenue in a distant village were more favourable - or out of compulsion - for example, forced by economic distress after a famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Seldom did the average peasant of north India possess more than a pair of bullocks and two ploughs; most possessed even less. In Gujarat peasants possessing about six acres of land were considered to be affluent; in Bengal, on the other hand, five acres was the upper limit of an average peasant farm; 10 acres would make one a rich </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">asami. </span><span class="font30">Cultivation was based on the principle of individual ownership. Peasant lands were bought and sold in the same way as the lands of other property owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This nineteenth-century description of peasant holdings in the Delhi-Agra region would apply equally to the seventeenth century:</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The cultivating peasants </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(asamis),</span><span class="font30"> who plough up the fields, mark the limits of each field, for identification and demarcation, with borders of (raised) earth, brick and thorn so that </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">thousands of such fields</span><span class="font30"> may be counted in a village.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>1.3 Irrigation and technology</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The abundance of land, available labour and the mobility of peasants were three factors that accounted for the constant expansion of agriculture. Since the primary purpose of agriculture is to feed people, basic staples such as rice, wheat or millets were the most frequently cultivated crops. Areas which received 40 inches or more of rainfall a year were generally rice-producing zones, followed by wheat and millets, corresponding to a descending scale of precipitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Monsoons remained the backbone of Indian agriculture, as they are even today. But there were crops which required additional water. Artificial systems of irrigation had to be devised for this.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font54" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Irrigating trees and fields</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This is an excerpt from the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Babur Nama</span><span class="font50"> that describes the irrigation devices the emperor observed in northern India:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The greater part of Hindustan country is situated on level land. Many though its towns and cultivated lands are, it nowhere has running waters ... For ... water is not at all a necessity in cultivating crops and orchards. Autumn crops grow by the downpour of the rains themselves; and strange it is that spring crops grow even when no rains fall. (However) to young trees water is made to flow by means of buckets or wheels ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">In Lahore, Dipalpur (both in present-day Pakistan) and those other parts, people water by means of a wheel. They make two circles of rope long enough to suit the depths of the well, fix strips of wood between them, and on these fasten pitchers. The ropes with the wood and attached pitchers are put over the wheel-well. At one end of the wheel-axle a second wheel is fixed, and close to it another on an upright axle. The last wheel the bullock turns; its teeth catch in the teeth of the second (wheel), and thus the wheel with the pitchers is turned. A trough is set where the water empties from the pitchers and from this the water is conveyed everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">In Agra, Chand war, Bayana (all in present-day Uttar Pradesh) and those parts again, people water with a bucket ... At the well-edge they set up a fork of wood, having a roller adjusted between the forks, tie a rope to a large bucket, put the rope over a roller, and tie its other end to the bullock. One person must drive the bullock, another empty the bucket.</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The spread of tobacco</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This plant, which arrived first in the Deccan, spread to northern India in the early years of the seventeenth century The </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font50"> does not mention tobacco in the lists of crops in northern India. Akbar and his nobles came across tobacco for the first time in 1604. At this time smoking tobacco (in </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">hookahs or chillums) </span><span class="font50">seems to have caught on in a big way. Jahangir was so concerned about its addiction that he banned it. This was totally ineffective because by the end of the seventeenth century, tobacco had become a major article of consumption, cultivation and trade all over India.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Agricultural prosperity and population growth </span><span class="font50">One important outcome of such varied and flexible forms of agricultural production was a slow demographic growth. Despite periodic disruptions caused by famines and epidemics, India’s population increased, according to calculations by economic historians, by about 50 million people between 1600 and 1800, which is an increase of about 33 per cent over 200 years.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Irrigation projects received state support as well. For example, in northern India the state undertook digging of new canals </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(nahr, rialo}</span><span class="font30"> and also repaired old ones like the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">shahnahr</span><span class="font30"> in the Punjab during Shah Jahan’s reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Though agriculture was labour intensive, peasants did use technologies that often harnessed cattle energy. One example was the wooden plough, which was light and easily assembled with an iron tip or coulter. It therefore did not make deep furrows, which preserved the moisture better during the intensely hot months. A drill, pulled by a pair of giant oxen, was used to plant seeds, but broadcasting of seed was the most prevalent method. Hoeing and weeding were done simultaneously using a narrow iron blade with a small wooden handle.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>1.4 An abundance of crops</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Agriculture was organised around two major seasonal cycles, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kharif</span><span class="font30"> (autumn) and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">rabi </span><span class="font30">(spring). This would mean that most regions, except those terrains that were the most arid or inhospitable, produced a minimum of two crops a year </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(do-fasla),</span><span class="font30"> whereas some, where rainfall or irrigation assured a continuous supply of water, even gave three crops. This ensured an enormous variety of produce. For instance, we are told in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> that the Mughal provinces of Agra produced 39 varieties of crops and Delhi produced 43 over the two seasons. Bengal produced 50 varieties of rice alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">However, the focus on the cultivation of basic staples did not mean that agriculture in medieval India was only for subsistence. We often come across the term </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jins-i kamil</span><span class="font30"> (literally, perfect crops) in our sources. The Mughal state also encouraged peasants to cultivate such crops as they brought in more revenue. Crops such as cotton and sugarcane were </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jins-i kamil</span><span class="font30"> par excellence. Cotton was grown over a great swathe of territory spread over central India and the Deccan plateau, whereas Bengal was famous for its sugar. Such cash crops would also include various sorts of oilseeds (for example, mustard) and lentils. This shows how subsistence and commercial production were closely intertwined in an average peasant’s holding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">During the seventeenth century several new crops from different parts of the world reached the Indian subcontinent. Maize </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(makka),</span><span class="font30"> for example, was introduced into India via Africa and Spain and by the seventeenth century it was being listed as one of the major crops of western India. Vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes and chillies were introduced from the New World at this time, as were fruits like the pineapple and the papaya.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The above account makes it clear that agricultural production involved the intensive participation and initiative of the peasantry. How did this affect the structure of agrarian relations in Mughal society? To find out, let us look at the social groups involved in agricultural expansion, and at their relationships and conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">We have seen that peasants held their lands in individual ownership. At the same time they belonged to a collective village community as far as many aspects of their social existence were concerned. There were three constituents of this community -the cultivators, the panchayat, and the village headman </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(muqaddam</span><span class="font30"> or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mandal).</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>2.1 Caste and the rural milieu</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font30">O Describe what women and men are shown doing in the illustration as well as the architecture of the village.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Deep inequities on the basis of caste and other castelike distinctions meant that the cultivators were a highly heterogeneous group. Among those who tilled the land, there was a sizeable number who worked as menials or agricultural labourers </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(mqjurj.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Despite the abundance of cultivable land, certain caste groups were assigned menial tasks and thus relegated to poverty. Though there was no census at that time, the little data that we have suggest that such groups comprised a large section of the village population, had the least resources and were constrained by their position in the caste hierarchy, much like the Dalits of modern India. Such distinctions had begun permeating into other communities too. In Muslim communities menials like the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">halalkhoran</span><span class="font30"> (scavengers) were housed outside the boundaries of the village; similarly the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mallahzadas </span><span class="font30">(literally, sons of boatmen) in Bihar were comparable to slaves.</span></p>
<div><img src="index-198.jpg" alt="" style="width:311pt;height:232pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">There was a direct correlation between caste, poverty and social status at the lower strata of society. Such correlations were not so marked at intermediate levels. In a manual from seventeenthcentury Marwar, Rajputs are mentioned as peasants, sharing the same space with Jats, who were accorded a lower status in the caste hierarchy. The Gauravas, who cultivated land around Vrindavan (Uttar Pradesh), sought Rajput status in the seventeenth century. Castes such as the Ahirs, Gujars and Malis rose in the hierarchy because of the profitability of cattle rearing and horticulture. In the eastern regions, intermediate pastoral and fishing castes like the Sadgops and Kaivartas acquired the status of peasants.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>2.2 Panchayats and headmen</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The village panchayat was an assembly of elders, usually important people of the village with hereditary rights over their property. In mixed-caste villages, the panchayat was usually a heterogeneous body. An oligarchy, the panchayat represented various castes and communities in the village, though the village menial-cum-agricultural worker was unlikely to be represented there. The decisions made by these panchayats were binding on the members.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Corrupt </span><span class="font39" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">mandats</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">mandate</span><span class="font50"> often misused their positions. They were principally accused of defrauding village accounts in connivance with the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">patwari,</span><span class="font50"> and for underassessing the revenue they owed from their own lands in order to pass the additional burden on to the smaller cultivator.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The panchayat was headed by a headman known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">muqaddam</span><span class="font30"> or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mandate</span><span class="font30"> Some sources suggest that the headman was chosen through the consensus of the village elders, and that this choice had to be ratified by the zamindar. Headmen held office as long as they enjoyed the confidence of the village elders, failing which they could be dismissed by them. The chief function of the headman was to supervise the preparation of village accounts, assisted by the accountant or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">patwari</span><span class="font30"> of the panchayat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The panchayat derived its funds from contributions made by individuals to a common financial pool. These funds were used for defraying the costs of entertaining revenue officials who visited the village from time to time. Expenses for community welfare activities such as tiding over</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">natural calamities (like floods), were also met from these funds. Often these funds were also deployed in construction of a bund or digging a canal which peasants usually could not afford to do on their own.</span></p>
<div><img src="index-199.jpg" alt="" style="width:305pt;height:197pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">One important function of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">panchayat</span><span class="font30"> was to ensure that caste boundaries among the various communities inhabiting the village were upheld. In eastern India all marriages were held in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">presence of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mandal.</span><span class="font30"> In other words one of the duties of the village headman was to oversee the conduct of the members of the village community “chiefly to prevent any offence against their caste”.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Panchayats also had the authority to levy fines and inflict more serious forms of punishment like expulsion from the community. The latter was a drastic step and was in most cases meted out for a limited period. It meant that a person forced to leave the village became an outcaste and lost his right to practise his profession. Such a measure was intended as a deterrent to violation of caste norms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In addition to the village panchayat each caste or jati in the village had its own jati panchayat. These panchayats wielded considerable power in rural society. In Rajasthan jati panchayats arbitrated civil disputes between members of different castes. They mediated in contested claims on land, decided whether marriages were performed according to the norms laid down by a particular caste group, determined who had ritual precedence in village functions, and so on. In most cases, except in matters of criminal justice, the state respected the decisions of jati panchayats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Archival records from western India - notably Rajasthan and Maharashtra - contain petitions presented to the panchayat complaining about extortionate taxation or the demand for unpaid labour </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(begar)</span><span class="font30"> imposed by the “superior” castes or officials of the state. These petitions were usually made by villagers, from the lowest rungs of rural society. Often petitions were made collectively as well, by a caste group or a community protesting against what they considered were morally illegitimate demands on the part of elite groups. These included excessive tax demands which,</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The decision of the panchayat in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">conflicts between “lower-caste” peasants and state officials or the local zamindar could vary from case to case. In cases of excessive revenue demands, the panchayat often suggested compromise. In cases where reconciliation failed, peasants took recourse to more drastic forms of resistance, such as deserting the village. The relatively easy availability of uncultivated land and the competition over labour resources made this an effective weapon in the hands of cultivators.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Another interesting aspect of the village was the elaborate relationship of exchange between different producers. Marathi documents and village surveys made in the early years of British rule have revealed the existence of substantial numbers of artisans, sometimes as high as 25 per cent of the total households in the villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">At times, however, the distinction between artisans and peasants in village society was a fluid one, as many groups performed the tasks of both. Cultivators and their families would also participate in craft production - such as dyeing, textile printing, baking and firing of pottery, making and repairing</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">agricultural implements. Phases in the agricultural calendar when there was a relative lull in activity, as between sowing and weeding or between weeding and harvesting, were a time when cultivators could engage in artisanal production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Village artisans - potters, blacksmiths, carpenters, barbers, even goldsmiths - provided specialised services in return for which they were compensated by villagers by a variety of means. The most common way of doing so was by giving them a share of the harvest, or an allotment of land, perhaps cultivable wastes, which was likely to be decided by the panchayat. In Maharashtra such lands became the artisans’ </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">miros</span><span class="font30"> or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">watan -</span><span class="font30"> their hereditary holding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Another variant of this was a system where artisans and individual peasant households entered into a mutually negotiated system of remuneration, most of the time goods for services. For example, eighteenth-century records tell us of zamindars in Bengal who remunerated blacksmiths, carpenters, even goldsmiths for their work by paying them “a small daily allowance and diet money”. This later came to be described as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jajmani</span><span class="font30"> system, though the term was not in vogue in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Such evidence is interesting because it indicates the intricate ways in which exchange networks operated at the micro-level of the village. Cash remuneration was not entirely unknown either.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">How does one understand the significance of the village community? Some British officials in the nineteenth century saw the village as a “little republic” made up of fraternal partners sharing resources and labour in a collective. However, this was not a sign of rural egalitarianism. There was individual ownership of assets and deep inequities based on caste and gender distinctions. A group of powerful individuals decided the affairs of the village, exploited the weaker sections and had the authority to dispense justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">More importantly, a cash nexus had already developed through trade between villages and towns. In the Mughal heartland too, revenue was assessed and collected in cash. Artisans producing for the export market (for example, weavers) received their</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Money in the village</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The seventeenth-century French traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier found it remarkable that in “India a village must be very small indeed if it has not a moneychanger called a Shroff.

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">As you may have observed in many different societies, the production process often involves men and women performing certain specified roles. In the contexts that we are exploring, women and men had to work shoulder to shoulder in the fields. Men tilled and ploughed, while women sowed, weeded, threshed and winnowed the harvest. With the growth of nucleated villages and expansion in individuated peasant farming, which characterised medieval Indian agriculture, the basis of production was the labour and resources of the entire household. Naturally, a gendered segregation between the home (for women) and the world (for men) was not possible in this context. Nonetheless biases related to women’s biological functions did continue. Menstruating women, for instance, were not allowed to touch the plough or the potter’s wheel in western India, or enter the groves where betel-leaves </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(pctctn) were </span><span class="font30">grown in Bengal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Artisanal tasks such as spinning yarn, sifting and kneading clay for pottery, and embroidery were among the many aspects of production dependent on female labour. The more commercialised the product, the greater the demand on women’s labour to produce it. In fact, peasant and artisan women worked not only in the fields, but even went to the houses of their employers or to the markets if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Women were considered an important resource in agrarian society also because they were child bearers in a society dependent on labour. At the same time, high mortality rates among women - owing to malnutrition, frequent pregnancies, death during childbirth - often meant a shortage of wives. This led to the emergence of social customs in peasant and artisan communities that were distinct from those prevalent among elite groups. Marriages in many rural communities required the payment of bride-price rather than dowry to the bride’s family. Remarriage was considered legitimate both among divorced and widowed women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The importance attached to women as a reproductive force also meant that the fear of losing control over them was great. According to established social norms, the household was headed by a male. Thus women were kept under strict control by the male members of the family and the community. They could inflict draconian punishments if they suspected infidelity on the part of women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Documents from Western India - Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra - record petitions sent by women to the village panchayat, seeking redress and justice. Wives protested against the infidelity of their husbands or the neglect of the wife and children by the male head of the household, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">grihasthi.</span><span class="font30"> While male infidelity was not always punished, the state and “superior” caste groups did intervene when it came to ensuring that the family was adequately provided for. In most cases when women petitioned to the panchayat, their names were excluded from the record: the petitioner was referred to as the mother, sister or wife of the male head of the household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Amongst the landed gentry, women had the right to inherit property. Instances from the Punjab show that women, including widows, actively participated in the rural land market as sellers of property inherited by them. Hindu and Muslim women inherited zamindaris which they were free to sell or mortgage. Women zamindars were known in eighteenth-century Bengal. In fact, one of the biggest and most famous of the eighteenth-century zamindaris, that of Rajshahi, had a woman at the helm.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">There was more to rural India than sedentary agriculture. Apart from the intensively cultivated provinces in northern and north-western India, huge swathes of forests - dense forest </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(jangal)</span><span class="font30"> or scrubland </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(kharbandi) -</span><span class="font30"> existed all over eastern India, central India, northern India (including the Terai on the Indo-Nepal border), Jharkhand, and in peninsular India down the Western Ghats and the Deccan plateau. Though it is nearly impossible to set an all-India average of the forest cover for this period, informed conjectures based on contemporary sources suggest an average of 40 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Forest dwellers were termed </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jangli</span><span class="font30"> in contemporary texts. Being </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jangli,</span><span class="font30"> however, did not mean an absence of “civilisation”, as popular usage of the term today seems to connote. Rather, the term described those whose livelihood came from the gathering of forest produce, hunting and shifting agriculture. These activities were largely season specific. Among the Bhils, for example, spring was reserved for collecting forest produce, summer for fishing, the monsoon months for cultivation, and autumn and winter for hunting. Such a sequence presumed and perpetuated mobility, which was a distinctive feature of tribes inhabiting these forests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">For the state, the forest was a subversive place - a place of refuge </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(mawas)</span><span class="font30"> for troublemakers. Once again, we turn to Babur who says that jungles provided a good defence “behind which the people of the pargana become stubbornly rebellious and pay no taxes”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">External forces entered the forest in different ways. For instance, the state required elephants for the army. So the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">peshkash</span><span class="font30"> levied from forest people often included a supply of elephants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the Mughal political ideology, the hunt symbolised the overwhelming concern of the state to relate to all its subjects, rich and poor. Regular hunting expeditions, so court historians tell us, enabled the emperor to travel across the extensive territories of his empire and personally attend to the grievances of its inhabitants. The hunt was a subject frequently painted by court artists. The painter resorted to the device of inserting a small scene somewhere in the picture that functioned as a symbol of a harmonious reign.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The spread of commercial agriculture was an important external factor that impinged on the lives of those who lived in the forests. Forest products -like honey, beeswax and gum lac - were in great demand. Some, such as gum lac, became major items of overseas export from India in the seventeenth century. Elephants were also captured and sold. Trade involved an exchange of commodities through barter as well. Some tribes, like the Lohanis in the Punjab, were engaged in overland trade, between India and Afghanistan, and in the town-country trade in the Punjab itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Social factors too wrought changes in the lives of forest dwellers. Like the “big men” of the village community, tribes also had their chieftains. Many tribal chiefs had become zamindars, some even became kings. For this they required to build up an army. They recruited people from their lineage groups or demanded that their fraternity provide military service. Tribes in the Sind region had armies comprising 6,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry. In Assam, the Ahom kings had their </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">peaks,</span><span class="font30"> people who were obliged to render military service in exchange for land. The capture of wild elephants was declared a royal monopoly by the Ahom kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Though the transition from a tribal to a monarchical system had started much earlier, the process seems to have become fully developed only by the sixteenth century. This can be seen from the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain’s</span><span class="font30"> observations on the existence of tribal kingdoms in the north-east. War was a common occurrence. For instance, the Koch kings fought and subjugated a number of neighbouring tribes in a long sequence of wars through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">New cultural influences also began to penetrate into forested zones. Some historians have indeed suggested that sufi saints </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(pirs)</span><span class="font30"> played a major role in the slow acceptance of Islam among agricultural communities emerging in newly colonised places (see also Chapter 6).</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Our story of agrarian relations in Mughal India will not be complete without referring to a class of people in the countryside that lived off agriculture but did not participate directly in the processes of agricultural production. These were the zamindars who were landed proprietors who also enjoyed certain social and economic privileges by virtue of their superior status in rural society. Caste was one factor that accounted for the elevated status of zamindars; another factor was that they performed certain services </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(khidmaf)</span><span class="font30"> for the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The zamindars held extensive personal lands termed </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">milkiyat,</span><span class="font30"> meaning property. </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Milkiyat</span><span class="font30"> lands were cultivated for the private use of zamindars, often with the help of hired or servile labour. The zamindars could sell, bequeath or mortgage these lands at will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Zamindars also derived their power from the fact that they could often collect revenue on behalf of the state, a service for which they were compensated financially. Control over military resources was another source of power. Most zamindars had fortresses </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(qilachas)</span><span class="font30"> as well as an armed contingent comprising units of cavalry, artillery and infantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Thus if we visualise social relations in the Mughal countryside as a pyramid, zamindars clearly constituted its very narrow apex. Abu’l Fazl’s account indicates that an “upper-caste”, Brahmana-Rajput combine had already established firm control over rural society. It also reflects a fairly large representation from the so-called intermediate castes, as we saw earlier, as well as a liberal sprinkling of Muslim zamindaris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Contemporary documents give an impression that conquest may have been the source of the origin of some zamindaris. The dispossession of weaker people by a powerful military chieftain was quite often a way of expanding a zamindari. It is, however, unlikely that the state would have allowed such a show of aggression by a zamindar unless he had been confirmed by an imperial order </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(sanad).</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">A parallel army!</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">According to the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Ain,</span><span class="font50"> the combined military strength of the zamindars in Mughal India was 384,558 cavalry, 4,277,057 infantry, 1,863 elephants, 4,260 cannons, and 4,500 boats.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">More important were the slow processes of zamindari consolidation, which are also documented in sources. These involved colonisation of new lands, by transfer of rights, by order of the state and by purchase. These were the processes which perhaps permitted people belonging to the relatively “lower” castes to enter the rank of zamindars as zamindaris were bought and sold quite briskly in this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A combination of factors also allowed the consolidation of clan- or lineage-based zamindaris. For example, the Rajputs and Jats adopted these strategies to consolidate their control over vast swathes of territory in northern India. Likewise, peasant-pastoralists (like the Sadgops) carved out powerful zamindaris in areas of central and southwestern Bengal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Zamindars spearheaded the colonisation of agricultural land, and helped in settling cultivators by providing them with the means of cultivation, including cash loans. The buying and selling of zamindaris accelerated the process of monetisation in the countryside. In addition, zamindars sold the produce from their </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">milkly at</span><span class="font30"> lands. There is evidence to show that zamindars often established markets </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(haats) </span><span class="font30">to which peasants also came to sell their produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Although there can be little doubt that zamindars were an exploitative class, their relationship with the peasantry had an element of reciprocity, paternalism and patronage. Two aspects reinforce this view. First, the bhakti saints, who eloquently condemned caste-based and other forms of oppression (see also Chapter 6), did not portray the zamindars (or, interestingly, the moneylender) as exploiters or oppressors of the peasantry. Usually it was the</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">revenue official of the state who was the object of their ire. Second, in a large number of agrarian uprisings which erupted in north India in the seventeenth century, zamindars often received the support of the peasantry in their struggle against the state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Revenue from the land was the economic mainstay of the Mughal Empire. It was therefore vital for the state to create an administrative apparatus to ensure control over agricultural production, and to fix and collect revenue from across the length and breadth of the rapidly expanding empire. This apparatus included the office </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(daftar)</span><span class="font30"> of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">diwan</span><span class="font30"> who was responsible for supervising the fiscal system of the empire. Thus revenue officials and record keepers penetrated the agricultural domain and became a decisive agent in shaping agrarian relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Mughal state tried to first acquire specific information about the extent of the agricultural lands in the empire and what these lands produced before fixing the burden of taxes on people. The land revenue arrangements consisted of two stages - first, assessment and then actual collection. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jama</span><span class="font30"> was the amount assessed, as opposed to </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">hasil,</span><span class="font30"> the amount collected. In his list of duties of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">amil-guzar</span><span class="font30"> or revenue collector, Akbar decreed that while he should strive to make cultivators pay in cash, the option of payment in kind was also to be kept open. While fixing revenue, the attempt of the state was to maximise its claims. The scope of actually realising these claims was, however, sometimes thwarted by local conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Both cultivated and cultivable lands were measured in each province. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> compiled the aggregates of such lands during Akbar’s rule. Efforts to measure lands continued under subsequent emperors. For instance, in 1665, Aurangzeb expressly instructed his revenue officials to prepare annual records of the number of cultivators in each village (Source 7). Yet not all areas were measured successfully. As we have seen, forests covered huge areas of the subcontinent and thus remained unmeasured.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">The following is a listing of criteria of classification excerpted from the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Ain:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The Emperor Akbar in his profound sagacity classified the lands and fixed a different revenue to be paid by each. </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Polaj</span><span class="font50"> is land which is annually cultivated for each crop in succession and is never allowed to lie fallow. </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Parauti</span><span class="font50"> is land left out of cultivation for a time that it may recover its strength. </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Chachar</span><span class="font50"> is land that has lain fallow for three or four years. </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Banjar</span><span class="font50"> is land uncultivated for five years and more. Of the first two kinds of land, there are three classes, good, middling, and bad. They add together the produce of each sort, and the third of this represents the medium produce, one-third part of which is exacted as the Royal dues.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The Mughal Empire was among the large territorial empires in Asia that had managed to consolidate power and resources during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. These empires were the Ming (China), Safavid (Iran) and Ottoman (Turkey). The political stability achieved by all these empires helped create vibrant networks of overland trade from China to the Mediterranean Sea. Voyages of discovery and the opening up of the New World resulted in a massive expansion of Asia’s (particularly India’s) trade with Europe. This resulted in a greater geographical diversity of India’s overseas trade as well as an</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">expansion in the commodity composition of this trade. An expanding trade brought in huge amounts of silver bullion into Asia to pay for goods procured from India, and a large part of that bullion gravitated towards India. This was good for India as it did not have natural resources of silver. As a result, the period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries was also marked by a remarkable stability in the availability of metal currency, particularly the silver </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">rupya</span><span class="font30"> in India. This facilitated an unprecedented expansion of minting of coins and the circulation of money in the economy as well as the ability of the Mughal state to extract taxes and revenue in cash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The testimony of an Italian traveller, Giovanni Careri, who passed through India c. 1690, provides a graphic account about the way silver travelled across the globe to reach India. It also gives us an idea of the phenomenal amounts of cash and commodity transactions in seventeenth-century India.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">This excerpt from Giovanni Careri’s account (based on Bernier’s account) gives an idea of the enormous amount of wealth that found its way into the Mughal Empire:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">That the Reader may form some idea of the Wealth of this (Mughal) Empire, he is to observe that all the Gold and Silver, which circulates throughout the World at last Centres here. It is well known that as much of it comes out of America, after running through several Kingdoms of Europe, goes partly into Turky (Turkey), for several sorts of Commodities; and part into Persia, by the way of Smirna for Silk. Now the Turks not being able to abstain from Coffee, which comes from Hyeman (Oman), and Arabia ... nor Persia, Arabia, and the Turks themselves to go without the commodities of India, send vast quantities of Mony (money) to Moka (Mocha) on the Red Sea, near Babel Mandel; to Bassora (Basra) at the bottom of the Persian Gulgh (Gulf); ... which is afterwards sent over in Ships to Indostan (Hindustan). Besides the Indian, Dutch, English, and Portuguese Ships, that every Year carry the Commodities of Indostan, to Pegu, Tanasserri (parts of Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Ceylon (Sri Lanka) ... the Maldive Islands, Mozambique and other Places, must of necessity convey much Gold and Silver thither, from those Countries. All that the Dutch fetch from the Mines in Japan, sooner or later, goes to Indostan; and the goods carry’d hence into Europe, whether to France, England, or Portugal, are all purchas’d for ready Mony, which remains there.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain-i Akbari</span><span class="font30"> was the culmination of a large historical, administrative project of classification undertaken by Abu’l Fazl at the order of Emperor Akbar. It was completed in 1598, the forty-second regnal year of the emperor, after having gone through five revisions. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> was part of a larger project of history writing commissioned by Akbar. This history, known as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nama,</span><span class="font30"> comprised three books. The first two provided a historical narrative. We will look at these parts more closely in Chapter 9.

<p><span class="font30">Collecting and compiling this information systematically was an important imperial exercise. It informed the emperor about the varied and diverse customs and practices prevailing across his extensive territories. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> is therefore a mine of information for us about the Mughal Empire during Akbar’s reign. It is important, however, to keep in mind that this is a view of the regions from the centre, a view of society from its apex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> is made up of five books </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(dqftars),</span><span class="font30"> of which the first three books describe the administration.

This book includes notices and short biographical sketches of imperial officials </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(mansabdars),</span><span class="font30"> learned men, poets and artists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The third book, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mulk-abadi.</span><span class="font30"> is the one which deals with the fiscal side of the empire and provides rich quantitative information on revenue rates, followed by the “Account of the Twelve Provinces”. This section has detailed statistical information, which includes the geographic, topographic and economic profile of all </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">subas and</span><span class="font30"> their administrative and fiscal divisions </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(sarkars, parganas</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahals),</span><span class="font30"> total measured area, and assessed revenue </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(jama).</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>“Moistening the rose garden of fortune”</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">In this extract Abu’l Fazl gives a vivid account of how and from whom he collected his information:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">... to Abu’l Fazl, son of Mubarak ... this sublime mandate was given. “Write with the pen of sincerity the account of the glorious events and of our dominion-conquering victories ... Assuredly, I spent much labour and research in collecting the records and narratives of His Majesty’s actions and I was a long time interrogating the servants of the State and the old members of the illustrious family. I examined both prudent, truth-speaking old men and active-minded, right-actioned young ones and reduced their statements to writing. The Royal commands were issued to the provinces, that those who from old service remembered, with certainty or with adminicle of doubt, the events of the past, should copy out the notes and memoranda and transit them to the court. (Then) a second command shone forth from the holy Presence-chamber; to wit - that the materials which had been collected should be ... recited in the royal hearing, and whatever might have to be written down afterwards, should be introduced into the noble volume as a supplement, and that such details as on account of the minuteness of the inquiries and the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">minutae</span><span class="font50"> of affairs, (which) could not then be brought to an end, should be inserted afterwards at my leisure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Being relieved by this royal order - the interpreter of the Divine ordinance - from the secret anxiety of my heart, I proceeded to reduce into writing the rough draughts (drafts)which were void of the grace of arrangement and style. I obtained the chronicle of events beginning at the Nineteenth Year of the Divine Era, when the Record Office was established by the enlightened intellect of His Majesty, and from its rich pages, I gathered the accounts of many events. Great pains too, were taken to procure the originals or copies of most of the orders which had been issued to the provinces from the Accession up to the present-day ... I also took much trouble to incorporate many of the reports which ministers and high officials had submitted, about the affairs of the empire and the events of foreign countries. And my labour-loving soul was satiated by the apparatus of inquiry and research. I also exerted myself energetically to collect the rough notes and memoranda of sagacious and well-informed men. By these means, I constructed a reservoir for irrigating and moistening the rose garden of fortune (the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nams').</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">।</span><span class="font49">-----------------1</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">| C List all the sources that Abu’l Fazl used to compile his work. Which of these sources would have been most useful for arriving at an understanding of agrarian relations? To what extent do you think his work would have been influenced by his relationship with Akbar?</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Translating the </span><span class="font39" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ain</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Given the importance of the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Ain, </span><span class="font50">it has been translated for use by a number of scholars. Henry Blochmann edited it and the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), published it in its Bibliotheca Indica series. The book has also been translated into English in three volumes. The standard translation of Volume 1 is that of Henry Blochmann (Calcutta 1873). The other two volumes were translated by H.S. Jarrett (Calcutta 1891 and 1894).</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Although the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain was</span><span class="font30"> officially sponsored to record detailed information to facilitate Emperor Akbar govern his empire, it was much more than a reproduction of official papers. That the manuscript was revised five times by the author would suggest a high degree of caution on the part of Abu’l Fazl and a search for authenticity. For instance, oral testimonies were cross-checked and verified before being incorporated as “facts” in the chronicle. In the quantitative sections, all numeric data were reproduced in words so as to minimise the chances of subsequent transcriptional errors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Historians who have carefully studied the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> point out that it is not without its problems. Numerous errors in totalling have been detected. These are ascribed to simple slips of arithmetic or of transcription by Abu’l Fazl’s assistants. These are generally minor and do not detract from the overall quantitative veracity of the manuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Another limitation of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> is the somewhat skewed nature of the quantitative data. Data were not collected uniformly from all provinces. For instance, while for many </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">subas</span><span class="font30"> detailed information was compiled about the caste composition of the zamindars, such information is not available for Bengal and Orissa. Further, while the fiscal data from the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">subas</span><span class="font30"> is remarkable for its richness, some equally vital parameters such as prices and wages from these same areas are not as well documented. The detailed list of prices and wages that the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain </span><span class="font30">does provide is mainly derived from data pertaining to areas in or around the imperial capital of Agra, and is therefore of limited relevance for the rest of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">These limitations notwithstanding, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> remains an extraordinary document of its times. By providing fascinating glimpses into the structure and organisation of the Mughal Empire and by giving us quantitative information about its products and people, Abu’l Fazl achieved a major breakthrough in the tradition of medieval chroniclers who wrote mostly about remarkable political events - wars, conquests, political machinations, and dynastic turmoil. Information about the country, its people and its products was mentioned only incidentally and as embellishments to the essentially political thrust of the narrative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain</span><span class="font30"> completely departed from this tradition as it recorded information about the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">empire</span><span class="font30"> and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">people </span><span class="font30">of India, and thus constitutes a benchmark for studying India at the turn of the seventeenth century. The value of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain’s</span><span class="font30"> quantitative evidence is uncontested where the study of agrarian relations is concerned. But it is the information it contains on people, their professions and trades and on the imperial establishment and the grandees of the empire which enables historians to reconstruct the social fabric of India at that time.</span></p>
