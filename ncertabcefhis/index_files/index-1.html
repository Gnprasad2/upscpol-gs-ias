<p><span class="font30">settlements emerged in many parts of the subcontinent, including north India, the Deccan Plateau, and parts of Karnataka. Besides, there is evidence of pastoral populations in the Deccan and further south. New modes of disposal of the dead, including the making of elaborate stone structures known as megaliths, emerged in central and south India from the first millennium bce. In many cases, the dead were buried with a rich range of iron tools and weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">From c. sixth century bce, there is evidence that there were other trends as well. Perhaps the most visible was the emergence of early states, empires and kingdoms. Underlying these political processes were other changes, evident in the ways in which agricultural production was organised. Simultaneously, new towns appeared almost throughout the subcontinent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Historians attempt to understand these developments by drawing on a range of sources - inscriptions, texts, coins and visual material. As we will see, this is a complex process. You will also notice that these sources do not tell the entire story.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">Epigraphy</span><span class="font30"> is the study of inscriptions.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Some of the most momentous developments in Indian epigraphy took place in the 1830s. This was when James Prinsep, an officer in the mint of the East India Company, deciphered Brahmi and Kharosthi, two scripts used in the earliest inscriptions and coins. He found that most of these mentioned a king referred to as Piyadassi - meaning “pleasant to behold”; there were a few inscriptions which also</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">referred to the king as Asoka, one of the most famous rulers known from Buddhist texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This gave a new direction to investigations into early Indian political history as European and Indian scholars used inscriptions and texts composed in a variety of languages to reconstruct the lineages of major dynasties that had ruled the subcontinent. As a result, the broad contours of political history were in place by the early decades of the twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Subsequently, scholars began to shift their focus to the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">context</span><span class="font30"> of political history, investigating whether there were connections between political changes and economic and social developments. It was soon realised that while there were links, these were not always simple or direct.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The sixth century </span><span class="font50" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bce</span><span class="font30"> is often regarded as a major turning point in early Indian history. It is an era associated with early states, cities, the growing use of iron, the development of coinage, etc. It also witnessed the growth of diverse systems of thought, including Buddhism and Jainism. Early Buddhist and Jaina texts (see also Chapter 4) mention, amongst other things, sixteen states known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahajanapadas.</span><span class="font30"> Although the lists vary, some names such as Vajji, Magadha, Koshala, Kuru, Panchala, Gandhara and Avanti occur frequently. Clearly, these were amongst the most important </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahajanapadas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While most </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahajanapadas</span><span class="font30"> were ruled by kings, some, known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ganas</span><span class="font30"> or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sanghas,</span><span class="font30"> were oligarchies (p. 30), where power was shared by a number of men, often collectively called </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">rajas.</span><span class="font30"> Both Mahavira and the Buddha (Chapter 4) belonged to such </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ganas. </span><span class="font30">In some instances, as in the case of the Vajji </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sangha</span><span class="font30">, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">rajas</span><span class="font30"> probably controlled resources such as land collectively. Although their histories are often difficult to reconstruct due to the lack of sources, some of these states lasted for nearly a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Each </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahajanapada</span><span class="font30"> had a capital city, which was often fortified. Maintaining these fortified cities as well as providing for incipient armies and bureaucracies required resources.

<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Inscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Inscriptions are writings engraved on hard surfaces such as stone, metal or pottery. They usually record the achievements, activities or ideas of those who commissioned them and include the exploits of kings, or donations made by women and men to religious institutions. Inscriptions are virtually permanent records, some of which carry dates. Others are dated on the basis of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">aaleogrrphyy</span><span class="font50"> or styles of writing, with a fair amount of precision. For instance, in </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font50"> 250 bce the letter “a” was written like this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. By </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font50"> 500 ce</span><span class="font50" style="font-variant:small-caps;">,</span><span class="font50"> it was</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">written like this: .</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The earliest inscriptions were in Prakrit, a name for languages used by ordinary people. Names of rulers such as Ajatasattu and Asoka, known from Prakrit texts and inscriptions, have been spelt in their Prakrit forms in this chapter. You will also find terms in languages such as Pali, Tamil and Sanskrit, which too were used to write inscriptions and texts. It is possible that people spoke in other languages as well, even though these were not used for writing.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">century bce onwards, Brahmanas began composing Sanskrit texts known as the Dharmasutras. These laid down norms for rulers (as well as for other social categories), who were ideally expected to be Kshatriyas (see also Chapter 3). Rulers were advised to collect taxes and tribute from cultivators, traders and artisans. Were resources also procured from pastoralists and forest peoples? We do not really know. What we do know is that raids on neighbouring states were recognised as a legitimate means of acquiring wealth. Gradually, some states acquired standing armies and maintained regular bureaucracies. Others continued to depend on militia, recruited, more often than not, from the peasantry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Between the sixth and the fourth centuries bce, Magadha (in present-day Bihar) became the most powerful </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahajanapada</span><span class="font30">. Modern historians explain this development in a variety of ways: Magadha was a region where agriculture was especially productive. Besides, iron mines (in present-day Jharkhand) were accessible and provided resources for tools and weapons. Elephants, an important component of the army, were found in forests in the region. Also, the Ganga and its tributaries provided a means of cheap and convenient communication. However, early Buddhist and Jaina writers who wrote about Magadha attributed its power to the policies of individuals: ruthlessly ambitious kings of whom Bimbisara, Ajatasattu and Mahapadma Nanda are the best known, and their ministers, who helped implement their policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Initially, Rajagaha (the Prakrit name for presentday Rajgir in Bihar) was the capital of Magadha. Interestingly, the old name means “house of the king”. Rajagaha was a fortified settlement, located amongst hills. Later, in the fourth century bce, the capital was shifted to Pataliputra, present-day Patna, commanding routes of communication along the Ganga.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The growth of Magadha culminated in the emergence of the Mauryan Empire. Chandragupta Maurya, who founded the empire (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font30">. 321 bce), extended control as far northwest as Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and his grandson Asoka, arguably the most famous ruler of early India, conquered Kalinga (present-day coastal Orissa).</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>3.1 Finding out about the Mauryas</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Historians have used a variety of sources to reconstruct the history of the Mauryan Empire. These include archaeological finds, especially sculpture. Also valuable are contemporary works, such as the account of Megasthenes (a Greek ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya), which survives in fragments. Another source that is often used is the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Arthashhstra,</span><span class="font30"> parts of which were probably composed by Kautilya or Chanakya, traditionally believed to be the minister of Chandragupta. Besides, the Mauryas are mentioned in later Buddhist, Jaina and Puranic literature, as well as in Sanskrit literary works. While these are useful, the inscriptions of Asoka (c. 272/268-231 bce) on rocks and pillars are often regarded as amongst the most valuable sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Asoka was the first ruler who inscribed his messages to his subjects and officials on stone surfaces - natural rocks as well as polished pillars. He used the inscriptions to proclaim what he understood to be </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">uhamma.</span><span class="font30"> This included respect towards elders, generosity towards Brahmanas and those who renounced worldly life, treating slaves and servants kindly, and respect for religions and traditions other than one’s own.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">There were five major political centres in the empire - the capital Pataliputra and the provincial centres of Taxila, Ujjayini, Tosali and Suvarnagiri, all mentioned in Asokan inscriptions. If we examine the content of these inscriptions, we find virtually the same message engraved everywhere - from the present-day North West Frontier Provinces of Pakistan, to Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Uttarakhand in India. Could this vast empire have had a uniform administrative system? Historians have increasingly come to realise that</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Of the great officers of state, some ... superintend the rivers, measure the land, as is done in Egypt, and inspect the sluices by which water is let out from the main canals into their branches, so that every one may have an equal supply of it. The same persons have charge also of the huntsmen, and are entrusted with the power of rewarding or punishing them according to their deserts. They collect the taxes, and superintend the occupations connected with land; as those of the woodcutters, the carpenters, the blacksmiths, and the miners.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Communication along both land and riverine routes was vital for the existence of the empire. Journeys from the centre to the provinces could have taken weeks if not months. This meant arranging for provisions as well as protection for those who were on the move. It is obvious that the army was an important means for ensuring the latter. Megasthenes mentions a committee with six subcommittees for coordinating military activity. Of these, one looked after the navy, the second managed transport and provisions, the third was responsible for foot-soldiers, the fourth for horses, the fifth for chariots and the sixth for elephants. The activities of the second subcommittee were rather varied: arranging for bullock carts to carry equipment, procuring food for soldiers and fodder for animals, and recruiting servants and artisans to look after the soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Asoka also tried to hold his empire together by propagating dhamma, the principles of which, as we have seen, were simple and virtually universally applicable. This, according to him, would ensure the well-being of people in this world and the next. Special officers, known as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">dhammm mahamatta, </span><span class="font30">were appointed to spread the message of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">dhamma</span><span class="font30">.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>3.3 How important was the empire?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">When historians began reconstructing early Indian history in the nineteenth century, the emergence of the Mauryan Empire was regarded as a major landmark. India was then under colonial rule, and was part of the British empire. Nineteenth and early twentieth century Indian historians found the possibility that there was an empire in early India both challenging and exciting. Also, some of the archaeological finds associated with the Mauryas, including stone sculpture, were considered to be examples of the spectacular art typical of empires. Many of these historians found the message on Asokan inscriptions very different from that of most other rulers, suggesting that Asoka was more powerful and industrious, as also more humble than later rulers who adopted grandiose titles. So it is not surprising that nationalist leaders in the twentieth century regarded him as an inspiring figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Yet, how important was the Mauryan Empire? It lasted for about 150 years, which is not a very long time in the vast span of the history of the subcontinent. Besides, if you look at Map 2, you will notice that the empire did not encompass the entire subcontinent. And even within the frontiers of the empire, control was not uniform.

<p><span class="font50">A </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">chief</span><span class="font50"> is a powerful man whose position may or may not be hereditary. He derives support from his kinfolk. His functions may include performing special rituals, leadership in warfare, and arbitrating disputes. He receives gifts from his subordinates (unlike kings who usually collect taxes) and often distributes these amongst his supporters. Generally, there are no regular armies and officials in chiefdoms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">We know about these states from a variety of sources. For instance, the early Tamil Sangam texts (see also Chapter 3) contain poems describing chiefs and the ways in which they acquired and distributed resources.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">One means of claiming high status was to identify with a variety of deities. This strategy is best exemplified by the Kushanas (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font30">. first century bce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">-</span><span class="font30">first century CE), who ruled over a vast kingdom extending from Central Asia to northwest India. Their history has been reconstructed from inscriptions and textual traditions. The notions of kingship they wished to project are perhaps best evidenced in their coins and sculpture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Colossal statues of Kushana rulers have been found installed in a shrine at Mat near Mathura (Uttar Pradesh). Similar statues have been found in a shrine in Afghanistan as well. Some historians feel this indicates that the Kushanas considered themselves godlike. Many Kushana rulers also adopted the title deuaputra, or “son of god”, possibly inspired by Chinese rulers who called themselves sons of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By the fourth century there is evidence of larger states, including the Gupta Empire. Many of these depended on </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">samnntas,</span><span class="font30"> men who maintained themselves through local resources including control over land. They offered homage and provided military support to rulers. Powerful </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">samantas</span><span class="font30"> could become kings: conversely, weak rulers might find themselves being reduced to positions of subordination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Histories of the Gupta rulers have been reconstructed from literature, coins and inscriptions, including </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">prashastfe,</span><span class="font30"> composed in praise of kings in particular, and patrons in general, by poets.

<p><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>5.1 Popular perceptions of kings</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">What did subjects think about their rulers? Obviously, inscriptions do not provide all the answers. In fact, ordinary people rarely left accounts of their thoughts and experiences. Nevertheless, historians have tried to solve this problem by examining stories contained in anthologies such as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jatakas</span><span class="font30"> and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Panchataatry.</span><span class="font30"> Many of these stories probably originated as popular oral tales that were later committed to writing. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jatakas</span><span class="font30"> were written in Pali around the middle of the first millennium ce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">One story known as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Gaakattnak Jataka </span><span class="font30">describes the plight of the subjects of a wicked king; these included elderly women and men, cultivators, herders, village boys and even animals. When the king went in disguise to find out what his subjects thought about him, each one of them cursed him for their miseries, complaining that they were attacked by robbers at night and by tax collectors during the day. To escape from this situation, people abandoned their village and went to live in the forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As this story indicates, the relationship between a king and his subjects, especially the rural population, could often be strained - kings frequently tried to fill their coffers by demanding high taxes, and peasants particularly found such demands oppressive. Escaping into the forest remained an option, as reflected in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jataka</span><span class="font30"> story. Meanwhile, other strategies aimed at increasing production to meet growing demand for taxes also came to be adopted.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>5.2 Strategies for increasing production</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">One such strategy was the shift to plough agriculture, which spread in fertile alluvial river valleys such as those of the Ganga and the Kaveri from </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> sixth century bce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">.</span><span class="font30"> The iron-tipped ploughshare was used to turn the alluvial soil in areas which had high rainfall. Moreover, in some parts of the Ganga valley, production of paddy was dramatically increased by the introduction of transplantation, although this meant back-breaking work for the producer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While the iron ploughshare led to a growth in agricultural productivity, its use was restricted to certain parts of the subcontinent - cultivators in</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">areas which were semi-arid, such as parts of Punjab and Rajasthan did not adopt it till the twentieth century, and those living in hilly tracts in the northeastern and central parts of the subcontinent practised hoe agriculture, which was much better suited to the terrain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Another strategy adopted to increase agricultural production was the use of irrigation, through wells and tanks, and less commonly, canals. Communities as well as individuals organised the construction of irrigation works. The latter, usually powerful men including kings, often recorded such activities in inscriptions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>5.3 Differences in rural society</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">While these technologies often led to an increase in production, the benefits were very uneven. What is evident is that there was a growing differentiation amongst people engaged in agriculture - stories, especially within the Buddhist tradition, refer to landless agricultural labourers, small peasants, as well as large landholders. The term </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gahapati</span><span class="font30"> was often used in Pali texts to designate the second and third categories. The large landholders, as well as the village headman (whose position was often hereditary), emerged as powerful figures, and often exercised control over other cultivators. Early Tamil literature (the Sangam texts) also mentions different categories of people living in the villages - large landowners or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">vellalar,</span><span class="font30"> ploughmen or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">uzhavar</span><span class="font30"> and slaves or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">adimai.</span><span class="font30"> It is likely that these differences were based on differential access to land, labour and some of the new technologies. In such a situation, questions of control over land must have become crucial, as these were often discussed in legal texts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Seeing that in the world controversies constantly arise due to the ignorance of boundaries, he should ... have ... concealed boundary markers buried - stones, bones, cow’s hair, chaff, ashes, potsherds, dried cow dung, bricks, coal, pebbles and sand.

<p><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>5.4 Land grants and new rural elites</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">From the early centuries of the Common Era, we find grants of land being made, many of which were recorded in inscriptions. Some of these inscriptions were on stone, but most were on copper plates (Fig. 2.13) which were probably given as a record of the transaction to those who received the land. The records that have survived are generally about grants to religious institutions or to Brahmanas. Most inscriptions were in Sanskrit. In some cases, and especially from the seventh century onwards, part of the inscription was in Sanskrit, while the rest was in a local language such as Tamil or Telugu. Let us look at one such inscription more closely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Prabhavati Gupta was the daughter of one of the most important rulers in early Indian history, Chandragupta II (c. 375-415 ce). She was married into another important ruling family, that of the Vakatakas, who were powerful in the Deccan (see Map 3). According to Sanskrit legal texts, women were not supposed to have independent access to resources such as land. However, the inscription indicates that Prabhavati had access to land, which she then granted. This may have been because she was a queen (one of the few known from early Indian history), and her situation was therefore exceptional. It is also possible that the provisions of legal texts were not uniformly implemented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The inscription also gives us an idea about rural populations - these included Brahmanas and peasants, as well as others who were expected to provide a range of produce to the king or his representatives. And according to the inscription, they would have to obey the new lord of the village, and perhaps pay him all these dues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Land grants such as this one have been found in several parts of the country. There were regional variations in the sizes of land donated - ranging from small plots to vast stretches of uncultivated land - and the rights given to donees (the recipients of the grant). The impact of land grants is a subject of heated debate among historians. Some feel that land grants were part of a strategy adopted by ruling lineages to extend agriculture to new areas. Others suggest that land grants were indicative of weakening political power: as kings were losing control over their </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">samantas</span><span class="font30">, they tried to win allies</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">by making grants of land. They also feel that kings tried to project themselves as supermen (as we saw in the previous section) </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">because</span><span class="font30"> they were losing control: they wanted to present at least a facade of power.</span></p>

By the fourth century bce, it was the capital of the Mauryan Empire and one of the largest cities in Asia. Subsequently, its importance apparently declined.

Some such as Pataliputra were on riverine routes. Others, such as Ujjayini, were along land routes, and yet others, such as Puhar, were near the coast, from where sea routes began. Many cities like Mathura were bustling centres of commercial, cultural and political activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">We have seen that kings and ruling elites lived in fortified cities. Although it is difficult to conduct extensive excavations at most sites because people live in these areas even today (unlike the Harappan cities), a wide range of artefacts have been recovered from them. These include fine pottery bowls and dishes, with a glossy finish, known as Northern Black Polished Ware, probably used by rich people, and ornaments, tools, weapons, vessels, figurines, made of a wide range of materials - gold, silver, copper, bronze, ivory, glass, shell and terracotta.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">6.3 Trade in the subcontinent and beyond From the sixth century bce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">,</span><span class="font30"> land and river routes criss-crossed the subcontinent and extended in various directions - overland into Central Asia and beyond, and overseas, from ports that dotted the coastline - extending across the Arabian Sea to East and North Africa and West Asia, and through the Bay of Bengal to Southeast Asia and China. Rulers often attempted to control these routes, possibly by offering protection for a price.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Those who traversed these routes included peddlers who probably travelled on foot and merchants who travelled with caravans of bullock carts and pack-animals. Also, there were seafarers, whose ventures were risky but highly profitable. Successful merchants, designated as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">masattuvan </span><span class="font30">in Tamil and setthis and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">satthavahas</span><span class="font30"> in Prakrit, could become enormously rich. A wide range of goods were carried from one place to another - salt, grain, cloth, metal ores and finished products, stone, timber, medicinal plants, to name a few. Spices, especially pepper, were in high demand in the Roman Empire, as were textiles and medicinal plants, and these were all transported across the Arabian Sea to the Mediterranean.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>6.4 Coins and kings</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">To some extent, exchanges were facilitated by the introduction of coinage. Punch-marked coins made of silver and copper (c. sixth century bce onwards) were amongst the earliest to be minted and used. These have been recovered from excavations at a number of sites throughout the subcontinent. Numismatists have studied these and other coins to reconstruct possible commercial networks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Attempts made to identify the symbols on punch-marked coins with specific ruling dynasties, including the Mauryas, suggest that these were issued by kings. It is also likely that merchants, bankers and townspeople issued some of these coins. The first coins to bear the names and images of rulers were issued by the Indo-Greeks, who established control over the north-western part of the subcontinent </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> second century bce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The kushanas, however, issued the largest hoards of gold coins first gold coins </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> first century CE. These were virtually identical in weight with those issued by contemporary Roman emperors and the Parthian rulers of Iran, and have been found from several sites in north India and Central Asia. The widespread use of gold coins indicates the enormous value of the transactions that were taking place. Besides, hoards of Roman coins have been found from archaeological sites in south India. It is obvious that networks of trade were not confined within political boundaries: south India was not part of the Roman Empire, but there were close connections through trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Coins were also issued by tribal republics such as that of the Yaudheyas of Punjab and Haryana (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> first century ce). Archaeologists have unearthed several thousand copper coins issued by the Yaudheyas, pointing to the latter’s interest and participation in economic exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Some of the most spectacular gold coins were issued by the Gupta rulers. The earliest issues are remarkable for their purity. These coins facilitated long-distance transactions from which kings also benefited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">From </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> sixth century ce onwards, finds of gold coins taper off. Does this indicate that there was some kind of an economic crisis? Historians are divided on this issue. Some suggest that with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire long-distance trade declined, and this affected the prosperity of the states, communities and regions that had benefited from it. Others argue that new towns and networks of trade started emerging around this time. They also point out that though finds of coins of that time are fewer, coins continue to be mentioned in inscriptions and texts. Could it be that there are fewer finds because coins were in circulation rather than being hoarded?</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">So far, we have been studying excerpts from inscriptions amongst other things. But how do historians find out what is written on them?</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>7.1 Deciphering Brahmi</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Most scripts used to write modern Indian languages are derived from Brahmi, the script used in most Asokan inscriptions. From the late eighteenth century, European scholars aided by Indian pandits worked backwards from contemporary Bengali and Devanagari (the script used to write Hindi) manuscripts, comparing their letters with older specimens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Scholars who studied early inscriptions sometimes assumed these were in Sanskrit, although the earliest inscriptions were, in fact, in Prakrit. It was only after decades of painstaking investigations by several epigraphists that James Prinsep was able to decipher Asokan Brahmi in 1838.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>7.2 How Kharosthi was read</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font29">Do some Devanagari letters appear similar to Brahmi? Are there any that seem different?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The story of the decipherment of Kharosthi, the script used in inscriptions in the northwest, is different. Here, finds of coins of Indo-Greek kings who ruled over the area (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font30">. second-first centuries bce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">)</span><span class="font30"> have facilitated matters. These coins contain the names of kings written in Greek and Kharosthi scripts. European scholars who could read the former compared the letters. For instance, the symbol for “a” could be found in both scripts for writing names such as Apollodotus. With Prinsep identifying the language of the Kharosthi inscriptions as Prakrit, it became possible to read longer inscriptions as well.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>7.3 Historical evidence from inscriptions</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">To find out how epigraphists and historians work, let us look at two Asokan inscriptions more closely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Note that the name of the ruler, Asoka, is not mentioned in the inscription (Source 10). What is used instead are titles adopted by the ruler -</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">devanampiya,</span><span class="font30"> often translated as “beloved of the gods” and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">piyadassi,</span><span class="font30"> or “pleasant to behold”. The name Asoka is mentioned in some other inscriptions, which also contain these titles. After examining all these inscriptions, and finding that they match in terms of content, style, language and palaeography, epigraphists have concluded that they were issued by the same ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">You may also have noticed that Asoka claims that earlier rulers had no arrangements to receive reports. If you consider the political history of the subcontinent prior to Asoka, do you think this statement is true? Historians have to constantly assess statements made in inscriptions to judge whether they are true, plausible or exaggerations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Did you notice that there are words within brackets? Epigraphists sometimes add these to make the meaning of sentences clear. This has to be done carefully, to ensure that the intended meaning of the author is not changed.</span></p>

<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font50">Thus speaks king Devanampiya Piyadassi:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font50">When the king Devanampiya Piyadassi had been ruling for eight years, the (country of the) Kalingas (presentday coastal Orissa) was conquered by (him).</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">One hundred and fifty thousand men were deported, a hundred thousand were killed, and many more died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">After that, now that (the country of) the Kalingas has been taken, Devanampiya (is devoted) to an intense study of Dhamma, to the love of Dhamma, and to instructing (the people) in Dhamma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This is the repentance of Devanampiya on account of his conquest of the (country of the) Kalingas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">For this is considered very painful and deplorable by Devanampiya that, while one is conquering an unconquered (country) slaughter, death and deportation of people (take place) there ...</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font31">Discuss...</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Look at Map 2 and discuss the location of Asokan inscriptions. Do you notice any patterns?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Historians have to make other assessments as well. If a king’s orders were inscribed on natural rocks near cities or important routes of communication, would passers-by have stopped to read these? Most people were probably not literate. Did everybody throughout the subcontinent understand the Prakrit used in Pataliputra? Would the orders of the king have been followed? Answers to such questions are not always easy to find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Some of these problems are evident if we look at an Asokan inscription (Source 11), which has often been interpreted as reflecting the anguish of the ruler, as well as marking a change in his attitude towards warfare. As we shall see, the situation becomes more complex once we move beyond reading the inscription at face value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While Asokan inscriptions have been found in present-day Orissa, the one depicting his anguish is missing. In other words, the inscription has not been found in the region that was conquered. What are we to make of that? Is it that the anguish of the recent conquest was too painful in the region, and therefore the ruler was unable to address the issue?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Evidence</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By now it is probably evident that there are limits to what epigraphy can reveal. Sometimes, there are technical limitations: letters are very faintly engraved, and thus reconstructions are uncertain. Also, inscriptions may be damaged or letters missing. Besides, it is not always easy to be sure about the exact meaning of the words used in inscriptions, some of which may be specific to a particular place or time. If you go through an epigraphical journal (some are listed in Timeline 2), you will realise that scholars are constantly debating and discussing alternative ways of reading inscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Although several thousand inscriptions have been discovered, not all have been deciphered, published and translated. Besides, many more inscriptions must have existed, which have not survived the ravages of time. So what is available at present is probably only a fraction of what was inscribed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">There is another, perhaps more fundamental, problem: not everything that we may consider</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">politically or economically significant was necessarily recorded in inscriptions. For instance, routine agricultural practices and the joys and sorrows of daily existence find no mention in inscriptions, which focus, more often than not, on grand, unique events. Besides, the content of inscriptions almost invariably projects the perspective of the person(s) who commissioned them. As such, they need to be juxtaposed with other perspectives so as to arrive at a better understanding of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Thus epigraphy alone does not provide a full understanding of political and economic history. Also, historians often question both old and new evidence. Scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were primarily interested in the histories of kings. From the mid-twentieth century onwards, issues such as economic change, and the ways in which different social groups emerged have assumed far more importance. Recent decades have seen a much greater preoccupation with histories of marginalised groups. This will probably lead to fresh investigations of old sources, and the development of new strategies of analysis.</span></p>
