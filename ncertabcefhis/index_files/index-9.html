<p><span class="font30">Many of the changes we are discussing were documented in detail in a report that was submitted to the British Parliament in 1813. It was the fifth of a series of reports on the administration and activities of the East India Company in India. Often referred to as the Fifth Report, it ran into 1002 pages, of which over 800 pages were appendices that reproduced petitions of zamindars and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots,</span><span class="font30"> reports of collectors from different districts, statistical tables on revenue returns, and notes on the revenue and judicial administration of Bengal and Madras (present-day Tamil Nadu) written by officials.</span></p>

These groups wanted a revocation of the Royal Charter that gave the Company this monopoly. An increasing number of private traders wanted a share in the India trade, and the industrialists of Britain were keen to open up the Indian market for British manufactures. Many political groups argued that the conquest of Bengal was benefiting only the East India Company but not the British nation as a whole. Information about Company misrule and maladministration was hotly debated in Britain and incidents of the greed and corruption of Company officials were widely publicised in the press. The British Parliament passed a series of Acts in the late eighteenth century to regulate and control Company rule in India. It forced the Company to produce regular reports on the administration of India and appointed committees to enquire into the affairs of the Company. The Fifth Report was one such report produced by a Select Committee. It became the basis of intense parliamentary debates on the nature of the East India Company’s rule in India.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">For over a century and a half, the Fifth Report has shaped our conception of what happened in rural Bengal in the late eighteenth century. The evidence contained in the Fifth Report is invaluable. But official reports like this have to be read carefully. We need to know who wrote the reports and why they were written. In fact, recent researches show that the arguments and evidence offered by the Fifth Report cannot be accepted uncritically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Researchers have carefully examined the archives of various Bengal zamindars and the local records of the districts to write about the history of colonial rule in rural Bengal. They indicate that, intent on criticising the maladministration of the company, the Fifth Report exaggerated the collapse of traditional zamindari power, as also overestimated the scale on which zamindars were losing their land. As we have seen, even when zamindaris were auctioned, zamindars were not always displaced, given the ingenious methods they used to retain their zamindaris.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Referring to the condition of zamindars and the auction of lands, the Fifth Report stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The revenue was not realised with punctuality, and lands to a considerable extent were periodically exposed to sale by auction. In the native year 1203, corresponding with 1796-97, the land advertised for sale comprehended a </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">jumma</span><span class="font50"> or assessment of </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">sicca </span><span class="font50">rupees 28,70,061, the extent of land actually sold bore a </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">jumma</span><span class="font50"> or assessment of 14,18,756, and the amount of purchase money </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">sicca</span><span class="font50"> rupees 17,90,416.

Among the defaulters were some of the oldest families of the country. Such were the rajahs of Nuddea, Rajeshaye, Bishenpore (all districts of Bengal), ... and others, the dismemberment of whose estates at the end of each succeeding year, threatened them with poverty and ruin, and in some instances presented difficulties to the revenue officers, in their efforts to preserve undiminished the amount of public assessment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Who was Buchanan?</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Francis Buchanan was a physician who came to India and served in the Bengal Medical Service (from 1794 to 1815). For a few years he was surgeon to the Governor-General of India, Lord Wellesley. During his stay in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), he organised a zoo that became the Calcutta Alipore Zoo; he was also in charge of the Botanical Gardens for a short period. On the request of the Government of Bengal, he undertook detailed surveys of the areas under the jurisdiction of the British East India Company. In 1815 he fell ill and returned to England. Upon his mother’s death, he inherited her property and assumed her family name Hamilton. So he is often called Buchanan-Hamilton.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Let us now shift our focus from the wetlands of Bengal to drier zones, from a region of settled cultivation to one where shifting agriculture was practised. You will see the changes that came about when the frontiers of the peasant economy expanded outwards, swallowing up pastures and forests in the Rajmahal hills. You will also see how these changes created a variety of conflicts within the region.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>2.1 In the hills of Rajmahal</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">In the early nineteenth century, Buchanan travelled through the Rajmahal hills. From his description, the hills appeared impenetrable, a zone where few travellers ventured, an area that signified danger. Wherever he went, people were hostile, apprehensive of officials and unwilling to talk to them. In many instances they deserted their villages and absconded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Who were these hill folk? Why were they so apprehensive of Buchanan’s visit? Buchanan’s journal gives us tantalising glimpses of these hill folk in the early nineteenth century. His journal was written as a diary of places he visited, people he encountered, and practices he saw. It raises questions in our mind, but does not always help us answer them. It tells us about a moment in time, but not about the longer history of people and places. For that historians have to turn to other records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">If we look at late-eighteenth-century revenue records, we learn that these hill folk were known as Paharias. They lived around the Rajmahal hills, subsisting on forest produce and practising shifting cultivation. They cleared patches of forest by cutting bushes and burning the undergrowth. On these patches, enriched by the potash from the ash, the Paharias grew a variety of pulses and millets for consumption. They scratched the ground lightly with hoes, cultivated the cleared land for a few years, then left it fallow so that it could recover its fertility, and moved to a new area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">From the forests they collected </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahua</span><span class="font30"> (a flower) for food, silk cocoons and resin for sale, and wood for charcoal production. The undergrowth that spread like a mat below the trees and the patches of grass that covered the lands left fallow provided pasture for cattle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">A view of a hill village in Rajmahal, painted by William Hodges, 1782</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">William Hodges was a British artist who accompanied Captain Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific (1772-75), and then came to India. In 1781 he became a friend of Augustus Cleveland, the Collector of Bhagalpur. On the Invitation of Cleveland, Hodges accompanied him to the Jangal Mahals In 1782, and painted a set of aquatints. Like many other British painters of the time, Hodges searched for the picturesque. Artists In search of the picturesque were Inspired by the Ideals of Romanticism, a tradition of thought that celebrated nature and admired Its magnificence and power. Romantics felt that to commune with nature the artist had to represent nature as an Idyll, uncorrupted by modern civilisation, discover unknown landscapes, and appreciate the sublime play of light and shade. It Is In search of this unknown that Hodges went to the Rajmahal hills. He found flat landscapes monotonous, and discovered beauty In roughness, Irregularity and variety. A landscape that colonial officials found dangerous and wild, peopled by turbulent tribes, appears In the paintings of Hodges as exotic and Idyllic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The life of the Paharias - as hunters, shifting cultivators, food gatherers, charcoal producers, silkworm rearers - was thus intimately connected to the forest. They lived in hutments within tamarind groves, and rested in the shade of mango trees. They considered the entire region as their land, the basis</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">O Look at Figs. 10.8 and | 10.9. Describe how the pictures represent the relationship between tribal people and nature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">of their identity as well as survival; and they resisted the intrusion of outsiders. Their chiefs maintained the unity of the group, settled disputes, and led the tribe in battles with other tribes and plainspeople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">With their base in the hills, the Paharias regularly raided the plains where settled agriculturists lived. These raids were necessary for survival, particularly in years of scarcity; they were a way of asserting power over settled communities; and they were a means of negotiating political relations with outsiders. The zamindars on the plains had to often purchase peace by paying a regular tribute to the hill chiefs. Traders similarly gave a small amount to the hill folk for permission to use the passes controlled by them. Once the toll was paid, the Paharia chiefs protected the traders, ensuring that their goods were not plundered by anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This negotiated peace was somewhat fragile. It broke down in the last decades of the eighteenth century when the frontiers of settled agriculture were being aggressively extended in eastern India. The British encouraged forest clearance, and zamindars and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jotedars</span><span class="font30"> turned uncultivated lands into rice fields. To the British, extension of settled agriculture was necessary to enlarge the sources of land revenue, produce crops for export, and establish the basis of a settled, ordered society. They also associated forests with wildness, and saw forest people as savage, unruly, primitive, and difficult to govern. So they felt that forests had to be cleared,</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">settled agriculture established, and forest people tamed, civilised and persuaded to give up hunting and take to plough agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As settled agriculture expanded, the area under forests and pastures contracted. This sharpened the conflict between hill folk and settled cultivators. The former began to raid settled villages with increasing regularity, carrying away food grains and cattle. Exasperated colonial officials tried desperately to control and subdue the Paharias. But they found the task difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the 1770s the British embarked on a brutal policy of extermination, hunting the Paharias down and killing them. Then, by the 1780s, Augustus Cleveland, the Collector of Bhagalpur, proposed a policy of pacification. Paharia chiefs were given an annual allowance and made responsible for the proper conduct of their men. They were expected to maintain order in their localities and discipline their own people. Many Paharia chiefs refused the allowances. Those who accepted, most often lost authority within the community. Being in the pay of the colonial government, they came to be perceived as subordinate employees or stipendiary chiefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As the pacification campaigns continued, the Paharias withdrew deep into the mountains, insulating themselves from hostile forces, and carrying on a war with outsiders. So when Buchanan travelled through the region in the winter of 1810-11 the Paharias naturally viewed him with suspicion and distrust. The experience of pacification campaigns and memories of brutal repression shaped their perception of British infiltration into the area. Every white man appeared to represent a power that was destroying their way of life and means of survival, snatching away their control over their forests and lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By this time in fact there were newer intimations of danger. Santhals were pouring into the area, clearing forests, cutting down timber, ploughing land and growing rice and cotton. As the lower hills were taken over by Santhal settlers, the Paharias receded deeper into the Rajmahal hills. If Paharia life was symbolised by the hoe, which they used for shifting cultivation, the settlers came to represent the power of the plough. The battle between the hoe and the plough was a long one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">At the end of 1810, Buchanan crossed Ganjuria Pahar, which was part of the Rajmahal ranges, passed through the rocky country beyond, and reached a village. It was an old village but the land around had been recently cleared to extend cultivation. Looking at the landscape, Buchanan found evidence of the region having been transformed through “proper application of human labour”. He wrote: “Gunjuriya is just sufficiently cultivated to show what a glorious country this might be made. I think its beauty and riches might be made equal to almost any in the universe.” The soil here was rocky but “uncommonly fine”, and nowhere had Buchanan seen finer tobacco and mustard. On enquiry he discovered that the frontiers of cultivation here had been extended by the Santhals. They had moved into this area around 1800, displaced the hill folk who lived on these lower slopes, cleared the forests and settled the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">How did the Santhals reach the Rajmahal hills? The Santhals had begun to come into Bengal around the 1780s. Zamindars hired them to reclaim land and expand cultivation, and British officials invited them to settle in the Jangal Mahals. Having failed to subdue the Paharias and transform them into settled agriculturists, the British turned to the Santhals. The Paharias refused to cut forests, resisted touching the plough, and continued to be</span></p>
<div><img src="index-257.jpg" alt="" style="width:413pt;height:252pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">turbulent. The Santhals, by contrast, appeared to be ideal settlers, clearing forests and ploughing the land with vigour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Santhals were given land and persuaded to settle in the foothills of Rajmahal. By 1832 a large area of land was demarcated as Damin-i-Koh. This was declared to be the land of the Santhals. They were to live within it, practise plough agriculture, and become settled peasants. The land grant to the Santhals stipulated that at least one-tenth of the area was to be cleared and cultivated within the first ten years. The territory was surveyed and mapped. Enclosed with boundary pillars, it was separated from both the world of the settled agriculturists of the plains and the Paharias of the hills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">After the demarcation of Damin-i-Koh, Santhal settlements expanded rapidly. From 40 Santhal villages in the area in 1838, as many as 1,473 villages had come up by 1851. Over the same period, the Santhal population increased from a mere 3,000 to over 82,000. As cultivation expanded, an increased volume of revenue flowed into the Company’s coffers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Santhal myths and songs of the nineteenth century refer very frequently to a long history of travel: they represent the Santhal past as one of continuous mobility, a tireless search for a place to settle. Here in the Damin-i-Koh their journey seemed to have come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">When the Santhals settled on the peripheries of the Rajmahal hills, the Paharias resisted but were ultimately forced to withdraw deeper into the hills. Restricted from moving down to the lower hills and valleys, they were confined to the dry interior and to the more barren and rocky upper hills. This severely affected their lives, impoverishing them in the long term. Shifting agriculture depended on the ability to move to newer and newer land and utilisation of the natural fertility of the soil. When the most fertile soils became inaccessible to them, being part of the Damin, the Paharias could not effectively sustain their mode of cultivation. When the forests of the region were cleared for cultivation the hunters amongst them also faced problems. The Santhals, by contrast, gave up their earlier life of mobility and settled down, cultivating a range of commercial crops for the market, and dealing with traders and moneylenders.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The Santhals, however, soon found that the land they had brought under cultivation was slipping away from their hands. The state was levying heavy taxes on the land that the Santhals had cleared, moneylenders </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(dikus) were</span><span class="font30"> charging them high rates of interest and taking over the land when debts remained unpaid, and zamindars were asserting control over the Damin area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By the 1850s, the Santhals felt that the time had come to rebel against zamindars, moneylenders and the colonial state, in order to create an ideal world for themselves where they would rule. It was after the Santhal Revolt (1855-56) that the Santhal Pargana was created, carving out 5,500 square miles from the districts of Bhagalpur and Birbhum. The colonial state hoped that by creating a new territory for the Santhals and imposing some special laws within it, the Santhals could be conciliated.</span></p>

The costs of the travels were borne by the East India Company since it needed the information that Buchanan was expected to collect.

<p><span class="font50">Buchanan’s journal is packed with observations like the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">About a mile farther on, (I) came to a low ledge of rocks without any evident strata; it is a small grained granite with reddish feldspar, with quartz and black mica ... More than half a mile from thence, I came to another rock not stratified, and consisting of very finegrained granite with yellowish feldspar, whitish quartz and black mica.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">As the Company consolidated its power and expanded its commerce, it looked for natural resources it could control and exploit. It surveyed landscapes and revenue sources, organised voyages of discovery, and sent its geologists and geographers, its botanists and medical men to collect information. Buchanan, undoubtedly an extraordinary observer, was one such individual. Everywhere Buchanan went, he obsessively observed the stones and rocks and the different strata and layers of soil. He searched for minerals and stones that were commercially valuable, he recorded all signs of iron ore and mica, granite and saltpetre. He carefully observed local practices of salt-making and iron-ore-mining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">When Buchanan wrote about a landscape, he most often described not just what he saw, what the landscape was like, but also how it could be transformed and made more productive - what crops could be cultivated, which trees cut down, and which ones grown. And we must remember that his vision and his priorities were different from those of the local inhabitants: his assessment of what was necessary was shaped by the commercial concerns of the Company and modern Western notions of what constituted progress. He was inevitably critical of the lifestyles of forest dwellers and felt that forests had to be turned into agricultural lands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Passing through one village in the lower Rajmahal hills, Buchanan wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The view of the country is exceedingly fine, the cultivation, especially the narrow valleys of rice winding in all directions, the cleared lands with scattered trees, and the rocky hills are in perfection; all that is wanted is some appearance of progress in the area and a vastly extended and improved cultivation, of which the country is highly susceptible. Plantations of Asan and Palas, for Tessar (Tassar silk worms) and Lac, should occupy the place of woods to as great an extent as the demand will admit; the remainder might be all cleared, and the greater part cultivated, while what is not fit for the purpose, might rear Plamira (palmyra) and Mowa </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">{mahua).</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font32" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Bombay Deccan</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">You have read about how the lives of peasants and zamindars of colonial Bengal and the Paharias and Santhals of the Rajmahal hills were changing. Now let us move across to western India, and to a later period, and explore what was happening in the countryside in the Bombay Deccan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">One way of exploring such changes is by focusing on a peasant revolt. In such climactic times rebels express their anger and fury; they rise against what they perceive to be injustice and the causes of their suffering. If we try to understand the premises of their resentment, and peel the layers of their anger, we get a glimpse of their life and experience that is otherwise hidden from us. Revolts also produce records that historians can look at. Alarmed by the actions of rebels and keen on restoring order, state authorities do not simply repress a rebellion. They try and understand it, enquire into its causes so that policies can be formulated and peace established. These enquiries produce evidence that historians can explore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Through the nineteenth century, peasants in various parts of India rose in revolt against</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;">On that day in Supa</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font50">On 16 May 1875, the District Magistrate of Poona wrote to the Police Commissioner:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">On arrival at Supa on Saturday 15 May I learnt of the disturbance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">One house of a moneylender was burnt down; about a dozen were forcibly broken into and completely gutted of their content. Account papers, bonds, grains, country cloth were burnt in the street where heaps of ashes are still to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The chief constable apprehended 50 persons. Stolen property worth Rs 2000 was recovered. The estimated loss is over Rs 25,000. Moneylenders claim it is over 1 lakh.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>3.1 Account books are burnt</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The movement began at Supa, a large village in Poona (present-day Pune) district. It was a market centre where many shopkeepers and moneylenders lived. On 12 Mayl875, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> from surrounding rural areas gathered and attacked the shopkeepers, demanding their </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">baht khatas</span><span class="font30"> (account books) and debt bonds. They burnt the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">khatas,</span><span class="font30"> looted grain shops, and in some cases set fire to the houses of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sahukars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">From Poona the revolt spread to Ahmednagar. Then over the next two months it spread even further, over an area of 6,500 square km. More than thirty villages were affected. Everywhere the pattern was the same: </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sahukars</span><span class="font30"> were attacked, account books burnt and debt bonds destroyed. Terrified of peasant attacks, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sahukars</span><span class="font30"> fled the villages, very often leaving their property and belongings behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As the revolt spread, British officials saw the spectre of 1857 (see Chapter 11). Police posts were established in villages to frighten rebellious peasants into submission. Troops were quickly called in; 951 people were arrested, and many convicted. But it took several months to bring the countryside under control.</span></p>

If any Government officer happens to approach the villages where the above is taking place, the spies give intimation to the offenders and the latter disperse in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Why the burning of bonds and deeds? Why this revolt? What does it tell us about the Deccan countryside and about agrarian changes under colonial rule? Let us look at this longer history of changes over the nineteenth century.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>3.2 A new revenue system</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">As British rule expanded from Bengal to other parts of India, new systems of revenue were imposed. The Permanent Settlement was rarely extended to any region beyond Bengal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Why was this so? One reason was that after 1810, agricultural prices rose, increasing the value of harvest produce, and enlarging the income of the Bengal zamindars. Since the revenue demand was fixed under the Permanent Settlement, the colonial state could not claim any share of this enhanced income. Keen on expanding its financial resources, the colonial government had to think of ways to maximise its land revenue. So in territories annexed in the nineteenth century, temporary revenue settlements were made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">There were other reasons too. When officials devise policies, their thinking is deeply shaped by economic theories they are familiar with. By the 1820s, the economist David Ricardo was a celebrated figure in England. Colonial officials had learnt Ricardian ideas during their college years. In Maharashtra when British officials set about formulating the terms of the early settlement in the 1820s, they operated with some of these ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">According to Ricardian ideas, a land owner should have a claim only to the “average rent” that prevailed at a given time. When the land yielded more than this “average rent”, the landowner had a surplus that the state needed to tax. If tax was not levied, cultivators were likely to turn into rentiers, and their surplus income was unlikely to be productively invested in the improvement of the land. Many British officials in India thought that the history of Bengal confirmed Ricardo’s theory. There the zamindars seemed to have turned into rentiers, leasing out land and living on the rental incomes. It was therefore necessary, the British officials now felt, to have a different system.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Rentier</span><span class="font30"> is a term used to designate people who live on rental income from property.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The revenue system that was introduced in the Bombay Deccan came to be known as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryotwari </span><span class="font30">settlement. Unlike the Bengal system, the revenue was directly settled with the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryot.</span><span class="font30"> The average income from different types of soil was estimated, the revenue-paying capacity of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryot</span><span class="font30"> was assessed and a proportion of it fixed as the share of the state. The lands were resurveyed every 30 years and the revenue rates increased. Therefore the revenue demand was no longer permanent.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>3.3 Revenue demand and peasant debt</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The first revenue settlement in the Bombay Deccan was made in the 1820s. The revenue that was demanded was so high that in many places peasants deserted their villages and migrated to new regions. In areas of poor soil and fluctuating rainfall the problem was particularly acute. When rains failed and harvests were poor, peasants found it impossible to pay the revenue. However, the collectors in charge of revenue collection were keen on demonstrating their efficiency and pleasing their superiors. So they went about extracting payment with utmost severity. When someone failed to pay, his crops were seized and a fine was imposed on the whole village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By the 1830s the problem became more severe. Prices of agricultural products fell sharply after 1832 and did not recover for over a decade and a half. This meant a further decline in peasants’ income. At the same time the countryside was devastated by a famine that struck in the years 1832-34. One-third of the cattle of the Deccan were killed, and half the human population died. Those who survived had no agricultural stocks to see them through the crisis. Unpaid balances of revenue mounted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">How did cultivators live through such years? How did they pay the revenue, procure their consumption needs, purchase their ploughs and cattle, or get their children married?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Inevitably, they borrowed. Revenue could rarely be paid without a loan from a moneylender. But once a loan was taken, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryot</span><span class="font30"> found it difficult to pay it back. As debt mounted, and loans remained unpaid, peasants’ dependence on moneylenders increased. They now needed loans even to buy their everyday needs and meet their production expenditure. By the 1840s, officials were finding evidence of alarming levels of peasant indebtedness everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By the mid-1840s there were signs of an economic recovery of sorts. Many British officials had begun to realise that the settlements of the 1820s had been harsh. The revenue demanded was exorbitant, the system rigid, and the peasant economy on the verge of collapse. So the revenue demand was moderated to encourage peasants to expand cultivation. After 1845 agricultural prices recovered steadily. Cultivators were now extending their acreage, moving into new areas, and transforming pastureland into cultivated fields. But to expand cultivation peasants needed more ploughs and cattle. They needed money to buy seeds and land. For all this they had to turn once again to moneylenders for loans.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>3.4 Then came the cotton boom</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Before the 1860s, three-fourths of raw cotton imports into Britain came from America. British cotton manufacturers had for long been worried about this dependence on American supplies. What would happen if this source was cut off? Troubled by this question, they eagerly looked for alternative sources of supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In 1857 the Cotton Supply Association was founded in Britain, and in 1859 the Manchester Cotton Company was formed. Their objective was “to encourage cotton production in every part of the world</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">suited for its growth”. India was seen as a country that could supply cotton to Lancashire if the American supply dried up. It possessed suitable soil, a climate favourable to cotton cultivation, and cheap labour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, a wave of panic spread through cotton circles in Britain. Raw cotton imports from America fell to less than three per cent of the normal: from over 2,000,000 bales (of 400 lbs each) in 1861 to 55,000 bales in 1862. Frantic messages were sent to India and elsewhere to increase cotton exports to Britain. In Bombay, cotton merchants visited the cotton districts to assess supplies and encourage cultivation. As cotton prices soared (see Fig. 10.15), export merchants in Bombay were keen to secure as much cotton as possible to meet the British demand. So they gave advances to urban </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sahukars </span><span class="font30">who in turn extended credit to those rural moneylenders who promised to secure the produce. When there is a boom in the market credit flows easily, for those who give out loans feel secure about recovering their money.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29">When cotton supplies from America were cut off during the Civil War, Britain hoped that India would supply all the cotton that British industries needed. It began assessing the supply, examining the quality of cotton and studying the methods of production and marketing. This interest was reflected in the pages of the </span><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrated London News.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">These developments had a profound impact on the Deccan countryside. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> in the Deccan villages suddenly found access to seemingly limitless credit. They were being given Rs 100 as advance for every acre they planted with cotton. </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Sahukars </span><span class="font30">were more than willing to extend long-term loans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While the American crisis continued, cotton production in the Bombay Deccan expanded.</span></p>
<div><img src="index-265.jpg" alt="" style="width:277pt;height:167pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Between 1860 and 1864 cotton acreage doubled. By 1862 over 90 per cent of cotton imports into Britain were coming from India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">But these boom years did not bring prosperity to all cotton producers. Some rich peasants did gain, but for the large majority, cotton expansion meant heavier debt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">While the boom lasted, cotton merchants in India had visions of capturing the world market in raw cotton, permanently displacing America. The editor of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Bombay Gazette</span><span class="font30"> had asked in 1861, “What can prevent India from supplanting the Slave States (of U.S.A.) as the feeder of Lancashire?” By 1865 these dreams were over. As the Civil War ended, cotton production in America revived and Indian cotton exports to Britain steadily declined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Export merchants and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sahukars</span><span class="font30"> in Maharashtra were no longer keen on extending long-term credit. They could see the demand for Indian cotton fall and cotton prices slide downwards. So they decided to close down their operations, restrict their advances to peasants, and demand repayment of outstanding debts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While credit dried up, the revenue demand increased. The first revenue settlement, as we have seen, was in the 1820s and 1830s. Now it was time for the next. And in the new settlement, the demand was increased dramatically: from 50 to 100 per cent. How could </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> pay this inflated demand at a time when prices were falling and cotton fields disappearing? Yet again they had to turn to the moneylender. But the moneylender now refused loans.

This was meant to limit the moneylender’s exactions and defined what could be counted as “fair interest”. Under colonial rule this norm broke down. In one of the many cases investigated by the Deccan Riots Commission, the moneylender had charged over Rs 2,000 as interest on a loan of Rs 100.

<p><span class="font50">When debts mounted the peasant was unable to pay back the loan to the moneylender. He had no option but to give over all his possessions - land, carts, and animals - to the moneylender. But without animals he could not continue to cultivate. So he took land on rent and animals on hire. He now had to pay for the animals which had originally belonged to him. He had to sign a deed of hire stating very clearly that these animals and carts did not belong to him. In cases of conflict, these deeds could be enforced through the court.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> came to see the moneylender as devious and deceitful. They complained of moneylenders manipulating laws and forging accounts. In 1859 the British passed a Limitation Law that stated that the loan bonds signed between moneylenders and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> would have validity for only three years. This law was meant to check the accumulation of interest over time. The moneylender, however, turned the law around, forcing the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryot</span><span class="font30"> to sign a new bond every three years. When a new bond was signed, the unpaid balance - that is, the original loan and the accumulated interest - was entered as the principal on which a new set of interest charges was calculated. In petitions that the Deccan Riots Commission collected, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> described how this process worked (see Source 10) and how moneylenders used a variety of other means to short-change the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryot:</span><span class="font30"> they refused to give receipts when loans were repaid, entered fictitious figures in bonds, acquired the peasants’ harvest at low prices, and ultimately took over peasants’ property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Deeds and bonds appeared as symbols of the new oppressive system. In the past such deeds had been rare. The British, however, were suspicious of transactions based on informal understanding, as was common in the past. The terms of transactions, they believed, had to be clearly, unambiguously and categorically stated in contracts, deeds and bonds, and regulated by law. Unless the deed or contract was legally enforceable, it had no value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Over time, peasants came to associate the misery of their lives with the new regime of bonds and deeds. They were made to sign and put thumb impressions on documents, but they did not know what they were actually signing. They had no idea of the clauses that moneylenders inserted in the bonds. They feared the written word. But they had no choice because to survive they needed loans, and moneylenders were unwilling to give loans without legal bonds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">When the revolt spread in the Deccan, the Government of Bombay was initially unwilling to see it as anything serious. But the Government of India, worried by the memory of 1857, pressurised the Government of Bombay to set up a commission of enquiry to investigate into the causes of the riots. The commission produced a report that was presented to the British Parliament in 1878.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font31">O Discuss...</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Check what rates of interest are charged in the region where you live at present. Find out whether these rates have changed over the last 50 years. Is there a variation in the rates paid by different groups of people? What are the reasons for the differences?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">This report, referred to as the Deccan Riots Report, provides historians with a range of sources for the study of the riot. The commission held enquiries in the districts where the riots spread, recorded statements of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots, sahukars</span><span class="font30"> and eyewitnesses, compiled statistical data on revenue rates, prices and interest rates in different regions, and collated the reports sent by district collectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In looking at such sources we have to again remember that they are official sources and reflect official concerns and interpretations of events. The Deccan Riots Commission, for instance, was specifically asked to judge whether the level of government revenue demand was the cause of the revolt. And after presenting all the evidence, the commission reported that the government demand was not the cause of peasant anger. It was the moneylenders who were to blame. This argument is found very frequently in colonial records. This shows that there was a persistent reluctance on the part of the colonial government to admit that popular discontent was ever on account of government action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Official reports, thus, are invaluable sources for the reconstruction of history. But they have to be always read with care and juxtaposed with evidence culled from newspapers, unofficial accounts, legal records and, where possible, oral sources.</span></p>
