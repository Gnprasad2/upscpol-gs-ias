<p><span class="font30">In this chapter we shall go on </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font30"> long journey across a thousand years to read about philosophers and their attempts to understand the world they inhabited. We will also see how their ideas were compiled as oral and written texts as well as expressed in architecture and sculpture. These are indicative of the enduring influence these thinkers had on people. While we will be focusing on Buddhism, it is important to remember that this tradition did not develop in isolation - there were several other traditions, each engaged in debares and dialogues with the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The sources that historians use to reconstruct this exciting world of ideas and beliefs include Buddhist, Jaina and Brahmanical texts, as well as a large and impressive body of material remains including monuments and inscriptions. Among the best preserved monuments of the time is the stupa at Sanchi which is a major focus in this chapter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font51">The most wonderful ancient buildings in the state of Bhopal are at Sanchi Kanakhera, a small village under the brow of a hill some 20 miles north-east of Bhopal which we visited yesterday. We inspected the stone sculptures and statues of the Buddha and an ancient gateway ... The ruins appear to be the object of great interest to European gentlemen. Major Alexander Cunningham ... stayed several weeks in this neighbourhood and examined these ruins most carefully. He took drawings of the place, deciphered the inscription, and bored shafts down these domes. The results of his investigations were described by him in an English work ...</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Nineteenth-century Europeans were very interested in the stupa at Sanchi. In fact, the French sought Shahjehan Begum’s permission to take away the eastern gateway, which was the best preserved, to be displayed in a museum in France. For a while some Englishmen also wanted to do the same, but fortunately both the French and the English were satisfied with carefully prepared plaster-cast copies and the original remained at the site, part of the Bhopal state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The rulers of Bhopal, Shahjehan Begum and her successor Sultan Jehan Begum, provided money for the preservation of the ancient site. No wonder then that John Marshall dedicated his important volumes on Sanchi to Sultan Jehan. She funded the museum that was built there as well as the guesthouse where he lived and wrote the volumes. She also funded the publication of the volumes. So if the stupa complex has survived, it is in no small measure due to wise decisions, and to good luck in escaping the eyes of railway contractors, builders, and those looking for finds to carry away to the museums of Europe. One of the most important Buddhist centres, the discovery of Sanchi has vastly transformed our understanding of early Buddhism. Today it stands testimony to the successful restoration and preservation of a key archaeological site by the Archaeological Survey of India.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29">If you travel from Delhi to Bhopal by train, you will see the majestic stupa complex on top of a hill, crowning it as it were. If you request the guard he will stop the train at the little station of Sanchi for two minutes - enough time for you to get down. As you climb up the hill you can see the complex of structures: a large mound and other monuments including a temple built in the fifth century.</span></p>

There is a fascinating story that we can uncover at Sanchi for which we must combine information from texts, sculpture, architecture and inscriptions. Let us begin by exploring the background of the early Buddhist tradition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Sacrifices and debates</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The mid-first millennium bce is often regarded as a turning point in world history: it saw the emergence of thinkers such as Zarathustra in Iran, Kong Zi in China, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle in Greece, and Mahavira and Gautama Buddha, among many others, in India. They tried to understand the mysteries of existence and the relationship between human beings and the cosmic order. This was also the time when new kingdoms and cities were developing and social and economic life was changing in a variety of ways in the Ganga valley (Chapters 2 and 3). These thinkers attempted to understand these developments as well.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>2.1 The sacrificial tradition</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">There were several pre-existing traditions of thought, religious belief and practice, including the early Vedic tradition, known from the Jdgoeda, compiled between c. 1500 and 1000 bce. The /dgrcdu consists of hymns in praise of a variety of deities, especially Agni, Indra and Soma. Many of these hymns were chanted when sacrifices were performed, where people prayed for cattle, sons, good health, long life, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">At first, sacrifices were performed collectively. Later (c. 1000 bce-500 bce onwards) some were performed by the heads of households for the wellbeing of the domestic unit. More elaborate sacrifices, such as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">rajasuya</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ashvamedha</span><span class="font30">, were performed by chiefs and kings who depended on Brahmana priests to conduct the ritual.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>2.2 New questions</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Many ideas found in the Upanishads (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> sixth century bce onwards) show that people were curious about the meaning of life, the possibility of life after death,</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">and rebirth. Was rebirth due to past actions? Such issues were hotly debated. Thinkers were concerned with understanding and expressing the nature of the ultimate reality. And others, outside the Vedic tradition, asked whether or not there even was a single ultimate reality. People also began speculating on the significance of the sacrificial tradition.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>2.3 Debates and discussions</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">We get a glimpse of lively discussions and debates from Buddhist texts, which mention as many as 64 sects or schools of thought. Teachers travelled from place to place, trying to convince one another as well as laypersons, about the validity of their philosophy or the way they understood the world. Debates took place in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kutagarashala</span><span class="font30"> - literally, a hut with a pointed roof - or in groves where travelling mendicants halted. If a philosopher succeeded in convincing one of his rivals, the followers of the latter also became his disciples. So support for any particular sect could grow and shrink over time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font32" style="font-variant:small-caps;">kO</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Many of these teachers, including Mahavira and the Buddha, questioned the authority of the Vedas. They also emphasised individual agency - suggesting that men and women could strive to attain liberation from the trials and tribulations of worldly existence. This was in marked contrast to the Brahmanical position, wherein, as we have seen, an individual’s existence was thought to be determined by his or her birth in a specific caste or gender.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Verses from the Upanishads</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Here are two verses from the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Chhandogya Upanishad,</span><span class="font50"> a text composed in Sanskrit </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font50"> sixth century </span><span class="font30" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bce:</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The nature of the self</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This self of mine within the heart, is smaller than paddy or barley or mustard or millet or the kernel of a seed of millet. This self of mine within the heart is greater than the earth, greater than the intermediate space, greater than heaven, greater than these worlds.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>The true sacrifice</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This one (the wind) that blows, this is surely a sacrifice ... While moving, it sanctifies all this; therefore it is indeed a sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>How Buddhist texts were prepared and preserved</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The Buddha (and other teachers) taught orally - through discussion and debate. Men and women (perhaps children as well) attended these discourses and discussed what they heard. None of the Buddha’s speeches were written down during his lifetime. After his death (c. fifth-fourth century bce</span><span class="font50" style="font-variant:small-caps;">)</span><span class="font50"> his teachings were compiled by his disciples at a council of “elders” or senior monks at Vesali (Pali for Vaishali in present-day Bihar). These compilations were known as TTp/taka - literally, three baskets to hold different types of texts. They were first transmitted orally and then written and classified according to length as well as subject matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Vjnaye Pitaka</span><span class="font50"> included rules and regulations for those who joined the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">sanghs</span><span class="font50"> or monastic order; the Buddha’s teachings were included in the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Sutte Piteka;</span><span class="font50"> and the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">AbhidhEmma Ptteka</span><span class="font50"> dealt with philosophical matters. Each pftaka comprised a number of individual texts. Later, commentaries were written on these texts by Buddhist scholars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">As Buddhism travelled to new regions such as Sri Lanka, other texts such as the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Diaavamsa</span><span class="font50"> (literally, the chronicle of the island) and </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Mahmvemse</span><span class="font50"> (the great chronicle) were written,^ujtaining^gional histories of Buddhism. Many of these works contained biographies of the Buddha. Some of the oldest texts are in Pali, while later compositions are in Sanskrit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">When Buddhism spread to East A$ia, pilgrims such as Fa Xian and Xuan Zang travelled all the way from China to India in search of texts. These they took back to their own country, where they were translated by scholars. Indian Buddhist teacher^also travelled to faraway places, carrying texts to disseminate the teachings of the Buddha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Buddhist texts were preserved in manuscripts for several centuries in monasteries in different parts of Asia. Modern translations have been prepared from Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan texts.</span></p><img src="index-79.jpg" alt="" style="width:356pt;height:187pt;">

<p><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Fatalists and materialists?</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Here is an excerpt from the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Sutta Pitaka,</span><span class="font50"> describing a conversation between king Ajatasattu, the ruler of Magadha, and the Buddha:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">On one occasion King Ajatasattu visited the Buddha and described what another teacher, named Makkhali Gosala, had told him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">“Though the wise should hope, by this virtue ... by this penance I will gain karma ... and the fool should by the same means hope to gradually rid himself of his karma, neither of them can do it. Pleasure and pain, measured out as it were, cannot be altered in the course of </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">samsara</span><span class="font50"> (transmigration). It can neither be lessened or increased... just as a ball of string will when thrown unwind to its full length, so fool and wise alike will take their course and make an end of sorrow.”</span></p>
<div><img src="index-80.jpg" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font50">And this is what a philosopher named Ajita Kesakambalin taught:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">“There is no such thing, O king, as alms or sacrifice, or offerings ... there is no such thing as this </span><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">world </span><span class="font50">or the next ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">A human being is made up of the four elements. When he dies the earthy in him returns to the earth, the fluid to water, the heat to firsC“the windy to air, and his senses pass into space^v</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The talk of gifts is a doctrine of fools, an empty lie ... fools and wise alike are cut off and perish. They do not survive after death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The first teacher belonged to the tradition of the Ajivikas. They have often been described as fatalists: those who believe that everything is predetermined. The second teacher belonged to the tradition of the Lokayatas, usually described as materialists. Texts from these traditions have not survived, so we know about them only from the works of other traditions.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">

<p><span class="font40" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Message of Mahavira</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The basic philosophy of the Jainas was already in existence in north India before the birth of Vardhamana, who came to be known as Mahavira, in the sixth century bce. According to Jaina tradition, Mahavira was preceded by 23 other teachers or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">tirthankaras</span><span class="font30"> - literally, those who guide men and women across the river of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The most important idea in Jainism is that the entire world is animated: even stones, rocks and water have life. Non-injury to living beings, especially to humans, animals, plants and insects, is central to Jaina philosophy. In fact the principle of ahimsa, emphasised within Jainism, has left its mark on Indian thinking as a whole. According to Jaina teachings, the cycle of birth and rebirth is shaped through karma. Asceticism and penance are required to free oneself from the cycle of karma. This can be achieved only by renouncing the world; therefore,</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">monastic existence is a necessary condition of salvation. Jaina monks and nuns took five vows: to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">Source 4</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">abstain from killing, stealing and lying; to observe celibacy; and to abstain from possessing property.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The world beyond the palace</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Just as the Buddha’s teachings were compiled by his followers, the teachings of Mahavira were also recorded by his disciples. These were often in the form of stories, which could appeal to ordinary people. Here is one example, from a Prakrit text known as the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Uttaradhyayana Sutta,</span><span class="font50"> describing how a queen named Kamalavati tried to persuade her husband to renounce the world:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">If the whole world and all its treasures were yours, you would not be satisfied, nor would all this be able to save you. When you die, O king and leave all things behind, </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">dhamma</span><span class="font50"> alone, and nothing else, will save you. As a bird dislikes the cage, so do I dislike (the world). I shall live as a nun without offspring, without desire, without the love of gain, and without hatred ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Those who have enjoyed pleasures and renounced them, move about like the wind, and go wherever they please, unchecked like birds in their flight ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Leave your large kingdom ... abandon what pleases the senses, be without attachment and property, then practise severe penance, being firm of energy ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font29">Which of the arguments advanced by the queen do you find most convincing?</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Gradually, Jainism spread to many parts of India. Like the Buddhists, Jaina scholars produced a wealth of literature in a variety of languages - Prakrit, Sanskrit and Tamil. For centuries, manuscripts of these texts were carefully preserved in libraries attached to temples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Some of the earliest stone sculptures associated with religious traditions were produced by devotees of the Jaina </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">tirthankaras,</span><span class="font30"> and have been recovered from several sites throughout the subcontinent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">One of the most influential teachers of the time was the Buddha. Over the centuries, his message spread across the subcontinent and beyond - through Central Asia to China, Korea and Japan, and through Sri Lanka, across the seas to Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">How do we know about the Buddha’s teachings? These have been reconstructed by carefully editing, translating and analysing the Buddhist texts mentioned earlier. Historians have also tried to reconstruct details of his life from hagiographies. Many of these were written down at least a century after the time of the Buddha, in an attempt to preserve memories of the great teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">According to these traditions, Siddhartha, as the Buddha was named at birth, was the son of a chief</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">of the Sakya clan. He had a sheltered upbringing within the palace, insulated from the harsh realities of life. One day he persuaded his charioteer to take him into the city. His first journey into the world outside was traumatic. He was deeply anguished when he saw an old man, a sick man and a corpse. He realised in that moment that the decay and destruction of the human body was inevitable. He also saw a homeless mendicant, who, it seemed to him, had come to terms with old age, disease and death, and found peace. Siddhartha decided that he too would adopt the same path. Soon after, he left the palace and set out in search of his own truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Siddhartha explored several paths including bodily mortification which led him to a situation of near death. Abandoning these extreme methods, he meditated for several days and finally attained enlightenment. After this he came to be known as the Buddha or the Enlightened One. For the rest of his life, he taught </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">atormma</span><span class="font30"> or the path of righteous living.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The Buddha’s teachings have been reconstructed from stories, found mainly in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Sutta Pitaka</span><span class="font30">. Although some stories describe his miraculous powers, others suggest that the Buddha tried to convince people through reason and persuasion rather than through displays of supernatural power. For instance, when a grief-stricken woman whose child had died came to the Buddha, he gently convinced her about the inevitability of death rather than bring her son back to life. These stories were narrated in the language spoken by ordinary people so that these could be easily understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">According to Buddhist philosophy, the world is transient (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">anicca)</span><span class="font30"> and constantly changing: it is also soulless </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(anatta)</span><span class="font30"> as there is nothing permanent or eternal in it. Within this transient world, sorrow </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(dukkha)</span><span class="font30"> is intrinsic to human existence. It is by following the path of moderation between severe penance and self-indulgence that human beings can rise above these worldly troubles. In the earliest forms of Buddhism, whether or not god existed was irrelevant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">This is an excerpt from the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Sutta Pitaka,</span><span class="font50"> and contains the advice given by the Buddha to a wealthy householder named Sigala:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">In five ways should a master look after his servants and employees ... by assigning them work according to their strength, by supplying them with food and wages, by tending them in sickness; by sharing delicacies with them and by granting leave at times ...</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Do you notice any similarities and differences?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The Buddha regarded the social world as the creation of humans rather than of divine origin. Therefore, he advised kings and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gahapatis</span><span class="font30"> (see also Chapter 2) to be humane and ethical. Individual effort was expected to transform social relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Buddha emphasised individual agency and righteous action as the means to escape from the cycle of rebirth and attain self-realisation and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nibbana,</span><span class="font30"> literally the extinguishing of the ego and desire - and thus end the cycle of suffering for those who renounced the world. According to Buddhist tradition, his last words to his followers were: “Be lamps unto yourselves as all of you must work out your own liberation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Soon there grew a body of disciples of the Buddha and he founded a </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sangha,</span><span class="font30"> an organisation of monks who too became teachers of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">dhamma.</span><span class="font30"> These monks lived simply, possessing only the essential requisites for survival, such as a bowl to receive food once a day from the laity. As they lived on alms, they were known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">bhikkhus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Initially, only men were allowed into the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sangha, </span><span class="font30">but later women also came to be admitted. According to Buddhist texts, this was made possible through the mediation of Ananda, one of the Buddha’s dearest disciples, who persuaded him to allow women into the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sangha.</span><span class="font30"> The Buddha’s foster mother, Mahapajapati Gotami was the first woman to be ordained as a bhikkhuni. Many women who entered the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mangha</span><span class="font30"> became teachers of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">dhamma</span><span class="font30"> and went on to become </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">thews,</span><span class="font30"> or respected women who had attained liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Buddha’s followers came from many social groups. They included kings, wealthy men and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gahapatiSv</span><span class="font30"> and also humbler folk: workers, slaves and craftspeople. Once with in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gaagha</span><span class="font30">, all were regarded as equal, having shed their earlier social identities on becoming </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">bhikkhus</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">bhikkhunis</span><span class="font30">. The internal functioning of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sangha</span><span class="font30"> was based on the traditions of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ganas</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sanghas,</span><span class="font30"> where consensus was arrived at through discussions.

Punna, a </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">das</span><span class="font50"> or slave woman, went to the river each morning to fetch water for her master’s household. There she would daily see a Brahmana performing bathing rituals. One morning she spoke to him. The following are verses composed by Punna, recording her conversation with the Brahmana:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">I am a water carrier:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Even in the cold</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">So what are you afraid of Brahmana, That makes you go down to the water (Though) your limbs shake with the bitter cold?</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The Brahmana replied:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">I am doing good to prevent evil; anyone young or old who has done something bad is freed by washing in water.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">There were other places too that were regarded as sacred. This was because relics of the Buddha such as his bodily remains or objects used by him were buried there. These were mounds known as stupas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The tradition of erecting stupas may have been pre-Buddhist, but they came to be associated with Buddhism. Since they contained relics regarded as sacred, the entire stupa came to be venerated as an emblem of both the Buddha and Buddhism. According to a Buddhist text known as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ashokavadana,</span><span class="font30"> Asoka distributed portions of the Buddha’s relics to every important town and ordered the construction of stupas over them. By the second century bce a number of stupas, including those at Bharhut, Sanchi and Sarnath (Map 1), had been built.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>7.2 How were stupas built</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Inscriptions found on the railings and pillars of stupas record donations made for building and decorating them. Some donations were made by kings such as the Satavahanas; others were made by guilds, such as that of the ivory workers who financed part of one of the gateways at Sanchi. Hundreds of donations were made by women and men who mention their names, sometimes adding the name of the place from where they came, as well as their occupations and names of their relatives. </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Bhikkhus</span><span class="font30"> and bhikkhunis also contributed towards building these monuments.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>7.3 The structure of the stupa</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The stupa (a Sanskrit word meaning a heap) originated as a simple semi-circular mound of earth, later called </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">anda</span><span class="font30">. Gradually, it evolved into a more complex structure, balancing round and square shapes. Above the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">anda</span><span class="font30"> was the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">harmika</span><span class="font30">, a balconylike structure that represented the abode of the gods.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">A votive inscription from Sanchi </span><span class="font29">Hundreds of similar inscriptions have also been found at Bharhut and Amaravati.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Arising from the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">harmika</span><span class="font30"> was a mast called the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">yashti, </span><span class="font30">often surmounted by a </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">chhatri</span><span class="font30"> or umbrella. Around the mound was a railing, separating the sacred space from the secular world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The early stupas at Sanchi and Bharhut were plain except for the stone railings, which resembled a bamboo or wooden fence, and the gateways, which were richly carved and installed at the four cardinal points. Worshippers entered through the eastern gateway and walked around the mound in a clockwise direction keeping the mound on the right, imitating the sun’s course through the sky. Later, the mound of the stupas came to be elaborately carved with niches and sculptures as at Amaravati, and Shah-ji-ki-Dheri in Peshawar (Pakistan).</span></p>

<p><span class="font40" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>The Fate of Amaravati and Sanchi</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Each stupa has a history of its own - as we have just seen, some of these are histories of how they were built. But there are histories of discoveries as well, and let us now turn to some of these. In 1796, a local raja who wanted to build a temple stumbled upon the ruins of the stupa at Amaravati. He decided to use the stone, and thought there might be some treasure buried in what seemed to be a hill. Some years later, a British official named Colin Mackenzie (see also Chapter 7) visited the site. Although he found several pieces of sculpture and </span><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">Fig. 4.11</span><span class="font30"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made detailed drawings of them, these reports were</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font29">Notice the vibrant sculpture.</span></p><img src="index-90.jpg" alt="" style="width:243pt;height:395pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">In 1854, Walter Elliot, the commissioner of Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), visited Amaravati and collected several sculpture panels and took them away to Madras. (These came to be called the Elliot marbles after him.) He also discovered the remains of the western gateway and came to the conclusion that the structure at Amaravati was one of the largest and most magnificent Buddhist stupas ever built. By the 1850s, some of the slabs from Amaravati had begun to be taken to different places: to the Asiatic Society of Bengal at Calcutta, to the India Office in Madras and some even to London. It was not unusual to find these sculptures adorning the gardens of British administrators.

<p><span class="font30">One of the few men who had a different point of view was an archaeologist named H.H. Cole.

<p><span class="font30">Art historians had to acquire familiarity with hagiographies of the Buddha in order to understand Buddhist sculpture. According to hagiographies, the Buddha attained enlightenment while meditating under a tree. Many early sculptors did not show the Buddha in human form - instead, they showed his presence through symbols. The empty seat (Fig. 4.14) was meant to indicate the meditation of the Buddha, and the stupa (Fig. 4.15) was meant to represent the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahaparinidbana.</span><span class="font30"> Another frequently used symbol was the wheel (Fig. 4.16). This stood for the first sermon of the Buddha, delivered at Sarnath. As is obvious, such sculptures cannot be understood literally - for instance, the tree does not stand</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Other sculptures at Sanchi were perhaps not directly inspired by Buddhist ideas. These include beautiful women swinging from the edge of the gateway, holding onto a tree (Fig.4.17). Initially, scholars were a bit intrigued about this image, which seemed to have little to do with renunciation. However, after examining other literary traditions, they realised that it could be a representation of what is described in Sanskrit as a </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">shalabhanjika.</span><span class="font30"> According to popular belief, this was a woman whose touch caused trees to flower and bear fruit. It is likely that this was regarded as an auspicious symbol and integrated into the decoration of the stupa. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">shalabhanjika</span><span class="font30"> motif suggests that many people who turned to Buddhism enriched it with their own pre-Buddhist and even non-Buddhist beliefs, practices and ideas. Some of the recurrent motifs in the sculpture at Sanchi were evidently derived from these traditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">There are other images as well. For instance, some of the finest depictions of animals are found there. These animals include elephants, horses, monkeys and cattle. While the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jatakas </span><span class="font30">contain several animal stories that are depicted at Sanchi, it is likely that many of these animals were carved to create lively scenes to draw viewers. Also, animals were often used as symbols of human attributes. Elephants, for example, were depicted to signify strength and wisdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">While stone sculpture survives the ravages of time and is therefore most easily available to the historian, other visual means of communication, including paintings, were also used in the past. Those that have survived best are on walls of caves, of which those from Ajanta (Maharashtra) are the most famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The paintings at Ajanta depict stories from the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Jatakas. </span><span class="font50">These include depictions of courtly life, processions, men and women at work, and festivals. The artists used the technique of shading to give a three-dimensional quality. Some of the paintings are extremely naturalistic.</span></p>

Interestingly, one of the earliest modern art historians, James Fergusson, considered Sanchi to be a centre of tree and serpent worship. He was not familiar with Buddhist literature - most of which had not yet been translated - and arrived at this conclusion by studying only the images on their own.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Buddhism</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By the first century ce, there is evidence of changes in Buddhist ideas and practices. Early Buddhist teachings had given great importance to self-effort in achieving </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nibbana.</span><span class="font30"> Besides, the Buddha was regarded as a human being who attained enlightenment and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nibbana</span><span class="font30"> through his own efforts. However, gradually the idea of a saviour emerged. It was believed that he was the one who could ensure salvation. Simultaneously, the concept of the Bodhisatta also developed. Bodhisattas were perceived as deeply compassionate beings who accumulated merit through their efforts but used this not to attain </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nibbana</span><span class="font30"> and thereby abandon the world, but to help others. The worship of images of the Buddha and Bodhisattas became an important part of this tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This new way of thinking was called Mahayana - literally, the “great vehicle”. Those who adopted these beliefs described the older tradition as Hinayana or the “lesser vehicle”.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Hinayana or Theravada?</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Supporters of Mahayana regarded other Buddhists as followers of Hinayana. However, followers of the older tradition described themselves as </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">theravadins</span><span class="font50">, that is, those who followed the path of old, respected teachers, the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">theras</span><span class="font50">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Hinduism. These included Vaishnavism (a form of Hinduism within which Vishnu was worshipped as the principal deity) and Shaivism (a tradition within which Shiva was regarded as the chief god), in which there was growing emphasis on the worship of a chosen deity. In such worship the bond between the devotee and the god was visualised as one of love and devotion, or bhakti.</span></p>
<div><img src="index-100.jpg" alt="" style="width:282pt;height:445pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">In the case of Vaishnavism, cults developed around the various avatars or incarnations of the deity. Ten avatars were recognised within the tradition. These were forms that the deity was believed to have assumed in order to save the world whenever it was threatened by disorder and destruction because of the dominance of evil forces. It is likely that different avatars were popular in different parts of the country. Recognising each of these local deities as a form of Vishnu was one way of creating a more unified religious tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Some of these forms were represented in sculptures, as were other deities. Shiva, for instance, was symbolised by the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">linga, </span><span class="font30">although he was occasionally represented in human form too. AU such representations depicted a complex set of ideas about the deities and their attributes through symbols such as headdresses, ornaments and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ayudhas -</span><span class="font30"> weapons or auspicious objects the deities hold in their hands -how they are seated, etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">have to be familiar with the stories behind them -many of which are contained in the Puranas, compiled by Brahmanas (by about the middle of the first millennium ce). They contained much that had been composed and been in circulation for centuries, including stories about gods and goddesses. Generally, they were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be read aloud to everybody, including women and Shudras, who did not have access to Vedic learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Much of what is contained in the Puranas evolved through interaction amongst people - priests, merchants, and ordinary men and women who travelled from place to place sharing ideas and beliefs. We know for instance that Vasudeva-Krishna was an important deity in the Mathura region. Over centuries, his worship spread to other parts of the country as well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">One of the unique features of early temples was that some of these were hollowed out of huge rocks, as artificial caves.

<p><span class="font30">By now you have had a glimpse of the rich visual traditions that existed in the past - expressed in brick and stone architecture, sculpture and painting. We have seen that much has been destroyed and lost over the centuries. Nevertheless, what remains and has been preserved conveys a sense of the vision of the artists, sculptors, masons and architects who created these spectacular works. Yet, do we always automatically understand what they wanted to convey? Can we ever know what these images meant to people who saw them and venerated them about 2,000 years ago?</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>11.1 Grappling with the unfamiliar</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">It will be useful to recall that when nineteenthcentury European scholars first saw some of the sculptures of gods and goddesses, they could not understand what these were about. Sometimes, they were horrified by what seemed to them grotesque</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">figures, with multiple arms and heads or with combinations of human and animal forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">These early scholars tried to make sense of what appeared to be strange images by comparing them with sculpture with which they were familiar, that from ancient Greece. While they often found early Indian sculpture inferior to the works of Greek artists, they were very excited when they discovered images of the Buddha and Bodhisattas that were evidently based on Greek models. These were, more often than not, found in the northwest, in cities such as Taxila and Peshawar, where Indo-Greek rulers had established kingdoms in the second century bce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">.</span><span class="font30"> As these images were closest to the Greek statues these scholars were familiar with, they were considered to be the best examples of early Indian art. In effect, these scholars adopted a strategy we all frequently use - devising yardsticks derived from the familiar to make sense of the unfamiliar.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Consider another problem. We have seen that art historians often draw upon textual traditions to understand the meaning of sculptures. While this is certainly a far more efficacious strategy than comparing Indian images with Greek statues, it is not always easy to use. One of the most intriguing examples of this is a famous sculpture along a huge rock surface in Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Clearly, Fig. 4.30 is a vivid depiction of a story. But which story is it? Art historians have searched through the Puranas to identify it and are sharply divided in their opinions. Some feel that this depicts the</span></p>
