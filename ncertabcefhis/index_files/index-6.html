<p><span class="font30">Vijayanagara or “city of victory” was the name of both a city and an empire. The empire was founded in the fourteenth century. In its heyday it stretched from the river Krishna in the north to the extreme south of the peninsula. In 1565 the city was sacked and subsequently deserted. Although it fell into ruin in the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries, it lived on in the memories of people living in the Krishna-Tungabhadra doab. They remembered it as Hampi, a name derived from that of the local mother goddess, Pampadevi. These oral traditions combined with archaeological finds, monuments and inscriptions and other records helped scholars to rediscover the Vijayanagara Empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The ruins at Hampi were brought to light in 1800 by an engineer and antiquarian named Colonel Colin Mackenzie. An employee of the English East India Company, he prepared the first survey map of the site. Much of the initial information he received was based on the memories of priests of the Virupaksha temple and the shrine of Pampadevi. Subsequently, from 1856, photographers began to record the monuments which enabled scholars to study them. As early as 1836 epigraphists began collecting several dozen inscriptions found at this and other temples at Hampi. In an effort to reconstruct the history of the city and the empire, historians collated information from these sources with accounts of foreign travellers and other literature written in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Born in 1754, Colin Mackenzie became famous as an engineer, surveyor and cartographer. In 1815 he was appointed the first Surveyor General of India, a post he held till his death in 1821. He embarked on collecting local histories and surveying historic sites in order to better understand India’s past and make governance of the colony easier. He says that “it struggled long under the miseries of bad management ... before the South came under the benign influence of the British government”. By studying Vijayanagara, Mackenzie believed that the East India Company could gain “much useful information on many of these institutions, laws and customs whose influence still prevails among the various Tribes of Natives forming the general mass of the population to this day”.</span></p>

This empire included within its fluctuating frontiers peoples who spoke different languages and followed different religious traditions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">On their northern frontier, the Vijayanagara kings competed with contemporary rulers - including the Sultans of the Deccan and the Gajapati rulers of Orissa - for control of the fertile river valleys and the resources generated by lucrative overseas trade. At the same time, interaction between these states led to sharing of ideas, especially in the field of architecture. The rulers of Vijayanagara borrowed concepts and building techniques which they then developed further.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Gajapati</span><span class="font50"> literally means lord of elephants. This was the name of a ruling lineage that was very powerful in Orissa in the fifteenth century In the popular traditions of Vijayanagara the Deccan Sultans are termed as </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">ashvapati</span><span class="font50"> or lord of horses and the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">rayas</span><span class="font50"> are called </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">narapati</span><span class="font50"> or lord of men.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Some of the areas that were incorporated within the empire had witnessed the development of powerful states such as those of the Cholas in Tamil Nadu and the Hoysalas in Karnataka. Ruling elites in these areas had extended patronage to elaborate temples such as the Brihadishvara temple at Thanjavur and the Chennakeshava temple at Belur. The rulers of Vijayanagara, who called themselves </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">rayas,</span><span class="font30"> built on these traditions and carried them, as we will see, literally to new heights.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">As warfare during these times depended upon effective cavalry, the import of horses from Arabia and Central Asia was very important for rival kingdoms. This trade was initially controlled by Arab traders. Local communities of merchants known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kudirai chettis</span><span class="font30"> or horse merchants also participated in these exchanges. From 1498 other actors appeared on the scene. These were the Portuguese, who arrived on the west coast of the subcontinent and attempted to establish trading and military stations. Their superior military technology, especially the use of muskets, enabled them to become important players in the tangled politics of the period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In fact, Vijayanagara was also noted for its markets dealing in spices, textiles and precious stones. Trade was often regarded as a status symbol for such cities, which boasted of a wealthy population that demanded high-value exotic goods, especially precious stones and jewellery. The revenue derived from trade in turn contributed significantly to the prosperity of the state.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>2.2 The apogee and decline of the empire</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Within the polity, claimants to power included members of the ruling lineage as well as military commanders. The first dynasty, known as the Sangama dynasty, exercised control till 1485. They were supplanted by the Saluvas, military commanders, who remained in power till 1503 when they were replaced by the Tuluvas. Krishnadeva Raya belonged to the Tuluva dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Krishnadeva Raya’s rule was characterised by expansion and consolidation. This was the time when the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers (the Raichur doab) was acquired (1512), the rulers of Orissa were subdued (1514) and severe defeats were inflicted on the Sultan of Bijapur (1520). Although the kingdom remained in a constant state of military preparedness, it flourished under conditions of unparalleled peace and prosperity. Krishnadeva Raya is credited with building some fine temples and adding impressive </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gopurams</span><span class="font30"> to many important south Indian temples. He also founded a suburban township near Vijayanagara called Nagalapuram after his mother. Some of the most detailed descriptions of Vijayanagara come from his time or just after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Strain began to show within the imperial structure following Krishnadeva Raya’s death in 1529. His successors were troubled by rebellious </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas</span><span class="font30"> or military chiefs. By 1542 control at the centre had shifted to another ruling lineage, that of the Aravidu, which remained in power till the end of the seventeenth century. During this period, as indeed earlier, the military ambitions of the rulers of Vijayanagara as well as those of the Deccan Sultanates resulted in shifting alignments. Eventually this led to an alliance of the Sultanates against Vijayanagara. In 1565 Rama Raya, the chief minister of Vijayanagara, led the army into battle at Rakshasi-Tangadi (also known as Talikota), where his forces were routed by the combined armies of Bijapur, Ahmadnagar and Golconda. The victorious armies sacked the city of Vijayanagara. The city was totally abandoned within a few years. Now the focus of the empire shifted to the east where the Aravidu</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Krishnadeva Raya (ruled 1509-29), the most famous ruler of Vijayanagara, composed a work on statecraft in Telugu known as the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Amuktamalyada.</span><span class="font50"> About traders he wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">A king should improve the harbours of his country and so encourage its commerce that horses, elephants, precious gems, sandalwood, pearls and other articles are freely imported ... He should arrange that the foreign sailors who land in his country on account of storms, illness and exhaustion are looked after in a suitable manner ... Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants and good horses be attached to yourself by providing them with daily audience, presents and allowing decent profits.

Krishnadeva Raya, for example, supported some claimants to power in the Sultanates and took pride in the title “establisher of the Yavana kingdom”. Similarly, the Sultan of Bijapur intervened to resolve succession disputes in Vijayanagara following the death of Krishnadeva Raya. In fact the Vijayanagara kings were keen to ensure the stability of the Sultanates and vice versa. It was the adventurous policy of Rama Raya who tried to play off one Sultan against another that led the Sultans to combine together and decisively defeat him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Among those who exercised power in the empire were military chiefs who usually controlled forts and had armed supporters. These chiefs often moved from one area to another, and in many cases were accompanied by peasants looking for fertile land on which to settle. These chiefs were known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas </span><span class="font30">and they usually spoke Telugu or Kannada. Many </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas</span><span class="font30"> submitted to the authority of the kings of Vijayanagara but they often rebelled and had to be subdued by military action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">amara-nayaka</span><span class="font30"> system was a major political innovation of the Vijayanagara Empire. It is likely that many features of this system were derived from the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">iqta</span><span class="font30"> system of the Delhi Sultanate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">amara-nayakas</span><span class="font30"> were military commanders who were given territories to govern by the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">raya. </span><span class="font30">They collected taxes and other dues from peasants, craftspersons and traders in the area. They retained part of the revenue for personal use and for maintaining a stipulated contingent of horses and elephants. These contingents provided the Vijayanagara kings with an effective fighting force with which they brought the entire southern peninsula under their control. Some of the revenue was also used for the maintenance of temples and irrigation works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">amara-nayakas</span><span class="font30"> sent tribute to the king annually and personally appeared in the royal court with gifts to express their loyalty. Kings occasionally asserted their control over them by transferring them from one place to another. However, during the course of the seventeenth century, many of these </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas </span><span class="font30">established independent kingdoms. This hastened the collapse of the central imperial structure.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Amara</span><span class="font30"> is believed to be derived from the Sanskrit word </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">samara, </span><span class="font30">meaning battle or war.

<p><span class="font50">This is an excerpt from Domingo Paes’s description of Vijayanagara:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The size of this city I do not write here, because it cannot all be seen from any one spot, but I climbed a hill whence I could see a great part of it; I could not see it all because it lies between several ranges of hills. What I saw from thence seemed to me as large as Rome, and very beautiful to the sight; there are many groves of trees within it, in the gardens of the houses, and many conduits of water which flow into the midst of it, and in places there are lakes; and the king has close to his palace a palm-grove and other rich fruit-bearing trees.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The most striking feature about the location of Vijayanagara is the natural basin formed by the river Tungabhadra which flows in a north-easterly direction. The surrounding landscape is characterised by stunning granite hills that seem to form a girdle around the city. A number of streams flow down to the river from these rocky outcrops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In almost all cases embankments were built along these streams to create reservoirs of varying sizes. As this is one of the most arid zones of the peninsula, elaborate arrangements had to be made to store rainwater and conduct it to the city. The most important such tank was built in the early years of the fifteenth century and is now called Kamalapuram tank. Water from this tank not only irrigated fields nearby but was also conducted through a channel to the “royal centre”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">One of the most prominent waterworks to be seen among the ruins is the Hiriya canal. This canal drew water from a dam across the Tungabhadra and irrigated the cultivated valley that separated the “sacred centre” from the “urban core”. This was apparently built by kings of the Sangama dynasty.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>3.2 Fortifications and roads</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Before we examine the different parts of the city in detail let us look at what enclosed them all - the great fortress walls. Abdur Razzaq, an ambassador sent by the ruler of Persia to Calicut (present-day Kozhikode) in the fifteenth century, was greatly impressed by the fortifications, and mentioned seven lines of forts. These encircled not only the city but also its agricultural hinterland and forests. The outermost wall linked the hills surrounding the city. The massive masonry construction was slightly tapered. No mortar or cementing agent was employed anywhere in the construction. The stone blocks were wedge shaped, which held them in place, and the inner portion of the walls was of earth packed with rubble. Square or rectangular bastions projected outwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">What was most significant about this fortification is that it enclosed agricultural tracts. Abdur Razzaq noted that “between the first, second and the third walls there are cultivated fields, gardens and houses”. And Paes observed: “From this first circuit until you</span></p>

This water is brought from a lake which itself overflows into a little river. The tank has three large pillars handsomely carved with figures; these connect above with certain pipes by which they get water when they have to irrigate their gardens and rice-fields. In order to make this tank the said king broke down a hill ... In the tank I saw so many people at work that there must have been fifteen or twenty thousand men, looking like ants ...</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">enter the city there is a great distance, in which are fields in which they sow rice and have many gardens and much water, in which water comes from two lakes.” These statements have been corroborated by present-day archaeologists, who have also found evidence of an agricultural tract between the sacred centre and the urban core. This tract was serviced by an elaborate canal system drawing water from the Tungabhadra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Why do you think agricultural tracts were incorporated within the fortified area? Often, the objective of medieval sieges was to starve the defenders into submission. These sieges could last for several months and sometimes even years. Normally rulers tried to be prepared for such situations by building large granaries within fortified areas. The rulers of Vijayanagara adopted a more expensive and elaborate strategy of protecting the agricultural belt itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A second line of fortification went round the inner core of the urban complex, and a third line surrounded the royal centre, within which each set of major buildings was surrounded by its own high walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The fort was entered through well-guarded gates, which linked the city to the major roads. Gateways were distinctive architectural features that often defined the structures to which they regulated access. The arch on the gateway leading into the fortified settlement as well as the dome over the gate (Fig. 7.6) are regarded as typical features of the architecture introduced by the Turkish Sultans. Art historians refer to this style as Indo-Islamic, as it grew continually through interaction with local building practices in different regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Archaeologists have studied roads within the city and those leading out from it. These have been identified by tracing paths through gateways, as well as by finds of pavements. Roads generally wound around through the valleys, avoiding rocky terrain. Some of the most important roads extended from temple gateways, and were lined by bazaars.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>3.3 The urban core</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Moving along the roads leading into the urban core, there is relatively little archaeological evidence of the houses of ordinary people. Archaeologists have found fine Chinese porcelain in some areas, including in the north-eastern corner of the urban core and suggest that these areas may have been occupied by rich traders. This was also the Muslim residential quarter. Tombs and mosques located here have distinctive functions, yet their architecture resembles that of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mandapas</span><span class="font30"> found in the temples of Hampi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This is how the sixteenth-century Portuguese traveller Barbosa described the houses of ordinary people, which have not survived: ‘The other houses of the people are thatched, but nonetheless well built and arranged according to occupations, in long streets with many open places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Field surveys indicate that the entire area was dotted with numerous shrines and small temples, pointing to the prevalence of a variety of cults, perhaps supported by different communities. The surveys also indicate that wells, rainwater tanks as well as temple tanks may have served as sources of water to the ordinary town dwellers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Some of the more distinctive structures in the area have been assigned names based on the form of the buildings as well as their functions. The “king’s palace” is the largest of the enclosures but has not yielded definitive evidence of being a royal residence. It has two of the most impressive platforms, usually called the “audience hall” and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">“mahanavami dibba”.</span><span class="font30"> The entire complex is surrounded by high double walls with a street running between them. The audience hall is a high platform with slots for wooden pillars at close and regular intervals. It had a staircase going up to the second floor, which rested on these pillars. The pillars being closely spaced, would have left little free space and thus it is not clear what the hall was used for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Located on one of the highest points in the city, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">“mahanavami dibba”</span><span class="font30"> is a massive platform rising from a base of about 11,000 sq. ft to a height of 40 ft. There is evidence that it supported a wooden structure. The base of the platform is covered with relief carvings (Fig. 7.12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Rituals associated with the structure probably coincided with Mahanavami (literally, the great ninth day) of the ten-day Hindu festival during the autumn months of September and October, known variously as Dusehra (northern India), Durga Puja (in Bengal)</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">and Navaratri or Mahanavami (in peninsular India). The Vijayanagara kings displayed their prestige, power and suzerainty on this occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The ceremonies performed on the occasion included worship of the image, worship of the state horse, and the sacrifice of buffaloes and other animals. Dances, wrestling matches, and processions of caparisoned horses, elephants and chariots and soldiers, as well as ritual presentations before the king and his guests by the chief </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas</span><span class="font30"> and subordinate kings marked the occasion. These ceremonies were imbued with deep symbolic meanings. On the last day of the festival the king inspected his army and the armies of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas</span><span class="font30"> in a grand ceremony in an open field. On this occasion the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas</span><span class="font30"> brought rich gifts for the king as well as the stipulated tribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Was the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">“mahanavami dibba”</span><span class="font30"> that stands today the centre of this elaborate ritual? Scholars have pointed out that the space surrounding the structure does not seem to have been adequate for elaborate processions of armed men, women, and large numbers of animals. Like some of the other structures in the royal centre, it remains an enigma.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">We now move to the rocky northern end of the city on the banks of the Tungabhadra. According to local tradition, these hills sheltered the monkey kingdom of Vali and Sugriva mentioned in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ramayana. </span><span class="font30">Other traditions suggest that Pampadevi, the local mother goddess, did penance in these hills in order to marry Virupaksha, the guardian deity of the kingdom, also recognised as a form of Shiva. To this day this marriage is celebrated annually in the Virupaksha temple. Among these hills are found Jaina temples of the pre-Vijayanagara period as well. In other words, this area was associated with several sacred traditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Temple building in the region had a long history, going back to dynasties such as the Pallavas, Chalukyas, Hoysalas and Cholas. Rulers very often encouraged temple building as a means of associating themselves with the divine - often, the deity was explicitly or implicitly identified with the king. Temples also functioned as centres of learning. Besides, rulers and others often granted land and other resources for the maintenance of temples. Consequently, temples developed as significant religious, social, cultural and economic centres. From the point of view of the rulers, constructing, repairing and maintaining temples were important means of winning support and recognition for their power, wealth and piety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">It is likely that the very choice of the site of Vijayanagara was inspired by the existence of the shrines of Virupaksha and Pampadevi. In fact the Vijayanagara kings claimed to rule on behalf of the god Virupaksha. All royal orders were signed “Shri Virupaksha”, usually in the Kannada script. Rulers also indicated their close links with the gods by using the title “Hindu Suratrana”. This was a Sanskritisation of the Arabic term Sultan, meaning king, so it literally meant Hindu Sultan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Even as they drew on earlier traditions, the rulers of Vijayanagara innovated and developed these. Royal portrait sculpture was now displayed in temples, and the king’s visits to temples were treated as important state occasions on which he was accompanied by the important </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nay okas</span><span class="font30"> of the empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The Virupaksha temple was built over centuries. While inscriptions suggest that the earliest shrine dated to the ninth-tenth centuries, it was substantially enlarged with the establishment of the Vijayanagara Empire. The hall in front of the main shrine was built by Krishnadeva Raya to mark his accession. This was decorated with delicately carved pillars. He is also credited with the construction of the eastern </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gopuram.</span><span class="font30"> These additions meant that the central shrine came to occupy a relatively small part of the complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The halls in the temple were used for a variety of purposes. Some were spaces in which the images of gods were placed to witness special programmes of music, dance, drama, etc. Others were used to celebrate the marriages of deities, and yet others were meant for the deities to swing in. Special images, distinct from those kept in the small central shrine, were used on these occasions.</span></p>

The introduction of the worship of the deity in Karnataka is another indication of the ways in which the rulers of Vijayanagara drew on different traditions to create an imperial culture. As in the case of other temples, this temple too has several halls and a unique shrine designed as a chariot (Fig. 7.24).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A characteristic feature of the temple complexes is the chariot streets that extended from the temple </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gopuram</span><span class="font30"> in a straight line. These streets were paved with stone slabs and lined with pillared pavilions in which merchants set up their shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Just as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas</span><span class="font30"> continued with and elaborated on traditions of fortification, so they did with traditions of temple building. In fact, some of the most spectacular </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gopurams</span><span class="font30"> were also built by the local </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nayakas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">O Discuss...</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">How and why did the rulers of Vijayanagara adopt and adapt earlier traditions of ritual architecture?</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">We have been examining a wealth of information on Vijayanagara - photographs, plans, elevations of structures and sculpture. How was all of this produced? After the initial surveys by Mackenzie, information was pieced together from travellers’ accounts and inscriptions. Through the twentieth century, the site was preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India and the Karnataka Department of Archaeology and Museums. In 1976, Hampi was recognised as a site of national importance. Then, in the early 1980s, an important project was launched to document the material remains at Vijayanagara in detail, through extensive and intensive surveys, using a variety of recording techniques. Over nearly twenty years, dozens of scholars from all over the world worked to compile and preserve this information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Let us look at just one part of this enormous exercise - mapping - in more detail. The first step was to divide the entire area into a set of 25 squares, each designated by a letter of the alphabet. Then, each of the small squares was subdivided into a set of even smaller squares. But this was not all: each of these smaller squares was further subdivided into yet smaller units.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As you can see, these detailed surveys have been extremely painstaking, and have recovered and documented traces of thousands of structures -from tiny shrines and residences to elaborate temples. They have also led to the recovery of traces of roads, paths, bazaars, etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The latter have been located through finds of pillar bases and platforms - all that remain of thriving markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">It is worth remembering something that John M. Fritz, George Michell and M.S. Nagaraja Rao, who worked for years at the site, wrote: “In our study of these monuments of Vijayanagara we have to imagine a whole series of vanished wooden elements -columns, brackets, beams, ceilings, overhanging eaves, and towers - decorated with plaster and painted, perhaps brightly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Although wooden structures are lost, and only stone structures survive, the descriptions left by travellers allow us to reconstruct some aspects of the vibrant life of the times.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>The bazaar</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Paes gives a vivid description of the bazaar:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Going forward, you have a broad and beautiful street ... In this street live many merchants, and there you will find all sorts of rubies, and diamonds, and emeralds, and pearls, and seed-pearls, and cloths, and every other sort of thing there is on earth and that you may wish to buy. Then you have there every evening a fair where they sell many common horses and nags, and also many citrons, and limes, and oranges, and grapes, and every other kind of garden stuff, and wood; you have all in this street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">More generally, he described the city as being “the best-provided city in the world” with the markets “stocked with provisions such as rice, wheat, grains, India corn and a certain amount of barley and beans, moong, pulses and horse-gram” all of which were cheaply and abundantly available. According to Fernao Nuniz, the Vijayanagara markets were “overflowing with abundance of fruits, grapes and oranges, limes, pomegranates, jackfruit and mangoes and all very cheap”. Meat too was sold in abundance in the marketplaces. Nuniz describes “mutton, pork, venison, partridges, hares, doves, quail and all kinds of birds, sparrows, rats and cats and lizards” as being sold in the market of Bisnaga (Vijayanagara).</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Buildings that survive tell us about the way spaces were organised and used, how they were built, with what materials and techniques. For example, we can assess the defence requirements and military preparedness of a city by studying its fortifications. Buildings also tell us about the spread of ideas and cultural influences if we compare them with buildings in other places. They convey ideas which the builders or their patrons wished to project. They are often suffused with symbols which are a product of their cultural context. These we can understand when we combine information from other sources like literature, inscriptions and popular traditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Krishnadeva Raya</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">To recapitulate about some of the problems of perspective, look at this beautiful statue of Krishnadeva Raya placed on the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">gopuram</span><span class="font50"> of the temple at Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu. This is obviously the way in which the ruler wanted to project himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">And this is how Paes describes the king:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Of medium height, and of fair complexion and good figure, rather fat than thin; he has on his face signs of smallpox.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Investigations of architectural features do not tell us what ordinary men, women and children, comprising the vast majority of the people who lived in the city and its outskirts, thought about these impressive buildings. Would they have had access to any of the areas within the royal centre or the sacred centre? Would they hurry past the sculpture, or would they pause to see, reflect and try and understand its complicated symbolism? And what did the people who worked on these colossal construction projects think of the enterprises to which they had contributed their labour?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While rulers took all important decisions about the buildings to be constructed, the site, the material to be used and the style to be followed, who possessed the specialised knowledge required for such enormous enterprises? Who drew up the plans for the buildings? Where did the masons, stonecutters, sculptors who did the actual building come from? Were they captured during war from neighbouring regions? What kind of wages did they get? Who supervised the building activity? How was building material transported and where did it come from? These are some of the questions that we cannot answer by merely looking at the buildings or their remains. Continuing research using other sources might provide some further clues.</span></p>
