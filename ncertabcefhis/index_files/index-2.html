<p><span class="font30">In the previous chapter we saw that there were several changes in economic and political life between c. 600 bce and 600 ce. Some of these changes influenced societies as well. For instance, the extension of agriculture into forested areas transformed the lives of forest dwellers;</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">craft specialists often emerged as distinct social groups;</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">the unequal distribution of wealth sharpened social differences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Historians often use textual traditions to understand these processes. Some texts lay down norms of social behaviour; others describe and occasionally comment on a wide range of social situations and practices. We can also catch a glimpse of some social actors from inscriptions. As we will see, each text (and inscription) was written from the perspective of specific social categories. So we need to keep in mind </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font30"> composed </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">what </span><span class="font30">and for </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">whom.</span><span class="font30"> We also need to consider the language used, and the ways in which the text</span></p>

It was composed over a period of about 1,000 years (c. 500 bce onwards), and some of the stories it contains may have been in circulation even earlier. The central story is about two sets of warring cousins. The text also contains sections laying down norms of behaviour for various social groups. Occasionally (though not always), the principal characters seem to follow these norms. What does conformity with norms and deviations from them signify?</span></p>

<p><span class="font54" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">One of the most ambitious projects of scholarship began in 1919, under the leadership of a noted Indian Sanskritist, V.S. Sukthankar. A team comprising dozens of scholars initiated the task of preparing a critical edition of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">aiaexa&gt;ltarat:a.</span><span class="font30"> What exactly did this involve? Initially, it meant collecting Sanskrit manuscripts of the text, written in a variety of scripts, from different parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The team worked out a method of comparing verses from each manuscript. Ultimately, they selected the verses that appeared common to most versions and published these in several volumes, running into over 13,000 pages. The project took 47 years to complete. Two things became apparent: there were several common elements in the Sanskrit versions of the story, evident in manuscripts found all over the subcontinent, from Kashmir and Nepal in the north to Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the south. Also evident were enormous regional variations in the ways in which the text had been transmitted over the centuries. These variations were documented in footnotes and appendices to the main text. Taken together, more than half the 13,000 pages are devoted to these variations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In a sense, these variations are reflective of the complex processes that shaped early (and later) social histories - through dialogues between dominant traditions and resilient local ideas and practices. These dialogues are characterised by moments of conflict as well as consensus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Our understanding of these processes is derived primarily from texts written in Sanskrit by and for Brahmanas. When issues of social history were explored for the first time by historians in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, they tended to take these texts at face value - believing that everything that was laid down in these texts was actually practised. Subsequently, scholars began studying other traditions, from works in Pali, Prakrit and Tamil. These studies indicated that the ideas</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">contained in normative Sanskrit texts were on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">whole recognised as authoritative: they were also questioned and occasionally even rejected. It is important to keep this in mind as we examine how historians reconstruct social histories.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">We often take family life for granted. However, you may have noticed that not all families are identical: they vary in terms of numbers of members, their relationship with one another as well as the kinds of activities they share. Often people belonging to the same family share food and other resources, and live, work and perform rituals together. Families are usually parts of larger networks of people defined as relatives, or to use a more technical term, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kinfolk</span><span class="font30">. While familial ties are often regarded as “natural” and based on blood, they are defined in many different ways. For instance, some regard cousins as being blood relations, others do not.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">For early societies, historians can information about elite families fairly easily; it is, however, far more difficult to reconstruct the familial relationships of ordinary people. Historians also investigate and analyse </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">attitudes</span><span class="font30"> towards family and kinship. These are important, because they provide an insight into people’s thinking; it is likely that some of these ideas would have shaped their actions, just as actions may have led to changes in attitudes.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>2.2 The ideal of patriliny</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Can we identify points when kinship relations changed? At one level, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> is a story about this. It describes a feud over land and power between two groups of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, who belonged to a single ruling family, that of the Kurus, a lineage dominating one of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">janapadas</span><span class="font30"> (Chapter 2, Map 1). Ultimately, the conflict ended in a battle, in which the Pandavas emerged victorious. After that, patrilineal succession was proclaimed. While patriliny had existed prior to the composition of the epic, the central story of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> reinforced the idea that it was valuable. Under patriliny, sons could claim the resources (including the throne in the case of kings) of their fathers when the latter died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Most ruling dynasties (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> sixth century BCE onwards) claimed to follow this system, although there were variations in practice: sometimes there were no sons,</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">The Kauravas were the ... sons of Dhritarashtra, and the Pandavas... were their cousins. Since Dhritarashtra was blind, his younger brother Pandu ascended the throne of Hastinapura (see Map 1) ... However, after the premature death of Pandu, Dhritarashtra became king, as the royal princes were still very young. As the princes grew up together, the citizens of Hastinapura began to express their preference for the Pandavas, for they were more capable and virtuous than the Kauravas. This made Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, jealous. He approached his father and said, “You yourself did not receive the throne, although it fell to you, because of your defect. If the Pandava ♦ receives the patrimony from Pandu, his son will surely^ inherit it in turn, and so will his son, and his. We ourselves with our sons shall be excluded from the royal succession and become of slight regard in the eyes of the world, lord of the earth!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">While sons were important for the continuity of the patrilineage, daughters were viewed rather differently within this framework. They had no claims to the resources of the household. At the same time, marrying them into families outside the kin was considered desirable. This system, called exogamy (literally, marrying outside), meant that the lives of young girls and women belonging to families that claimed high status were often carefully regulated to ensure that they were married at the “right” time and to the “right” person. This gave rise to the belief that </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kanyadana</span><span class="font30"> or the gift of a daughter in marriage was an important religious duty of the father.</span></p>

Faced with this challenge, the Brahmanas responded by laying down codes of social behaviour in great detail. These were meant to be followed by Brahmanas in particular and the rest of society in general. From c. 500 bce, these norms were compiled in Sanskrit texts known as the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras. The most important of such works, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mamutmriti</span><span class="font30">, was compiled between c. 200 bce and 200 ce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While the Brahmana authors of these texts claimed that their point of view had universal validity and that what they prescribed had to be obeyed by everybody, it is likely that real social relations were more complicated. Besides, given the regional diversity within the subcontinent and the difficulties of communication, the influence of Brahmanas was by no means all-pervasive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">What is interesting is that the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras recognised as many as eight forms of marriage. Of these, the first four were considered as “good” while the remaining were condemned. It is possible that these were practised by those who did not accept Brahmanical norms.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">One Brahmanical practice, evident from </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> 1000 bce onwards, was to classify people (especially Brahmanas) in terms of c/otrus. Each </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gatra</span><span class="font30"> was named after a Vedic seer, and all those who belonged to the same </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gotra</span><span class="font30"> were regarded as his descendants. Two rules about gotra were particularly important: women were expected to give up their father’s </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gotra </span><span class="font30">and adopt that of their husband on marriage and members of the same gotra could not marry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">One way to find out whether this was commonly followed is to consider the names of men and women, which were sometimes derived from </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gotra</span><span class="font30"> names. These names are available for powerful ruling lineages such as the Satavahanas who ruled over parts of western India and the Deccan (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> second century bc -second century ce ). Several of their inscriptions have been recovered, which allow historians to trace family ties, including marriages.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Some of the Satavahana rulers were polygynous (that is, had more than one wife). An examination of the names of women who married Satavahana rulers indicates that many of them had names derived from </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gotras</span><span class="font30"> such as Gotama and Vasistha, their father’s gotras. They evidently retained these names instead of adopting names derived from their husband’s </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gotra </span><span class="font30">name as they were required to do according to the Brahmanical rules. What is also apparent is that some of these women belonged to the same </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gotra.</span><span class="font30"> As is obvious, this ran counter to the ideal of exogamy recommended in the Brahmanical texts. In fact, it exemplified an alternative practice, that of endogamy or marriage within the kin group, which was (and is) prevalent amongst several communities in south India. Such marriages amongst kinfolk (such as cousins) ensured a close-knit community.</span></p>

<p><span class="font40" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Within and Beyond the Framework</span></p>
<p><span class="font40" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>of Caste</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">You are probably familiar with the term caste, which refers to a set of hierarchically ordered social categories. The ideal order was laid down in the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras. Brahmanas claimed that this order, in which they were ranked first, was divinely ordained, while placing groups classified as Shudras and “untouchables” at the very bottom of the social order. Positions within the order were supposedly determined by birth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>3.1 The “right” occupation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras also contained rules about the ideal “occupations” of the four categories or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">vamas.</span><span class="font30"> Brahmanas were supposed to study and teach the Vedas, perform sacrifices and get sacrifices performed, and give and receive gifts. Kshatriyas were to engage in warfare, protect people and administer justice, study the Vedas, get sacrifices performed, and make gifts. The last three “occupations” were also assigned to the Vaishyas, who were in addition expected to engage in agriculture, pastoralism and trade. Shudras were assigned only one occupation - that of serving the three “higher” </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">vamas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Brahmanas evolved two or three strategies for enforcing these norms. One, as we have just seen, was to assert that the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">varna</span><span class="font30"> order was of divine origin. Second, they advised kings to ensure that these norms were followed within their kingdoms. And third, they attempted to persuade people that their status was determined by birth. However, this was not always easy. So prescriptions were often reinforced by stories told in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> and other texts.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font50">To justify their claims, Brahmanas often cited a verse from a hymn in the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Rigveda </span><span class="font50">known as the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Purusha sukta, </span><span class="font50">describing the sacrifice of </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">purusha,</span><span class="font50"> the primeval man. All the elements of the universe, including the four social categories, were supposed to have emanated from his body:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The Brahmana was his mouth, of his arms was made the Kshatriya</span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">His thighs became the Vaishya</span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font50"> of his feet the Shudra was born</span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Here is a story from the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Adi Parvan</span><span class="font50"> of the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Once Drona, a Brahmana who taught archery to the Kuru princes, was approached by Ekalavya, a forestdwelling </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">nishaDa</span><span class="font50"> (a hunting community). When Drona, who knew the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">dharma,</span><span class="font50"> refused to have him as his pupil, Ekalavya returned to the forest, prepared an image of Drona out of clay, and treating it as his teacher, began to practise on his own. In due course, he acquired great skill in archery. One day, the Kuru princes went hunting and their dog, wandering in the woods, came upon Ekalavya. When the dog smelt the dark </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">nishada </span><span class="font50">wrapped in black deer skin, his body caked with dirt, it began to bark. Annoyed, Ekalavya shot seven arrows into its mouth. When the dog returned to the Pandavas, they were amazed at this superb display of archery. They tracked down Ekalavya, who introduced himself as a pupil of Drona.</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font29">What message do you think this story was meant to convey to the </span><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">nishadas?</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">What message would it convey to Kshatriyas </span><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">?</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">Do you think that Drona, as a Brahmana, was acting according to the Dharmasutras when he was teaching archery?</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Drona b6d once told his favourite student Arjuna, that he would be unrivalled amongst his pupils. Arjuna Iio'S reminded Drona about this. Drona approached Ekalawa, who immediately acknowledged and honoured him as his teacher. When Drona demanded his right thumb as his fee, Ekalavya unhesitatingly cut it off and offered it. But thereafter, when he shot with his remaining fingers, he was no longer as fast as he had been before. Thus, Drona kept his word: no one was better than Arjuna.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2 Non-Kshatriya kings</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">According to the Shastras, only Kshatriyas could be kings. However, several important ruling lineages probably had different origins. The social background of the Mauryas, who ruled over a large empire, has been hotly debated. While later Buddhist texts suggested they were Kshatriyas</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font30"> Brahmanical texts described them as being of “low” origin. The Shungas and Kanvas, the immediate successors of the Mauryas, were Brahmanas. In fact, political power was effectively open to anyone who could muster support and resources, and rarely depended on birth as a Kshatriya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Other rulers, such as the Shakas who came from Central Asia, were regarded as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mlechchhas</span><span class="font30">,</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">barbarians or outsiders by the Brahmanas. However, one of the earliest inscriptions in Sanskrit describes how Rudradaman, the best-known Shaka ruler (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> second century ce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">),</span><span class="font30"> rebuilt Sudarshana lake (Chapter 2). This suggests that powerful </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mlechchhas </span><span class="font30">were familiar with Sanskritic traditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">It is also interesting that the best-known ruler of the Satavahana dynasty, Gotami-puta Siri-Satakani, claimed to be both a unique Brahmana </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(eka bamhana)</span><span class="font30"> and a destroyer of the pride of Kshatriyas. He also claimed to have ensured that there was no intermarriage amongst members of the four </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">varnas. </span><span class="font30">At the same time, he entered into a marriage alliance with the kin of Rudradaman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As you can see from this example, integration within the framework of caste was often a complicated process. The Satavahanas claimed to be Brahmanas, whereas according to the Brahmanas</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font30"> kings ought to have been Kshatriyas. They claimed to uphold the fourfold </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">vama</span><span class="font30"> order, but entered into marriage alliances with people who were supposed to be excluded from the system. And, as we have seen, they practised endogamy instead of the exogamous system recommended in the Brahmanical texts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">These complexities are reflected in another term used in texts to refer to social categories - </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jati.</span><span class="font30"> In Brahmanical theory, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jati,</span><span class="font30"> like </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">varna,</span><span class="font30"> was based on birth. However, while the number of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">varnas</span><span class="font30"> was fixed at four, there was no restriction on the number of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jatis.</span><span class="font30"> In fact, whenever Brahmanical authorities encountered new groups - for instance, people living in forests such as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nishadas</span><span class="font30"> - or wanted to assign a name to occupational categories such as the goldsmith or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">suvarnakara,</span><span class="font30"> which did not easily fit into the fourfold </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">vama</span><span class="font30"> system, they classified them as a </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jati. Jatis</span><span class="font30"> which shared a common occupation or profession were sometimes organised into </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">shrenis </span><span class="font30">or guilds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">We seldom come across documents that record the histories of these groups. But there are exceptions. One interesting stone inscription (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font30">. fifth century ce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">),</span><span class="font30"> found in Mandasor (Madhya Pradesh), records the history of a guild of silk weavers who originally lived in Lata (Gujarat), from where they</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The inscription provides a fascinating glimpse of complex social processes and provides insights into the nature of guilds or shrenis. Although membership was based on a shared craft specialisation, some members adopted other occupations. It also indicates that the members shared more than a common profession - they collectively decided to invest their wealth, earned through their craft, to construct a splendid temple in honour of the sun god.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Given the diversity of the subcontinent, there were, and always have been, populations whose social practices were not influenced by Brahmanical ideas. When they figure in Sanskrit texts, they are often described as odd, uncivilised, or even animal-like. In some instances, these included forest-dwellers -for whom hunting and gathering remained an important means of subsistence. Categories such as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nishada,</span><span class="font30"> to which Ekalavya is supposed to have belonged, are examples of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Others who were viewed with suspicion included populations such as nomadic pastoralists, who could not be easily accommodated within the framework of settled agriculturists. Sometimes those who spoke non-Sanskritic languages were labelled as</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mlechchhas</span><span class="font30"> and looked down upon. There was nonetheless also a sharing of ideas and beliefs between these people.

A man-eating </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">rakshasa</span><span class="font50"> caught the scent of the Pandavas and sent his sister Hidimba to capture them. She fell in love with Bhima, transformed herself into a lovely maiden and proposed to him. He refused. Meanwhile, the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">rakshasa</span><span class="font50"> arrived and challenged Bhima to a wrestling match. Bhima accepted the challenge and killed him. The others woke up hearing the noise. Hidimba introduced herself, and declared her love for Bhima. She told Kunti: “I have forsaken my friends, my </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">dharma</span><span class="font50"> and my kin; and good lady, chosen your tiger-like son for my man ... whether you think me a fool, or your devoted servant, let me jojowou, great lady, with your son as my husband.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Ultimately, Yudhisthira agreed to the marriage on condition that they would spend the day together but that Bhima would return every night. The couple roamed all over the world during the day. In due course Hidimba gave birth to a </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">rakshasa</span><span class="font50"> boy named I Ghatotkacha. Then the mother and son left the Pandavas. Ghatotkacha promised to return to the Pandavas whenever they needed him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Some historians suggest that the term </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">rakshasa</span><span class="font50"> is used to describe people whose practices differed from those laid down in Brahmanical texts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;">Subordination and conflict</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">While the Brahmanas considered some people as being outside the system, they also developed a sharper social divide by classifying certain social categories as “untouchable”. This rested on a notion that certain activities, especially those connected with the performance of rituals, were sacred and by extension “pure”. Those who considered themselves pure avoided taking food from those they designated as “untouchable”. In sharp contrast to the purity aspect, some activities were regarded as particularly “polluting”. These included handling corpses and dead animals. Those who performed such tasks, designated as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">chandalaa,</span><span class="font30"> were placed at the very bottom of the hierarchy. Their touch and, in some cases, even seeing them was regarded as “polluting” by those who claimed to be at the top of the social order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Manusmriti</span><span class="font30"> laid down the “duties” of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ehandalas.</span><span class="font30"> They had to live outside the village, use discarded utensils, and wear clothes of the dead and ornaments of iron. They could not walk about in villages and cities at night. They had to dispose of the bodies of those who had no relatives and serve as executioners. Much later, the Chinese Buddhist monk Fa Xian (c. fifth century ce</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">)</span><span class="font30"> wrote that “untouchables” had to sound a clapper in the streets so that people could avoid seeing them. Another Chinese pilgrim, Xuan Zang (c. seventh century), observed that executioners and scavengers were forced to live outside the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By examining non-Brahmanical texts which depict the lives of dici/i(Mas. historians have tried to find out whether </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">chandalas </span><span class="font30">accepted the life of degradation prescribed in the Shastras. Sometimes, these depictions correspond with those in the Brahmanical texts. But occasionally, there are hints of different social realities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Once, the Bodhisatta was born outside the city of Banaras as a </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">chandala’s</span><span class="font50"> son and named Matanga. One day, when he had gone to the city on some work, he encountered Dittha Mangalika, the daughter of a merchant. When she saw him, she exclaimed “I have seen something inauspicious” and washed her eyes. The angry hangers-on then beat him up. In protest, he went and lay down at the door of her father’s house. On the seventh day they brought out the girl and gave her to him. She carried the starving Matanga back to the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">chandala</span><span class="font50"> settlement. Once he returned home, he decided to renounce the world. After attaining spiritual powers, he returned to Banaras and married her. A son named Mandavya Kumara was born to them. He learnt the three Vedas as he grew up and began to provide food to 16,000 Brahmanas every daypp</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">One day, Matanga, dressed in rags, with a clay alms bowl in his hand, arrived at his son’s doorstep and begged for food. Mandavya replied that he looked like an outcaste and was unworthy aS alms; the food was meant for the Brahmanas. Matanga said: “Those who are proud of their birth and are ignorant do not deserve gifts. On the contrary, those who are free from vices are worthy of offerings.” Mandavya lost his temper and asked his servants to throw the man out. Matanga rose in the air and disappeared. When Dittha Mangalika learnt about the incident, she followed Matanga and begged his forgiveness. He asked her to take a bit of the leftover from his bowl and give it to Mandavya and the Brahmanas ...</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">If you recall the economic relations discussed in Chapter 2, you will realise that slaves, landless agricultural labourers, hunters, fisherfolk, pastoralists, peasants, village headmen, craftspersons, merchants and kings emerged as social actors in different parts of the subcontinent. Their social positions were often shaped by their access to economic resources. Here we will examine the social implications of access to resources in certain specific situations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>4.1 Gendered access to property</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Consider first a critical episode in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata. </span><span class="font30">During the course of the long-drawn rivalry between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, Duryodhana invited Yudhisthira to a game of dice. The latter, who was deceived by his rival, staked his gold, elephants, chariots, slaves, army, treasury, kingdom, the property of his subjects, his brothers and finally himself and lost all. Then he staked their common wife Draupadi and lost her too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Issues of ownership, foregrounded in stories such as this one (Source 11), also figure in the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras. According to the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mabiidmriti,</span><span class="font30"> the paternal estate was to be divided equally amongst sons after the death of the parents, with a special share for the eldest. Women could not claim a share of these resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">However, women were allowed to retain the gifts they received on the occasion of their marriage as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">stridhana</span><span class="font30"> (literally, a woman’s wealth). This could be inherited by their children, without the husband having any claim on it. At the same time, the Manus mriti warned women against hoarding family property, or even their own valuables, without the husband’s permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">You have read about wealthy women such as the Vakataka queen Prabhavati Gupta (Chapter 2). However, cumulative evidence - both epigraphic and textual - suggests that while upper-class women may have had access to resources, land, cattle and money were generally controlled by men. In other words, social differences between men and women were sharpened because of the differences in access to resources.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>How could men and women acquire wealth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">For men, the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Manusmriti</span><span class="font50"> declares, there are seven means of acquiring wealth: inheritance, finding, purchase, conquest, investment, work, and acceptance of gifts from good people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">For women, there are six means of acquiring wealth: what was given in front of the fire (marriage) or the bridal procession, or as a token of affection, and what she got from her brother, mother or father. She could also acquire wealth through any subsequent gift and whatever her “affectionate” husband might give her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">According to the Brahmanical texts, another criterion (apart from gender) for regulating access,? to wealth was </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">varna.</span><span class="font30"> As we saw earlier, the only “occupation” prescribed for Shudras was servitude, while a variety of occupations were listed for men of the first three </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">varnas.</span><span class="font30"> If these provisions were actually implemented, the wealthiest men would have been the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas. That this corresponded to some extent with social realities is evident from descriptions of priests and kings in other textual traditions. Kings are almost invariably depicted as wealthy: priests are also generally shown to be rich, though there are occasional depictions of the poor Brahmana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">At another level, even as the Brahmanical view of society was codified in the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras, other traditions developed critiques of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">varna</span><span class="font30"> order. Some of the best-known of these were developed within early Buddhism (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> sixth century bce onwards; see also Chapter 4). The Buddhists recognised that there were differences in society, but did not regard these as natural or inflexible. They also rejected the idea of claims to status on the basis of birth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The wealthy Shudra</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This story, based on a Buddhist text in Pali known as the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Majjhima Nikaya,</span><span class="font50"> is part of a dialogue between a king named Avantiputta and a disciple of the Buddha named Kachchana. While it may not be literally true, it reveals Buddhist attitudes towards </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">varna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Avantiputta asked Kachchana what he thought about Brahmanas who held that they were the best caste and that all other castes were low; that Brahmanas were a fair caste while all other castes were dark; that only Brahmanas were pure, not non-Brahmanas; that Brahmanas were sons of Brahma, born of his mouth, born of Brahma, formed by Brahma, heirs to Brahma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Kachchana replied: “What if a Shudra were wealthy ... would another ShudrcjQ.or a Kshatriya or a Brahmana or a Vaishya-J^pcak politely to him?”</span></p>
<div style="border-right:solid;">

<p><span class="font29">What, according to this text, explains social difference?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font50">Avantiputta replied that if a Shudra had wealth or - -j corn or gold or silver, he could have as his obedient servant another Shudra to get up earlier than he, to go to rest later, to carry out his orders, to speak politely; or he could even have a Kshatriya or a Brahmana or a Vaishya as his obedient servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Kachchana asked: “This being so, are not these four I </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">varnas</span><span class="font50"> exactly the same?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Avantiputta conceded that there was no difference . amongst the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">varnas</span><span class="font50"> on this count.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;">4.3 An alternative social scenario: Sharing wealth</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">So far we have been examining situations where people either claimed or were assigned status on the basis of their wealth. However, there were other possibilities as well; situations where men who were generous were respected, while those who were miserly or simply accumulated wealth for themselves were despised. One area where these values were cherished was ancient Tamilakam, where, as we saw earlier (Chapter 2), there were several chiefdoms around 2,000 years ago. Amongst other things, the chiefs were patrons of bards and poets who sang their praise. Poems included in the Tamil Sangam anthologies often illuminate social and economic</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">relationships, suggesting that while there were differences between rich and poor, those who controlled resources were also expected to share them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font40" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>A Social Contract</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Buddhists also developed an alternative understanding of social inequalities, and of the institutions required to regulate social conflict. In a myth found in a text known as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Sutta Pitaka</span><span class="font30"> they suggested that originally human beings did not have fully evolved bodily forms, nor was the world of plants fully developed. All beings lived in an idyllic state of peace, taking from nature only what they needed for each meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">However, there was a gradual deterioration of this state as human beings became increasingly greedy, vindictive and deceitful. This led them to wonder: “What if we were to select a certain being who should be wrathful when indignation is right, who should censure that which should rightly be censured and should banish him who deserves to be banished? We will give him in return a proportion of the rice <sub>k</sub>Ochosen by the whole people, he will be known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahasammata,</span><span class="font30"> the great elect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This suggests that the institution of kingship was based on human choice, with taxes as a form of payment for services rendered by the king. At the same time, it reveals recognition of human agency in creating and institutionalising economic and social relations. There are other implications as well. For instance, if human beings were responsible for the creation of the system, they could also change it in future.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">If you look through the sources cited in this chapter once more you will notice that historians consider several elements when they analyse texts. They examine whether texts were written in Prakrit, Pali or Tamil, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">languages</span><span class="font30"> that were probably used by ordinary people, or in Sanskrit, a language meant almost exclusively for priests and elites. They also consider the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kinds</span><span class="font30"> of text. Were these mantras, learnt and chanted by ritual specialists, or stories that people could have read, or heard, and then retold if they found them interesting? Besides, they try to find out about the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">author(s)</span><span class="font30"> whose perspectives and ideas shaped the text, as well as the intended </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">audience</span><span class="font30">, as, very often, authors keep the interests of their audience in mind while composing their work. And they try and ascertain the possible </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">date </span><span class="font30">of the composition or compilation of the texts as well as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">place</span><span class="font30"> where they may have been composed. It is only after making these assessments that they draw on the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">content</span><span class="font30"> of texts to arrive at an understanding of their historical significance. As you can imagine, this is a particularly difficult task for a text as complex as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>6.1 Language and content</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Let us look at the language of the text. The version of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> we have been considering is in Sanskrit (although there are versions in other languages as well). However, the Sanskrit used in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> is far simpler than that of the Vedas, or of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">prashastis</span><span class="font30"> discussed in Chapter 2. As such, it was probably widely understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Historians usually classify the contents of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">present text under two broad heads - sections that contain stories, designated as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">narrative,</span><span class="font30"> and sections that contain prescriptions about social norms, designated as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">didactic.</span><span class="font30"> This division is by no means watertight - the didactic sections include</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">stories, and the narrative often contains a social message. However, generally historians agree that the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> was meant to be a dramatic, moving story, and that the didactic portions were probably added later.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Interestingly, the text is described as an </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">itihasa </span><span class="font30">within early Sanskrit tradition. The literal meaning of the term is “thus it was”, which is why it is generally translated as “history”. Was there a real war that was remembered in the epic? We are not sure. Some historians think that the memory of an actual conflict amongst kinfolk was preserved in the narrative; others point out that there is no other corroborative evidence of the battle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Who wrote the text? This is a question to which there are several answers. The original story was probably composed by charioteer-bards known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sritas</span><span class="font30"> who generally accompanied Kshatriya warriors to the battlefield and composed poems celebrating their victories and other achievements. These compositions circulated orally. Then, from the fifth century bce, Brahmana^^ook over the story and began to commit it to writing. This was the time when chiefdoms such as those of the Kurus and</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Panchalas, around whom the story of the epic revolves, were gradually becoming kingdoms. Did the new kings want their </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">itihasa</span><span class="font30"> to be recorded and preserved more systematically? It is also possible that the upheavals that often accompanied the establishment of these states, where old social values were often replaced by new norms, are reflected in some parts of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">We notice another phase in the composition of the text between c. 200 bce and 200 ce. This was the period when the worship of Vishnu was growing in importance, and Krishna, one of the important figures of the epic, was coming to be identified with Vishnu. Subsequently, between c. 200 and 400 ce, large didactic sections resembling the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Manusmriti </span><span class="font30">were added. With these additions, a text which initially perhaps had less than 10,000 verses grew to comprise about 100,000 verses. This enormous composition is traditionally attributed to a sage named Vyasa</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>6.3 The search for convergence</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata,</span><span class="font30"> like any major epic, contains vivid descriptions of battles, forests, palaces and settlements. In 1951-52, the archaeologist B.B. Lal excavated at a village named Hastinapura in Meerut (Uttar Pradesh). Was this the Hastinapura of the epic? While the similarity inQiames could be coincidental, the location of the site in the Upper Ganga doab, where the Kuru kingdom was situated, suggests that it may have been the capital of the Kurus mentioned in the text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Lal found evidence of five occupational levels, of which the second and third are of interest to us. This is what Lal noted about the houses in the second phase (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font30">. twelfth-seventh centuries bce): “Within the limited area excavated, no definite plans of houses were obtained, but walls of mud and mud-bricks were duly encountered. The discovery of mud-plaster with prominent reed-marks suggested that some of the houses had reed walls plastered over with mud.” For the third phase (</span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font30"> sixth-third centuries bce), he noted: “Houses of this period were built of mud-brick as well as burnt bricks. Soakage jars and brick drains were used for draining out refuse water, while terracotta ring-wells may have been used both as wells and drainage pits.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Consider another instance. One of the most challenging episodes in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> is Draupadi’s marriage with the Pandavas, an instance of polyandry that is central to the narrative. If we examine the section of the epic that describes this event, it is evident that the author(s) attempted to explain it in a variety of ways.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Drupada, the king of Panchala, organised a competition where the challenge was to string a bow and hit a target; the winner would be chosen to marry his daughter Draupadi. Arjuna was victorious and was garlanded by Draupadi. The Pandavas returned with her to their mother KuntS whey Qycm before she saw them, asked them to share whatever they had got. She realised her mistake when she saw Draupadi, but her command could not be violated. After much deliberation, Yudhisthira decided that Draupadi would be their common wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">When Drupada was told about this, he protested. However, the seer Vyasa arrived and told him that the Pandavas were in reality incarnations of Indra, whose wife had been reborn as Draupadi, and they were thus destined for each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Vyasa added that in another instance a young woman had prayed to Shiva for a husband, and in her enthusiasm, had prayed five times instead of once. This woman was now reborn as Draupadi, and Shiva had fulfilled her prayers. Convinced by these stories, Drupada consented to the marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Present-day historians suggest that the fact that the author(s) describe a polyandrous union indicates that polyandry may have been prevalent amongst ruling elites at some point of time. At the same time, the fact that so many different explanations are offered for the episode (Source 16) suggests that polyandry gradually fell into disfavour amongst the Brahmanas, who reworked and developed the text through the centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Some historians note that while the practice of polyandry may have seemed unusual or even undesirable from the Brahmanical point of view, it was (and is) prevalent in the Himalayan region. Others suggest that there may have been a shortage of women during times of warfare, and this led to polyandry. In other words, it was attributed to a situation of crisis.</span></p>
<div><img src="index-70.jpg" alt="" style="width:26pt;height:30pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Some early sources suggest that polyandry was not the only or even the most prevalent form of marriage. Why then did the author(s) choose to associate this practice with the central characters of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata?</span><span class="font30"> We need to remember that creative literature often has its own narrative requirements and does not always literally reflect social realities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The growth of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> did not stop with the Sanskrit version. Over the centuries, versions of the epic were written in a variety of languages through an ongoing process of dialogue between peoples, communities, and those who wrote the texts. Several stories that originated in specific regions or circulated amongst certain people found their way into the epic. At the same time, the central story of the epic was often retold in different ways. And episodes were depicted in sculpture and painting. They also provided themes for a wide range of performing arts - plays, dance and other kinds of narrations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">read or heard the epic?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Most retellings or re-enactments of the epic draw on the main narrative in creative ways. Let us look at one example, an episode from the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> that has been transformed by Mahashweta Devi, a contemporary Bengali writer known for raising her voice against all forms of exploitation and oppression. In this particular instance, she works out alternative possibilities from the main story of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> and draws attention to questions on which the Sanskrit text is silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Sanskrit text describes how Duryodhana plotted to kill the Pandavas by inviting them to stay in a specially prepared house of lac, which he planned to set on fire. Forewarned, the Pandavas dug a tunnel to ensure their escape. Then Kunti arranged for a feast.
