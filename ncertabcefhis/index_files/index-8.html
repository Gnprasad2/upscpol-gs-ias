<p><span class="font30">The rulers of the Mughal Empire saw themselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">as appointed by Divine Will to rule over a large</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">political circumstances, it remained important. One way of transmitting this vision was through the writing of dynastic histories. The Mughal kings commissioned court historians to write accounts. These accounts recorded the events of the emperor’s time. In addition, their writers collected vast amounts of information from the regions of the subcontinent to help the rulers govern their domain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Modern historians writing in English have termed this genre of texts </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">chronicles,</span><span class="font30"> as they present a continuous chronological record of events. Chronicles are an indispensable source for any scholar wishing to write a history of the Mughals. At one level they were a repository of factual information about the institutions of the Mughal state, painstakingly</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">collected and classified by individuals closely connected with the court. At the same time these texts were intended as conveyors of meanings that the Mughal rulers</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">sought to impose on their domain. They therefore</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">give us a glimpse into how imperial ideologies were created and disseminated. This chapter will look at the workings of this rich and fascinating dimension of the Mughal Empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The name Mughal derives from Mongol. Though today the term evokes the grandeur of an empire, it was not the name the rulers of the dynasty chose for themselves. They referred to themselves as Timurids, as descendants of the Turkish ruler Timur on the paternal side. Babur, the first Mughal ruler, was related to Ghenghiz Khan from his mother’s side. He spoke Turkish and referred derisively to the Mongols as barbaric hordes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">During the sixteenth century, Europeans used the term Mughal to describe the Indian rulers of this branch of the family. Over the past centuries the word has been frequently used - even the name Mowgli, the young hero of Rudyard Kipling’s </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jungle Book,</span><span class="font30"> is derived from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The empire was carved out of a number of regional states of India through conquests and political alliances between the Mughals and local chieftains. The founder of the empire, Zahiruddin Babur, was driven from his Central Asian homeland, Farghana, by the warring Uzbeks. He first established himself at Kabul and then in 1526 pushed further into the Indian subcontinent in search of territories and resources to satisfy the needs of the members of his clan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">His successor, Nasiruddin Humayun (1530-40, 1555-56) expanded the frontiers of the empire, but lost it to the Afghan leader Sher Shah Sur, who drove him into exile. Humayun took refuge in the court of the Safavid ruler of Iran. In 1555 Humayun defeated the Surs, but died a year later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Many consider Jalaluddin Akbar (1556-1605) the greatest of all the Mughal emperors, for he not only expanded but also consolidated his empire, making it the largest, strongest and richest kingdom of his time. Akbar succeeded in extending the frontiers of the empire to the Hindukush mountains, and checked the expansionist designs of the Uzbeks of Turan (Central Asia) and the Safavids of Iran. Akbar had three fairly able successors in Jahangir (1605-27), Shah Jahan (1628-58) and Aurangzeb (1658-1707), much as their characters varied. Under them the territorial expansion continued, though at a much reduced pace. The three rulers maintained and consolidated the various instruments of governance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the institutions of an imperial structure were created. These included effective methods of administration and taxation. The visible centre of Mughal power was the court. Here political alliances and relationships were forged, status and hierarchies defined. The political system devised by the Mughals was based on a combination of military power and conscious policy to accommodate the different traditions they encountered in the subcontinent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">After 1707, following the death of Aurangzeb, the power of the dynasty diminished. In place of the vast apparatus of empire controlled from Delhi, Agra or Lahore - the different capital cities - regional powers acquired greater autonomy. Yet symbolically the prestige of the Mughal ruler did not lose its aura. In 1857 the last scion of this dynasty, Bahadur Shah Zafar II, was overthrown by the British.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Chronicles commissioned by the Mughal emperors are an important source for studying the empire and its court. They were written in order to project a vision of an enlightened kingdom to all those who came under its umbrella. At the same time they were meant to convey to those who resisted the rule of the Mughals that all resistance was destined to fail. Also, the rulers wanted to ensure that there was an account of their rule for posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The authors of Mughal chronicles were invariably courtiers. The histories they wrote focused on events centred on the ruler, his family, the court and nobles, wars and administrative arrangements. Their titles, such as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nama, Shahjahan Nairn, Alamgir Nama,</span><span class="font30"> that is, the story of Akbar, Shah Jahan and Alamgir (a title of the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb), suggest that in the eyes of their authors the history of the empire and the court was synonymous with that of the emperor.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>2.1 From Turkish to Persian</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Mughal court chronicles were written in Persian. Under the Sultans of Delhi it flourished as a language of the court and of literary writings, alongside north Indian languages, especially Hindavi and its regional variants. As the Mughals were Chaghtai Turks by origin, Turkish was their mother tongue. Their first ruler Babur wrote poetry and his memoirs in this language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">It was Akbar who consciously set out to make Persian the leading language of the Mughal court. Cultural and intellectual contacts with Iran, as well as a regular stream of Iranian and Central Asian migrants seeking positions at the Mughal court, might have motivated the emperor to adopt the language. Persian was elevated to a language of empire, conferring power and prestige on those who had a command of it. It was spoken by the king, the royal household and the elite at court. Further, it became the language of administration at all levels so that accountants, clerks and other functionaries also learnt it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Even when Persian was not directly used, its vocabulary and idiom heavily influenced the language of official records in Rajasthani and Marathi and even Tamil. Since the people using Persian in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries came from many different regions of the subcontinent and spoke other Indian languages, Persian too became Indianised by absorbing local idioms. A new language, Urdu, sprang from the interaction of Persian with Hindavi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Mughal chronicles such as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nama</span><span class="font30"> were written in Persian, others, like Babur’s memoirs, were translated from the Turkish into the Persian </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Babur Nama.</span><span class="font30"> Translations of Sanskrit texts such as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ramayana</span><span class="font30"> into Persian were commissioned by the Mughal emperors. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata</span><span class="font30"> was translated as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Razmnama </span><span class="font30">(Book of Wars).</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>2.2 The making of manuscripts</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">All books in Mughal India were manuscripts, that is, they were handwritten. The centre of manuscript production was the imperial </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kitabkhana.</span><span class="font30"> Although </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">kitabkhana</span><span class="font30"> can be translated as library, it was a scriptorium, that is, a place where the emperor’s collection of manuscripts was kept and new manuscripts were produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The creation of a manuscript involved a number of people performing a variety of tasks. Paper makers were needed to prepare the folios of the manuscript, scribes or calligraphers to copy the text, gilders to illuminate the pages, painters to illustrate scenes</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The flight of the written word</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">In Abu’l Fazl’s words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The written word may embody the wisdom of bygone ages and may become a means to intellectual progress. The spoken word goes to the heart of those who are present to hear it. The written word gives wisdom to those who are near and far. If it was not for the written word, the spoken word would soon die, and no keepsake would be left us from those who are passed away. Superficial observers see in the letter a dark figure, but the deep-sighted see in it a lamp of wisdom </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">(chirag-i shinasai). </span><span class="font50">The written word looks black, notwithstanding the thousand rays within it, or it is a light with a mole on it that wards off the evil eye. A letter </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">(khat)</span><span class="font50"> is the portrait of wisdom; a rough sketch from the realm of ideas; a dark light ushering in day; a black cloud pregnant with knowledge; speaking though dumb; stationary yet travelling; stretched on the sheet, and yet soaring upwards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29">The calligrapher has signed his name on the lower section of the page, taking up almost one-fourth of Its space.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">from the text, bookbinders to gather the individual folios and set them within ornamental covers. The finished manuscript was seen as a precious object, a work of intellectual wealth and beauty. It exemplified the power of its patron, the Mughal emperor, to bring such beauty into being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">At the same time some of the people involved in the actual production of the manuscript also got recognition in the form of titles and awards. Of these, calligraphers and painters held a high social standing while others, such as paper makers or bookbinders, have remained anonymous artisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Calligraphy, the art of handwriting, was considered a skill of great importance. It was practised using different styles. Akbar’s favourite was the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">nastallq,</span><span class="font30"> a fluid style with long horizontal strokes. It is written using a piece of trimmed reed with a tip of five to 10 mm called </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">qalam,</span><span class="font30"> dipped in carbon ink </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(siyahi).</span><span class="font30"> The nib of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">qalam</span><span class="font30"> is usually split in the middle to facilitate the absorption of ink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">O Discuss...</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In what ways do you think the production of books today is similar to or different from the ways in which Mughal chronicles were produced?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font41" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>3.</span><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> The Painted Image</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">As we read in the previous section, painters too were involved in the production of Mughal manuscripts. Chronicles narrating the events of a Mughal emperor’s reign contained, alongside the written text, images that described an event in visual form. When scenes or themes in a book were to be given visual expression, the scribe left blank spaces on nearby pages; paintings, executed separately by artists, were inserted to accompany what was described in words. These paintings were miniatures, and could therefore be passed around for viewing and mounting on the pages of manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Paintings served not only to enhance the beauty of a book, but were believed to possess special powers of communicating ideas about the kingdom and the power of kings in ways that the written medium could not. The historian Abu’l Fazl described painting as a “magical art”: in his view it had the power to make inanimate objects look as if they possessed life.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font30">The production of paintings portraying the emperor, his court and the people who were part of it, was a source of constant tension between rulers and representatives of the Muslim orthodoxy, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ulama.</span><span class="font30"> The latter did not fail to invoke the Islamic prohibition of the portrayal of human beings enshrined in the Qur’an as well as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">hadis,</span><span class="font30"> which described an incident from the life of the Prophet Muhammad. Here the Prophet is cited as having forbidden the depiction of living beings in a naturalistic manner as it would suggest that the artist was seeking to appropriate the power of creation. This was a function that was believed to belong exclusively to God.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font30">O Identify the different tasks involved in the production of a Mughal manuscript depicted in this miniature.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font50">Abu’l Fazl held the art of painting in high esteem:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Drawing the likeness of anything is called </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">taswir.</span><span class="font50"> His Majesty from his earliest youth, has shown a great predilection for this art, and gives it every encouragement, as he looks upon it as a means both of study and amusement. A very large number of painters have been set to work. Each week, several supervisors and clerks of the imperial workshop submit before the emperor the work done by each artist, and His Majesty gives a reward and increases the monthly salaries of the artists according to the excellence displayed. ... Most excellent painters are now to be found, and masterpieces, worthy of a Bihzad, may be placed at the side of the wonderful works of the European painters who have attained worldwide fame. The minuteness in detail, the general finish and the boldness of execution now observed in pictures are incomparable; even inanimate objects look as if they have life. More than a hundred painters have become famous masters of the art. This is especially true of the Hindu artists. Their pictures surpass our conception of things. Few, indeed, in the whole world are found equal to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">O Why did AbuT Fazl consider the art of painting important? How did he seek to legitimise this art?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Yet interpretations of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sharVa</span><span class="font30"> changed with time. The body of Islamic tradition was interpreted in different ways by various social groups. Frequently each group put forward an understanding of tradition that would best suit their political needs. Muslim rulers in many Asian regions during centuries of empire building regularly commissioned artists to paint their portraits and scenes of life in their kingdoms. The Safavid kings of Iran, for example, patronised the finest artists, who were trained in workshops set up at court. The names of painters -such as that of Bihzad - contributed to spreading the cultural fame of the Safavid court far and wide.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font31">O Discuss...</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Compare the painter’s representation (Fig. 9.4) of literary and artistic production with that of Abu’l Fazl (Source 1).</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Artists from Iran also made their way to Mughal India. Some were brought to the Mughal court, as in the case of Mir Sayyid Ali and Abdus Samad, who were made to accompany Emperor Humayun to Delhi. Others migrated in search of opportunities to win patronage and prestige. A conflict between the emperor and the spokesmen of orthodox Muslim opinion on the question of visual representations of living beings was a source of tension at the Mughal court. Akbar’s court historian Abu’l Fazl cites the emperor as saying: “There are many that hate painting, but such men I dislike. It appears to me that an artist has a unique way of recognising God when he must come to feel that he cannot bestow life on his work ...”</span></p>

Nama</span><span class="font30"> (The Chronicle of a King) are the most well known. Each manuscript contained an average of 150 full- or double-page paintings of battles, sieges, hunts, building construction, court scenes, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The author of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nama,</span><span class="font30"> Abu’l Fazl grew up in the Mughal capital of Agra. He was widely read in Arabic, Persian, Greek philosophy and Sufism. Moreover, he was a forceful debater and independent thinker who consistently opposed the views of the conservative </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ularna.</span><span class="font30"> These qualities impressed Akbar, who found Abu’l Fazl ideally suited as an adviser and a spokesperson for his policies. One major</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">objective of the emperor was to free the state from the control of religious orthodoxy. In his role as court historian, Abu’l Fazl both shaped and articulated the ideas associated with the reign of Akbar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Beginning in 1589, Abu’l Fazl worked on the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nama</span><span class="font30"> for thirteen years, repeatedly revising the draft. The chronicle is based on a range of sources, including actual records of events </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(waqai),</span><span class="font30"> official documents and oral testimonies of knowledgeable persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nama</span><span class="font30"> is divided into three books of which the first two are chronicles. The third book is the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain-i Akbart</span><span class="font30"> The first volume contains the history of mankind from Adam to one celestial cycle of Akbar’s life (30 years). The second volume closes in the fortysixth regnal year (1601) of Akbar. The very next year Abu’l Fazl fell victim to a conspiracy hatched by Prince Salim, and was murdered by his accomplice, Bir Singh Bundela.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nama</span><span class="font30"> was written to provide a detailed description of Akbar’s reign in the traditional diachronic sense of recording politically significant events across time, as well as in the more novel sense of giving a synchronic picture of all aspects of Akbar’s empire - geographic, social, administrative and cultural - without reference to chronology. In the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ain-i Akbari</span><span class="font30"> the Mughal Empire is presented as having a diverse population consisting of Hindus, Jainas, Buddhists and Muslims and a composite culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Abu’l Fazl wrote in a language that was ornate and which attached importance to diction and rhythm, as texts were often read aloud. This IndoPersian style was patronised at court, and there were a large number of writers who wanted to write like Abu’l Fazl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A pupil of Abu’l Fazl, Abdul Hamid Lahori is known as the author of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Badshah Nama.</span><span class="font30"> Emperor Shah Jahan, hearing of his talents, commissioned him to write a history of his reign modelled on the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nama.</span><span class="font30"> The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Badshah. Nama</span><span class="font30"> is this official history in three volumes </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(daftars)</span><span class="font30"> of ten lunar years each. Lahori wrote the first and second </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">daftars </span><span class="font30">comprising the first two decades of the emperor’s rule (1627-47); these volumes were later revised by Sadullah Khan, Shah Jahan’s </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">wazir.</span><span class="font30"> Infirmities of old age prevented Lahori from proceeding with the third decade which was then chronicled by the historian Waris.</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The transmission of notions of luminosity </span><span class="font50">The origins of Suhrawardi’s philosophy went back to Plato’s </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Republic,</span><span class="font50"> where God is represented by the symbol of the sun. Suhrawardi’s writings were universally read in the Islamic world. They were studied by Shaikh Mubarak, who transmitted their ideas to his sons, Faizi and Abu’l Fazl, who were trained under him.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Court chroniclers drew upon many sources to show that the power of the Mughal kings came directly from God. One of the legends they narrated was that of the Mongol queen Alanqua, who was impregnated by a ray of sunshine while resting in her tent. The offspring she bore carried this Divine Light and passed it on from generation to generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Abu’l Fazl placed Mughal kingship as the highest station in the hierarchy of objects receiving light emanating from God </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(farr-i izadi).</span><span class="font30"> Here he was inspired by a famous Iranian sufi, Shihabuddin Suhrawardi (d. 1191) who first developed this idea. According to this idea, there was a hierarchy in which the Divine Light was transmitted to the king who then became the source of spiritual guidance for his subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Paintings that accompanied the narrative of the chronicles transmitted these ideas in a way that</span></p>

<p><span class="font29">Akbar is dressed In white, associated in sufi traditions with the enlightened soul. He proffers a globe, symbolic of dynastic authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">In the Mughal empire there was no law laying down which of the emperor's sons would succeed to the throne. This meant that every dynastic change was accompanied and decided by a fratricidal war. Towards the end of Akbar's reign, Prince Salim revolted against his father, seized power and assumed the title of Jahangir.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>5.2 A unifying force</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Mughal chronicles present the empire as comprising many different ethnic and religious communities -Hindus, Jainas, Zoroastrians and Muslims. As the source of all peace and stability the emperor stood above all religious and ethnic groups, mediated among them, and ensured that justice and peace prevailed. Abu’l Fazl describes the ideal of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sulh-i kul </span><span class="font30">(absolute peace) as the cornerstone of enlightened rule. In </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sulh-i kul</span><span class="font30"> all religions and schools of thought had freedom of expression but on condition that they did not undermine the authority of the state or fight among themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The ideal of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sulh.-i kul</span><span class="font30"> was implemented through state policies - the nobility under the Mughals was a composite one comprising Iranis, Turanis, Afghans, Rajputs, Deccanis - all of whom were given positions and awards purely on the basis of their service and</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">loyalty to the king. Further, Akbar abolished the tax on pilgrimage in 1563 and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jizya </span><span class="font30">in 1564 as the two were based on religious discrimination. Instructions were sent to officers of the empire to follow the precept of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">suih-i kul </span><span class="font30">in administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">All Mughal emperors gave grants to support the building and maintenance of places of worship. Even when temples were destroyed during war, grants were later issued for their repair - as we know from the reigns of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. However, during the reign of the latter, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jizya</span><span class="font30"> was reimposed on non-Muslim subjects.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Abu’l Fazl defined sovereignty as a social contract: the emperor protects the four essences of his subjects, namely, life </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(jan),</span><span class="font30"> property </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(mat),</span><span class="font30"> honour </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(namus)</span><span class="font30"> and faith </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(din),</span><span class="font30"> and in return demands obedience and a share of resources.

<p><span class="font29">After my accession, the first order that I gave was for the fastening up of the Chain of Justice, so that If those engaged In the administration of justice should delay or practise hypocrisy In the matter of those seeking justice, the oppressed might come to this chain and shake It so that Its noise might attract attention. The chain was made of pure gold, 30 </span><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">gaz</span><span class="font29"> In length and containing 60 bells.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">A number of symbols were created for visual representation of the idea of justice which came to stand for the highest virtue of Mughal monarchy. One of the favourite symbols used by artists was the motif of the lion and the lamb (or goat) peacefully nestling next to each other. This was meant to signify a realm where both the strong and the weak could exist in harmony. Court scenes from the illustrated </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Badshah Nairn</span><span class="font30"> place such motifs in a niche directly below the emperor’s throne (see Fig. 9.6).</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The heart of the Mughal Empire was its capital city, where the court assembled. The capital cities of the Mughals frequently shifted during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Babur took over the Lodi capital of Agra, though during the four years of his reign the court was frequently on the move. During the 1560s Akbar had the fort of Agra constructed with red sandstone quarried from the adjoining regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the 1570s he decided to build a new capital, Fatehpur Sikri. One of the reasons prompting this may have been that Sikri was located on the direct road to Ajmer, where the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">dargah.</span><span class="font30"> of Shaikh Muinuddin Chishti had become an important pilgrimage centre. The Mughal emperors entered into a close relationship with sufis of the Chishti </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">silsila.</span><span class="font30"> Akbar commissioned the</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">construction of a white marble tomb for Shaikh Salim Chishti next to the majestic Friday mosque at Sikri. The enormous arched gateway (Buland Darwaza) was meant to remind visitors of the Mughal victory in Gujarat. In 1585 the capital was transferred to Lahore to bring the north-west under greater control and Akbar closely watched the frontier for thirteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Shah Jahan pursued sound fiscal policies and accumulated enough money to indulge his passion for building. Building activity in monarchical cultures, as you have seen in the case of earlier rulers, was the most visible and tangible sign of dynastic power, wealth and prestige. In the case of Muslim rulers it was also considered an act of piety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In 1648 the court, army and household moved from Agra to the newly completed imperial capital, Shahjahanabad. It was a new addition to the old residential city of Delhi, with the Red Fort, the Jama Masjid, a tree-lined esplanade with bazaars (Chandni Chowk) and spacious homes for the nobility. Shah Jahan’s new city was appropriate to a more formal vision of a grand monarchy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The physical arrangement of the court, focused on the sovereign, mirrored his status as the heart of society. Its centrepiece was therefore the throne, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">takht,</span><span class="font30"> which gave physical form to the function of the sovereign as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">axis mundi.</span><span class="font30"> The canopy, a symbol of kingship in India for a millennium, was believed to separate the radiance of the sun from that of the sovereign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Chronicles lay down with great precision the rules defining status amongst the Mughal elites. In court, status was determined by spatial proximity to the king. The place accorded to a courtier by the ruler was a sign of his importance in the eyes of the emperor. Once the emperor sat on the throne, no one was permitted to move from his position or to leave without permission. Social control in court society was exercised through carefully defining in</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">Abu’l Fazl gives a vivid account of Akbar’s darbar:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Whenever His Majesty (Akbar) holds court </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">(darbar) </span><span class="font50">a large drum is beaten, the sounds of which are accompanied by Divine praise. In this manner, people of all classes receive notice. His Majesty’s sons and grandchildren, the grandees of the Court, and all other men who have admittance, attend to make the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">kornish,</span><span class="font50"> and remain standing in their proper places. Learned men of renown and skilful mechanics pay their respects; and the officers of justice present their reports. His Majesty, with his usual insights, gives orders, and settles everything in a satisfactory manner. During the whole time, skilful gladiators and wrestlers from all countries hold themselves in readiness, and singers, male and female, are in waiting. Clever jugglers and funny tumblers also are anxious to exhibit their dexterity and agility.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Kornish</span><span class="font30"> was a form of ceremonial salutation in which the courtier placed the palm of his right hand against his forehead and bent his head. It suggested that the subject placed his head - the seat of the senses and the mind - into the hand of humility, presenting it to the royal assembly</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The forms of salutation to the ruler indicated the person’s status in the hierarchy: deeper prostration represented higher status. The highest form of submission was </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sijda</span><span class="font30"> or complete prostration. Under Shah Jahan these rituals were replaced with </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">chahar taslim</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">zaminbos</span><span class="font30"> (kissing the ground).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The protocols governing diplomatic envoys at the Mughal court were equally explicit. An ambassador presented to the Mughal emperor was expected to offer an acceptable form of greeting - either by bowing deeply or kissing the ground, or else to follow the Persian custom of clasping one’s hands in front of the chest. Thomas Roe, the English envoy of James I, simply bowed before Jahangir according to European custom, and further shocked the court by demanding a chair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The emperor began his day at sunrise with personal religious devotions or prayers, and then appeared on a small balcony, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jharoka,</span><span class="font30"> facing the east.

<p><span class="font30">The granting of titles to men of merit was an important aspect of Mughal polity. A man’s ascent in the court hierarchy could be traced through the titles he held. The title Asaf Khan for one of the highest ministers originated with Asaf, the legendary minister of the prophet king Sulaiman (Solomon). The title Mirza Raja was accorded by Aurangzeb to his two highest-ranking nobles, Jai Singh and Jaswant Singh. Titles could be earned or paid for.

The lotus blossom set with jewels </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(padma murassa)</span><span class="font30"> was given only in exceptional circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">A courtier never approached the emperor empty handed: he offered either a small sum of money </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(nazr)</span><span class="font30"> or a large amount </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(peshkash).</span><span class="font30"> In diplomatic relations, gifts were regarded as a sign of honour and respect. Ambassadors performed the important function of negotiating treaties and relationships between competing political powers. In such a context gifts had an important symbolic role. Thomas Roe was disappointed when a ring he had presented to Asaf Khan was returned to him for the reason that it was worth merely 400 rupees.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The term “harem” is frequently used to refer to the domestic world of the Mughals. It originates in the Persian word </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">haram,</span><span class="font30"> meaning a sacred place. The Mughal household consisted of the emperor’s wives and concubines, his near and distant relatives (mother, step- and foster-mothers, sisters, daughters, daughters-in-law, aunts, children, etc.), and female servants and slaves. Polygamy was practised widely in the Indian subcontinent, especially among the ruling groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Both for the Rajput clans as well as the Mughals marriage was a way of cementing political relationships and forging alliances. The gift of territory was often accompanied by the gift of a daughter in marriage. This ensured a continuing hierarchical relationship between ruling groups. It was through the link of marriage and the relationships that developed as a result that the Mughals were able to form a vast kinship network that linked them to important groups and helped to hold a vast empire together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the Mughal household a distinction was maintained between wives who came from royal families </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(begams),</span><span class="font30"> and other wives </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(aghas)</span><span class="font30"> who were not of noble birth. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">begams,</span><span class="font30"> married after receiving huge amounts of cash and valuables as dower </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(mahr),</span><span class="font30"> naturally received a higher status and greater attention from their husbands than did </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">aghas.</span><span class="font30"> The concubines </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(aghacha</span><span class="font30"> or the lesser </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">agha) </span><span class="font30">occupied the lowest position in the hierarchy of females intimately related to royalty. They all received monthly allowances in cash, supplemented with gifts according to their status. The lineagebased family structure was not entirely static. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">agha</span><span class="font30"> and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">aghacha</span><span class="font30"> could rise to the position of a </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">begam</span><span class="font30"> depending on the husband’s will, and provided that he did not already have four wives. Love and motherhood played important roles in elevating such women to the status of legally wedded wives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Apart from wives, numerous male and female slaves populated the Mughal household. The tasks they performed varied from the most mundane to those requiring skill, tact and intelligence. Slave eunuchs </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(khwajasara)</span><span class="font30"> moved between the external and internal life of the household as guards, servants, and also as agents for women dabbling in commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">After Nur Jahan, Mughal queens and princesses began to control significant financial resources. Shah Jahan’s daughters Jahanara and Roshanara enjoyed an annual income often equal to that of high imperial </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mansabdars.</span><span class="font30"> Jahanara, in addition, received revenues from the port city of Surat, which was a lucrative centre of overseas trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Control over resources enabled important women of the Mughal household to commission buildings and gardens. Jahanara participated in many architectural projects of Shah Jahan’s new capital, Shahjahanabad (Delhi). Among these was an imposing double-storeyed caravanserai with a courtyard and garden. The bazaar of Chandni Chowk, the throbbing centre of Shahjahanabad, was designed by Jahanara.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">An interesting book giving us a glimpse into the domestic world of the Mughals is the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Humayun Nama</span><span class="font30"> written by Gulbadan Begum. Gulbadan was the daughter of Babur, Humayun’s sister and Akbar’s aunt. Gulbadan could write fluently in Turkish and Persian. When Akbar commissioned Abu’l Fazl to write a history of his reign, he requested his aunt to record her memoirs of earlier times under Babur and Humayun, for Abu’l Fazl to draw upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">What Gulbadan wrote was no eulogy of the Mughal emperors. Rather she described in great detail the conflicts and tensions among the princes and kings and the important mediating role elderly women of the family played in resolving some of these conflicts.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;">8.1 Recruitment and rank</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Mughal chronicles, especially the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Akbar Nairn,</span><span class="font30"> have bequeathed a vision of empire in which agency rests almost solely with the emperor, while the rest of the kingdom has been portrayed as following his orders. Yet if we look more closely at the rich information these histories provide about the apparatus of the Mughal state, we may be able to understand the ways in which the imperial organisation was dependent on several different institutions to be able to function effectively. One important pillar of the Mughal state was its corps of officers, also referred to by historians collectively as the nobility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The nobility was recruited from diverse ethnic and religious groups. This ensured that no faction was large enough to challenge the authority of the state. The officer corps of the Mughals was described as a bouquet of flowers </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(guldasta)</span><span class="font30"> held together by loyalty to the emperor. In Akbar’s imperial service, Turani and Iranian nobles were present from the earliest phase of carving out a political dominion. Many had accompanied Humayun; others migrated later to the Mughal court.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Mughal nobility</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This is how Chandrabhan Barahman described the Mughal nobility in his book </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Char Chaman</span><span class="font50"> (Four Gardens), written during the reign of Shah Jahan:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">People from many races (Arabs, Iranians, Turks, Tajiks, Kurds, Tatars, Russians, Abyssinians, and so on) and from many countries (Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Arabia, Iran, Khurasan, Turan) - in fact, different groups and classes of people from all societies - have sought refuge in the imperial court, as well as different groups from India, men with knowledge and skills as well as warriors, for example, Bukharis and Bhakkaris, Saiyyads of genuine lineage, Shaikhzadas with noble ancestry, Afghan tribes such as the Lodis, Rohillas, Yusufzai, and castes of Rajputs, who were to be addressed as </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">rana, raja, rao</span><span class="font50"> and </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">rayan -</span><span class="font50"> i.e. Rathor, Sisodia, Kachhwaha, Hada, Gaur, Chauhan, Panwar, Bhaduriya, Solanki, Bundela, Shekhawat, and all the other Indian tribes, such as Ghakkar, Khokar, Baluchi, and others who wielded the sword, and </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">mansabs</span><span class="font50"> from 100 to 7000 </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">zat,</span><span class="font50"> likewise landowners from the steppes and mountains, from the regions of Karnataka, Bengal, Assam, Udaipur, Srinagar, Kumaon, Tibet and Kishtwar and so on - whole tribes and groups of them have been privileged to kiss the threshold of the imperial court (i.e. attend the court or find employment).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Two ruling groups of Indian origin entered the imperial service from 1560 onwards: the Rajputs and the Indian Muslims (Shaikhzadas). The first to join was a Rajput chief, Raja Bharmal Kachhwaha of Amber, to whose daughter Akbar got married. Members of Hindu castes inclined towards education and accountancy were also promoted, a famous example being Akbar’s finance minister, Raja Todar Mal, who belonged to the Khatri caste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Iranians gained high offices under Jahangir, whose politically influential queen, Nur Jahan (d. 1645), was an Iranian. Aurangzeb appointed Rajputs to high positions, and under him the Marathas accounted for a sizeable number within the body of officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">All holders of government offices held ranks </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(mansabs)</span><span class="font30"> comprising two numerical designations: </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">zat</span><span class="font30"> which was an indicator of position in the imperial hierarchy and the salary of the official </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(mansabdar),</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sawar</span><span class="font30"> which indicated the number of horsemen he was required to maintain in service. In the seventeenth century, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mansabdars </span><span class="font30">of 1,000 </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">zat</span><span class="font30"> or above ranked as nobles </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(umara, </span><span class="font30">which is the plural of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">amir).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The nobles participated in military campaigns with their armies and also served as officers of the empire in the provinces. Each military commander recruited, equipped and trained the main striking arm of the Mughal army, the cavalry. The troopers maintained superior horses branded on the flank by the imperial mark </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(dagh).</span><span class="font30"> The emperor personally reviewed changes in rank, titles and official postings for all except the lowest-ranked officers. Akbar, who designed the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mansab</span><span class="font30"> system, also established spiritual relationships with a select band of his nobility by treating them as his disciples </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(murid).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">For members of the nobility, imperial service was a way of acquiring power, wealth and the highest possible reputation. A person wishing to join the service petitioned through a noble, who presented a </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">tcgwiz</span><span class="font30"> to the emperor. If the applicant was found suitable a </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mansab</span><span class="font30"> was granted to him. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mir bakhshi</span><span class="font30"> (paymaster general) stood in open court on the right of the emperor and presented all candidates for appointment or promotion, while his office prepared orders bearing his seal and signature as well as those of the emperor. There were two other important ministers at the centre: the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">diwan-i ala </span><span class="font30">(finance minister) and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sadr-us sudur</span><span class="font30"> (minister of grants or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">madad-i rnaash,</span><span class="font30"> and in charge of appointing local judges or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">qazis).</span><span class="font30"> The three ministers occasionally came together as an advisory body, but were independent of each other. Akbar with these and other advisers shaped the administrative, fiscal and monetary institutions of the empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The keeping of exact and detailed records was a major concern of the Mughal administration. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mir bakhshi</span><span class="font30"> supervised the corps of court writers </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(waqia nawis)</span><span class="font30"> who recorded all applications and documents presented to the court, and all imperial orders </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(Jarman).</span><span class="font30"> In addition, agents </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(wakil)</span><span class="font30"> of nobles and regional rulers recorded the entire proceedings of the court under the heading “News from the Exalted Court” </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(Akhbarat-i Darbar-i Mualla)</span><span class="font30"> with the date and time of the court session </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(pahar).</span><span class="font30"> The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">akhbarat </span><span class="font30">contained all kinds of information such as attendance at the court, grant of offices and titles, diplomatic missions, presents received, or the enquiries made by the emperor about the health of an officer. This information is valuable for writing the history of the public and private lives of kings and nobles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">News reports and important official documents travelled across the length and breadth of the regions under Mughal rule by imperial post. Round-the-clock relays of foot-runners </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(qasid</span><span class="font30"> or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">pathmar)</span><span class="font30"> carried papers rolled up in bamboo containers. The emperor received reports from even distant provincial capitals within a few days. Agents of nobles posted outside the capital and Rajput princes and tributary rulers all assiduously copied these announcements and sent their contents by messenger back to their masters. The empire was connected by a surprisingly rapid information loop for public news.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>8.3 Beyond the centre: provincial administration</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The division of functions established at the centre was replicated in the provinces </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(subas)</span><span class="font30"> where the ministers had their corresponding subordinates </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(diwan, bakhshi</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sadr).</span><span class="font30"> The head of the provincial administration was the governor </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(subadar)</span><span class="font30"> who reported directly to the emperor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">sarkars,</span><span class="font30"> into which each </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">suba</span><span class="font30"> was divided, often overlapped with the jurisdiction of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">faujdars </span><span class="font30">(commandants) who were deployed with contingents of heavy cavalry and musketeers in districts. The local administration was looked after at the level of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">pargana</span><span class="font30"> (sub-district) by three semi-hereditary officers, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">qanungo</span><span class="font30"> (keeper of revenue records), the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Chaudhuri</span><span class="font30"> (in charge of revenue collection) and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">qazi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Each department of administration maintained a large support staff of clerks, accountants, auditors, messengers, and other functionaries who were technically qualified officials, functioning in accordance with standardised rules and procedures, and generating copious written orders and records. Persian was made the language of administration throughout, but local languages were used for village accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Mughal chroniclers usually portrayed the emperor and his court as controlling the entire administrative apparatus down to the village level. Yet, as you have seen (Chapter 8), this could hardly have been a process free of tension. The relationship between local landed magnates, the zamindars, and the representatives of the Mughal emperor was sometimes marked by conflicts over authority and a share of the resources. The zamindars often succeeded in mobilising peasant support against the state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Writers of chronicles list many high-sounding titles assumed by the Mughal emperors. These included general titles such as Shahenshah (King of Kings) or specific titles assumed by individual kings upon ascending the throne, such as Jahangir (World-Seizer), or Shah Jahan (King of the World). The chroniclers often drew on these titles and their meanings to reiterate the claims of the Mughal emperors to uncontested territorial and political control. Yet the same contemporary histories </span><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">Fig.</span><span class="font30"> 9j5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide accounts of diplomatic relationships and</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>9.1 The Safavids and Qandahar</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The political and diplomatic relations between the Mughal kings and the neighbouring countries of Iran and Turan hinged on the control of the frontier defined by the Hindukush mountains that separated Afghanistan from the regions of Iran and Central Asia. All conquerors who sought to make their way into the Indian subcontinent had to cross the Hindukush to have access to north India. A constant aim of Mughal policy was to ward off this potential danger by controlling strategic outposts - notably Kabul and Qandahar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Qandahar was a bone of contention between the Safavids and the Mughals. The fortress-town had initially been in the possession of</span></p>

Abu'l Hasan painted this scene portraying the two rulers - Jahangir and the Safavld Shah Abbas - In friendly embrace. Both kings are depicted In their traditional costumes. The figure of the Shah Is based upon portraits made by Blshandas who accompanied the Mughal embassy to Iran In 1613.

The ill-prepared Mughal garrison was defeated and had to surrender the fortress and the city to the Safavids.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The relationship between the Mughals and the Ottomans was marked by the concern to ensure free movement for merchants and pilgrims in the territories under Ottoman control. This was especially true for the Hijaz, that part of Ottoman Arabia where the important pilgrim centres of Mecca and Medina were located. The Mughal emperor usually combined religion and commerce by exporting valuable merchandise to Aden and Mokha, both Red Sea ports, and distributing the proceeds of the sales in charity to the keepers of shrines and religious men there. However, when Aurangzeb discovered cases of misappropriation of funds sent to Arabia, he favoured their distribution in India which, he thought, “was as much a house of God as Mecca”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">In the account of his experiences, Monserrate, who was a member of the first Jesuit mission, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">It is hard to exaggerate how accessible he (Akbar) makes himself to all who wish audience of him. For he creates an opportunity almost every day for any of the common people or of the nobles to see him and to converse with him; and he endeavours to show himself pleasant-spoken and affable rather than severe towards all who come to speak with him. It is very remarkable how great an effect this courtesy and affability has in attaching him to the minds of his subjects. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-----</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>9.3 Jesuits at the Mughal court</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Europe received knowledge of India through the accounts of Jesuit missionaries, travellers, merchants and diplomats. The Jesuit accounts are the earliest impressions of the Mughal court ever recorded by European writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Following the discovery of a direct sea route to India at the end of the fifteenth century, Portuguese merchants established a network of trading stations in coastal cities. The Portuguese king was also interested in the propagation of Christianity with the help of the missionaries of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). The Christian missions to India during the sixteenth century were part of this process of trade and empire building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Akbar was curious about Christianity and dispatched an embassy to Goa to invite Jesuit priests. The first Jesuit mission reached the Mughal court at Fatehpur Sikri in 1580 and stayed for about two years. The Jesuits spoke to Akbar about Christianity and debated its virtues with the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ulama. </span><span class="font30">Two more missions were sent to the Mughal court at Lahore, in 1591 and 1595.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Jesuit accounts are based on personal observation and shed light on the character and mind of the emperor. At public assemblies the Jesuits were assigned places in close proximity to Akbar’s throne. They accompanied him on his campaigns, tutored his children, and were often companions of his leisure hours. The Jesuit accounts corroborate the information given in Persian chronicles about state officials and the general conditions of life in Mughal times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">O Discuss...</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">What were the considerations that shaped the relations of the Mughal rulers with their contemporaries?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font54" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>10. </span><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Questioning Formal Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The high respect shown by Akbar towards the members of the Jesuit mission impressed them deeply. They interpreted the emperor’s open interest in the doctrines of Christianity as a sign of his acceptance of their faith. This can be understood in the light of the prevailing climate of religious intolerance in Western Europe. Monserrate remarked that “the king cared little that in allowing everyone to follow his religion he was in reality violating all”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Akbar’s quest for religious knowledge led to interfaith debates in the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ibadat khana</span><span class="font30"> at Fatehpur Sikri between learned Muslims, Hindus, Jainas, Parsis and Christians. Akbar’s religious views matured as he queried scholars of different religions and sects and gathered knowledge about their doctrines. Increasingly, he moved away from the orthodox Islamic ways of understanding religions towards a self-conceived eclectic form of divine worship focused on light and the sun. We have seen that Akbar and Abu’l Fazl created a philosophy of light and used it to shape the image of the king and ideology of the state. In this, a divinely inspired individual has supreme sovereignty over his people and complete control over his enemies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">In this chapter you will see what colonial rule meant to those who lived in the countryside. You will meet the zamindars of Bengal, travel to the Rajmahal hills where the Paharias and the Santhals lived, and then move west to the Deccan. You will look at the way the English East India Company (E.I.C.) established its raj in the countryside, implemented its revenue policies, what these policies meant to different sections of people, and how they changed everyday lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Laws introduced by the state have consequences for people: they determine to an extent who grows richer and who poorer, who acquires new land and who loses the land they have lived on, where peasants go when they need money. As you will see, however, people were not only subject to the working of laws, they also resisted the law by acting according to what they believed to be just. In doing so people defined the way in which laws operated, thereby modifying their consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">You will also come to know about the sources that tell us about these histories, and the problems historians face in interpreting them. You will read about revenue records and surveys, journals and accounts left by surveyors and travellers, and reports produced by enquiry commissions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">As you know, colonial rule was first established in Bengal. It is here that the earliest attempts were made to reorder rural society and establish a new regime of land rights and a new revenue system. Let us see what happened in Bengal in the early years of Company (E.I.C.) rule.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>1.1 An auction in Burdwan</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">In 1797 there was an auction in Burdwan (presentday Bardhaman). It was a big public event. A number of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mahals</span><span class="font30"> (estates) held by the Raja of Burdwan were being sold. The Permanent Settlement had come into operation in 1793. The East India Company had fixed the revenue that each zamindar had to pay. The estates of those who failed to pay were to be auctioned to recover the revenue. Since the raja had accumulated huge arrears, his estates had been put up for auction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Numerous purchasers came to the auction and the estates were sold to the highest bidder. But the Collector soon discovered a strange twist to the tale. Many of the purchasers turned out to be servants and agents of the raja who had bought the lands on behalf of their master. Over 95 per cent of the sale at the auction was fictitious. The raja’s estates had been publicly sold, but he remained in control of his zamindari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Why had the raja failed to pay the revenue? Who were the purchasers at the auction? What does the story tell us about what was happening in the rural areas of eastern India at that time?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>1.2 The problem of unpaid revenue</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The estates of the Burdwan raj were not the only ones sold during the closing years of the eighteenth century. Over 75 per cent of the zamindaris changed hands after the Permanent Settlement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In introducing the Permanent Settlement, British officials hoped to resolve the problems they had been facing since the conquest of Bengal. By the 1770s, the rural economy in Bengal was in crisis, with recurrent famines and declining agricultural output. Officials felt that agriculture, trade and the revenue resources of the state could all be developed by encouraging investment in agriculture. This could be done by securing rights of property and permanently fixing the rates of revenue demand. If the revenue demand of the state was permanently fixed, then the Company could look forward to a regular flow of revenue, while entrepreneurs could feel sure of earning a profit from their investment, since the state would not siphon it off by increasing its claim. The process, officials hoped, would lead to the emergence of a class of yeomen farmers and rich landowners who would have the capital and enterprise to improve agriculture. Nurtured by the British, this class would also be loyal to the Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The problem, however, lay in identifying individuals who could both improve agriculture and contract to pay the fixed revenue to the state. After a prolonged debate amongst Company officials, the Permanent Settlement was made with the rajas and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> of Bengal. They were now classified as zamindars, and they had to pay the revenue demand that was fixed in perpetuity. In terms of this definition, the zamindar was not a landowner in the village, but a revenue Collector of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Zamindars had several (sometimes as many as 400) villages under them. In Company calculations the villages within one zamindari formed one revenue estate. The Company fixed the total demand over the entire estate whose revenue the zamindar contracted to pay. The zamindar collected rent from the different villages, paid the revenue to the Company, and retained the difference as his income. He was expected to pay the Company regularly, failing which his estate could be auctioned.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>1.3 Why zamindars defaulted on payments</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Company officials felt that a fixed revenue demand would give zamindars a sense of security and, assured of returns on their investment, encourage them to improve their estates. In the early decades after the Permanent Settlement, however, zamindars regularly failed to pay the revenue demand and unpaid balances accumulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The reasons for this failure were various. First: the initial demands were very high. This was because it was felt that if the demand was fixed for all time to come, the Company would never be able to claim a share of increased income from land when prices rose and cultivation expanded. To minimise this anticipated loss, the Company pegged the revenue demand high, arguing that the burden on zamindars would gradually decline as agricultural production expanded and prices rose.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ryot</span><span class="font30"> is the way the term </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">raiyat, </span><span class="font30">used to designate peasants (Chapter 8), was spelt in British records. </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Ryots</span><span class="font30"> in Bengal did not always cultivate the land directly, but leased it out to under-ryots.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Second: this high demand was imposed in the 1790s, a time when the prices of agricultural produce were depressed, making it difficult for the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> to pay their dues to the zamindar. If the zamindar could not collect the rent, how could he pay the Company? Third: the revenue was invariable, regardless of the harvest, and had to be paid punctually. In fact, according to the Sunset Law, if payment did not come in by sunset of the specified date, the zamindari was liable to be auctioned. Fourth: the Permanent Settlement initially limited the power of the zamindar to collect rent from the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryot</span><span class="font30"> and manage his zamindari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The Company had recognised the zamindars as important, but it wanted to control and regulate them, subdue their authority and restrict their autonomy. The zamindars’ troops were disbanded, customs duties abolished, and their </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">“cutcheries”</span><span class="font30"> (courts) brought under the supervision of a Collector appointed by the Company. Zamindars lost their power to organise local justice and the local police. Over time the collectorate emerged as an alternative centre of authority, severely restricting what the zamindar could do. In one case, when a raja failed to pay the revenue, a Company official was speedily dispatched to his zamindari with explicit instructions “to take charge of the District and to use the most effectual means to destroy all the influence and the authority of the raja and his officers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">At the time of rent collection, an officer of the zamindar, usually the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">amlah,</span><span class="font30"> came around to the village. But rent collection was a perennial problem. Sometimes bad harvests and low prices made payment of dues difficult for the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots.</span><span class="font30"> At other times </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> deliberately delayed payment. Rich </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> and village headmen </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">-jotedars</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mandats -</span><span class="font30"> were only too happy to see the zamindar in trouble. The zamindar could therefore not easily assert his power over them. Zamindars could prosecute defaulters, but the judicial process was long drawn. In Burdwan alone there were over 30,000 pending suits for arrears of rent payment in 1798.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">While many zamindars were facing a crisis at the end of the eighteenth century, a group of rich peasants were consolidating their position in the villages. In Francis Buchanan’s survey of the Dinajpur district in North Bengal we have a vivid description of this class of rich peasants known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jotedars.</span><span class="font30"> By the early nineteenth century, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jotedars </span><span class="font30">had acquired vast areas of land - sometimes as much as several thousand acres. They controlled local trade as well as moneylending, exercising immense power over the poorer cultivators of the region. A large part of their land was cultivated through sharecroppers </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">(adhiyars</span><span class="font30"> or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">bargadars)</span><span class="font30"> who brought their own ploughs, laboured in the field, and handed over half the produce to the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jotedars</span><span class="font30"> after the harvest.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Within the villages, the power of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Jotedars</span><span class="font30"> was more effective than that of zamindars. Unlike zamindars who often lived in urban areas, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jotedars</span><span class="font30"> were located in the villages and exercised direct control over a considerable section of poor villagers. They fiercely resisted efforts by zamindars to increase the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jama</span><span class="font30"> of the village, prevented zamindari officials from executing their duties, mobilised </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots</span><span class="font30"> who were dependent on them, and deliberately delayed payments of revenue to the zamindar. In fact, when the estates of the zamindars were auctioned for failure to make revenue payment, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jotedars</span><span class="font30"> were often amongst the purchasers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jotedars</span><span class="font30"> were most powerful in North Bengal, although rich peasants and village headmen were emerging as commanding figures in the countryside in other parts of Bengal as well. In some places they were called </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">haoladars, </span><span class="font30">elsewhere they were known as </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">gantidars </span><span class="font30">or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">mandals.</span><span class="font30"> Their rise inevitably weakened zamindari authority.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The authority of the zamindars in rural areas, however, did not collapse. Faced with an exorbitantly high revenue demand and possible auction of their estates, they devised ways of surviving the pressures. New contexts produced new strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Fictitious sale was one such strategy. It involved a series of manoeuvres. The Raja of Burdwan, for instance, first transferred some of his zamindari to his mother, since the Company had decreed that the property of women would not be taken over. Then, as a second move, his agents manipulated the auctions. The revenue demand of the Company was deliberately withheld, and unpaid balances were allowed to accumulate. When a part of the estate was auctioned, the zamindar’s men bought the property, outbidding other purchasers. Subsequently they refused to pay up the purchase money, so that the estate had to be resold. Once again it was bought by the zamindar’s agents, once again the purchase money was not paid, and once again there was an auction. This process was repeated endlessly, exhausting the state, and the other bidders at the auction. At last the estate was sold at a low price back to the zamindar. The zamindar never paid the full revenue demand; the Company rarely recovered the unpaid balances that had piled up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Such transactions happened on a grand scale. Between 1793 and 1801 four big zamindaris of Bengal, including Burdwan, made </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">benami </span><span class="font30">purchases that collectively yielded as much as Rs 30 lakh. Of the total sales at the auctions, over 15 per cent were fictitious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">There were other ways in which zamindars circumvented displacement. When people from outside the zamindari bought an estate at an auction, they could not always take possession. At times their agents would be attacked by </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">lathyals</span><span class="font30"> of the former zamindar. Sometimes even the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ryots </span><span class="font30">resisted the entry of outsiders. They felt bound to their own zamindar through a sense of loyalty and perceived him as a figure of authority and themselves as his </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">proja</span><span class="font30"> (subjects). The sale of the zamindari disturbed their sense of identity, their pride. The zamindars therefore were not easily displaced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">By the beginning of the nineteenth century the depression in prices was over. Thus those who had survived the troubles of the 1790s consolidated their power. Rules of revenue payment were also made somewhat flexible. As a result, the zamindar’s power over the villages was strengthened. It was only during the Great Depression of the 1930s that they finally collapsed and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jotedars</span><span class="font30"> consolidated their power in the countryside.</span></p>
