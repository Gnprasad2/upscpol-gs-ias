<p><span class="font30">Late in the afternoon of 10 May 1857, the sepoys in the cantonment of Meerut broke out in mutiny. It began in the lines of the native infantry, spread very swiftly to the cavalry and then to the city. The ordinary people of the town and surrounding villages joined the sepoys. The sepoys captured the bell of arms where the arms and ammunition were kept and proceeded to attack white people, and to ransack and burn their bungalows and property. Government buildings - the record office, jail, court, post office, treasury, etc. - were destroyed and plundered. The telegraph line to Delhi was cut. As darkness descended, a group of sepoys rode off towards Delhi.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The sepoys arrived at the gates of the Red Fort early in the morning on 11 May. It was the month of Ramzan, the Muslim holy month of prayer and fasting. The old Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, had just finished his prayers and meal before the sun rose and the fast began. He heard the commotion at the gates. The sepoys who had gathered under his window told him: “We have come from Meerut after killing all the Englishmen there, because they asked us to bite bullets that were coated with the fat of cows and pigs with our teeth. This has corrupted the faith of Hindus and Muslims alike.” Another group of sepoys also entered Delhi, and the ordinary people of the city joined them. Europeans were killed in large numbers; the rich of Delhi were attacked and looted. It was clear that Delhi had gone out of British control. Some sepoys rode into the Red Fort, without observing the elaborate court etiquette expected of them. They demanded that the emperor give them his blessings. Surrounded by the sepoys, Bahadur Shah had no other option but to comply. The revolt thus acquired a kind of legitimacy because it could now be carried on in the name of the Mughal emperor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Through 12 and 13 May, North India remained quiet. Once word spread that Delhi had fallen to the rebels and Bahadur Shah had blessed the rebellion, events moved swiftly. Cantonment after cantonment in the Gangetic valley and some to the west of Delhi rose in mutiny.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">If one were to place the dates of these mutinies in chronological order, it would appear that as the news of the mutiny in one town travelled to the next the sepoys there took up arms. The sequence of events in every cantonment followed a similar pattern.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>1.1 How the mutinies began</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The sepoys began their action with a signal: in many places it was the firing of the evening gun or the sounding of the bugle. They first seized the bell of arms and plundered the treasury. They then attacked government buildings - the jail, treasury, telegraph office, record room, bungalows - burning all records. Everything and everybody connected with the white man became a target. Proclamations in Hindi, Urdu and Persian were put up in the cities calling upon the population, both Hindus and Muslims, to unite, rise and exterminate the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">firangis.</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Bell of arms</span><span class="font30"> is a storeroom in which weapons are kept.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Firangi,</span><span class="font30"> a term of Persian origin, possibly derived from Frank (from which France gets its name), is used in Urdu and Hindi, often in a derogatory sense, to designate foreigners.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">When ordinary people began joining the revolt, the targets of attack widened. In major towns like Lucknow, Kanpur and Bareilly, moneylenders and the rich also became the objects of rebel wrath. Peasants not only saw them as oppressors but also as allies of the British. In most places their houses were looted and destroyed. The mutiny in the sepoy ranks quickly became a rebellion. There was a general defiance of all kinds of authority and hierarchy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">In the months of May and June, the British had no answer to the actions of the rebels. Individual Britons tried to save their own lives and the lives of their families. British rule, as one British officer noted, “collapsed like a house made of cards”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">What happened in the cities during the months of the revolt? How did people live through those months of tumult? How was normal life affected? Reports from different cities tell us about the breakdown in routine activities. Read these reports from the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Delhi Urdu Akhbar,</span><span class="font50"> 14 June 1857:</span></p>

Remember that newspaper reports often express the prejudices of the reporter. How did </span><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">Delhi Urdu Akhbar</span><span class="font30"> view the actions of the people?</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>1.2 Lines of communication</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The reason for the similarity in the pattern of the revolt in different places lay partly in its planning and coordination. It is clear that there was communication between the sepoy lines of various cantonments. After the 7th Awadh Irregular Cavalry had refused to accept the new cartridges in early May, they wrote to the 48th Native Infantry that “they had acted for the faith and awaited the 48th’s orders”. Sepoys or their emissaries moved from one station to another. People were thus planning and talking about the rebellion.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Sisten and the </span><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tahsildar</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">In the context of the communication of the message of revolt and mutiny, the experience of Frangois Sisten, a native Christian police inspector in Sitapur, is telling. He had gone to Saharanpur to pay his respects to the magistrate. Sisten was dressed in Indian clothes and sitting cross-legged. A Muslim </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">tahsildar</span><span class="font50"> from Bijnor entered the room; upon learning that Sisten was from Awadh, he enquired, “What news from Awadh? How does the work progress, brother?” Playing safe, Sisten replied, “If we have work in Awadh, your highness will know it.” The </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">tahsildar</span><span class="font50"> said, “Depend upon it, we will succeed this time. The direction of the business is in able hands.” The </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">tahsildar</span><span class="font50"> was later identified as the principal rebel leader of Bijnor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The pattern of the mutinies and the pieces of evidence that suggest some sort of planning and coordination raise certain crucial questions. How were the plans made? Who were the planners? It is difficult on the basis of the available documents to provide direct answers to such questions. But one incident provides clues as to how the mutinies came to be so organised. Captain Hearsey of the Awadh Military Police had been given protection by his Indian subordinates during the mutiny. The 41st Native Infantry, which was stationed in the same place, insisted that since they had killed all their white officers, the Military Police should also kill Hearsey or deliver him as prisoner to the 41st. The Military Police refused to do either, and it was decided that the matter would be settled by a panchayat composed of native officers drawn from each regiment. Charles Ball, who wrote one of the earliest histories of the uprising, noted that panchayats were a nightly occurrence in the Kanpur sepoy lines. What this suggests is that some of the decisions were taken collectively. Given the fact that the sepoys lived in lines and shared a common lifestyle and that many of them came from the same caste, it is not difficult to imagine them sitting together to decide their own future. The sepoys were the makers of their own rebellion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">In the context of the revolt of 1857 the term revolt refers primarily to the uprising of the civilian population (peasants, zamindars, rajas, </span><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">Jagirdars) </span><span class="font30">while the mutiny was of the sepoys.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>1.3 Leaders and followers</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">To fight the British, leadership and organisation were required. For these the rebels sometimes turned to those who had been leaders before the British conquest. One of the first acts of the sepoys of Meerut, as we saw, was to rush to Delhi and appeal to the old Mughal emperor to accept the leadership of the revolt. This acceptance of leadership took its time in coming. Bahadur Shah’s first reaction was one of horror and rejection. It was only when some sepoys had moved into the Mughal court within the Red Fort, in defiance of normal court etiquette, that the old emperor, realising he had very few options, agreed to be the nominal leader of the rebellion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Elsewhere, similar scenes were enacted though on a minor scale. In Kanpur, the sepoys and the people of the town gave Nana Sahib, the successor to Peshwa Baji Rao II, no choice save to join the revolt as their leader. In Jhansi, the rani was forced by the popular pressure around her to assume the leadership of the uprising. So was Kunwar Singh, a local zamindar in Arrah in Bihar. In Awadh, where the displacement of the popular Nawab Wajid Ali Shah and the annexation of the state were still very fresh in the memory of the people, the populace in Lucknow celebrated the fall of British rule by hailing Birjis Qadr, the young son of the Nawab, as their leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Not everywhere were the leaders people of the court - ranis, rajas, nawabs and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars. </span><span class="font30">Often the message of rebellion was carried by ordinary men and women and in places by religious men too. From Meerut, there were reports that a fakir had appeared riding on an elephant and that the sepoys were visiting him frequently. In Lucknow, after the annexation of Awadh, there were many religious leaders and self-styled prophets who preached the destruction of British rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Elsewhere, local leaders emerged, urging peasants, zamindars and tribals to revolt. Shah Mal mobilised the villagers of pargana Barout in Uttar Pradesh; Gonoo, a tribal cultivator of Singhbhum in Chotanagpur, became a rebel leader of the Koi tribals of the region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">l\vo rebels of 1857</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Shah Mal</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Shah Mal lived in a large village in pargana Barout in Uttar Pradesh. He belonged to a clan of Jat cultivators whose kinship ties extended over </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">chaurasee des </span><span class="font50">(eighty-four villages). The lands in the region were irrigated and fertile, with rich dark loam soil. Many of the villagers were prosperous and saw the British land revenue system as oppressive: the revenue demand was high and its collection inflexible. Consequently cultivators were losing land to outsiders, to traders and moneylenders who were coming into the area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Shah Mal mobilised the headmen and cultivators of </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">chaurasee des,</span><span class="font50"> moving at night from village to village, urging people to rebel against the British. As in many other places, the revolt against the British turned into a general rebellion against all signs of oppression and injustice. Cultivators left their fields and plundered the houses of moneylenders and traders. Displaced proprietors took possession of the lands they had lost. Shah Mal’s men attacked government buildings, destroyed the bridge over the river, and dug up metalled roads - partly to prevent government forces from coming into the area, and partly because bridges and roads were seen as symbols of British rule. They sent supplies to the sepoys who had mutinied in Delhi and stopped all official communication between British headquarters and Meerut. Locally acknowledged as the Raja, Shah Mal took over the bungalow of an English officer, turned it into a “hall of justice”, settling disputes and dispensing judgments. He also set up an amazingly effective network of intelligence. For a period the people of the area felt that </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">firangi raj</span><span class="font50"> was over, and their </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">raj</span><span class="font50"> had come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Shah Mal was killed in battle in July 1857.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah was one of the many </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">maulvis</span><span class="font50"> who played an important part in the revolt of 1857. Educated in Hyderabad, he became a preacher when young. In 1856, he was seen moving from village to village preaching </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">jehad</span><span class="font50"> (religious war) against the British and urging people to rebel. He moved in a palanquin, with drumbeaters in front and followers at the rear. He was therefore popularly called Danka Shah - the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">maulvi</span><span class="font50"> with the drum </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">(danka).</span><span class="font50"> British officials panicked as thousands began following the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">maulvi</span><span class="font50"> and many Muslims began seeing him as an inspired prophet. When he reached Lucknow in 1856, he was stopped by the police from preaching in the city. Subsequently, in 1857, he was jailed in Faizabad. When released, he was elected by the mutinous 22<sup>nd</sup> Native Infantry as their leader. He fought in the famous Battle of Chinhat in which the British forces under Henry Lawrence were defeated. He came to be known for his courage and power. Many people in fact believed that he was invincible, had magical powers, and could not be killed by the British. It was this belief that partly formed the basis of his authority.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>1.4 Rumours and prophecies</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Rumours and prophecies played a part in moving people to action. As we saw, the sepoys who had arrived in Delhi from Meerut had told Bahadur Shah about bullets coated with the fat of cows and pigs and that biting those bullets would corrupt their caste and religion. They were referring to the cartridges of the Enfield rifles which had just been given to them. The British tried to explain to the sepoys that this was not the case but the rumour that the new cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs spread like wildfire across the sepoy lines of North India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This is one rumour whose origin can be traced. Captain Wright, commandant of the Rifle Instruction Depot, reported that in the third week of January 1857 a “low-caste” </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">khalasi</span><span class="font30"> who worked in the magazine in Dum Dum had asked a Brahmin sepoy for a drink of water from his </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">lota.</span><span class="font30"> The sepoy had refused saying that the “lower caste’s” touch would defile the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">lota.</span><span class="font30"> The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">khalasi</span><span class="font30"> had reportedly retorted, “You will soon lose your caste, as ere long you will have to bite cartridges covered with the fat of cows and pigs.” We do not know the veracity of the report, but once this rumour started no amount of assurances from British officers could stop its circulation and the fear it spread among the sepoys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">This was not the only rumour that was circulating in North India at the beginning of 1857. There was the rumour that the British government had hatched a gigantic conspiracy to destroy the caste and religion of Hindus and Muslims. To this end, the rumours said, the British had mixed the bone dust of cows and pigs into the flour that was sold in the market. In towns and cantonments, sepoys and the common people refused to touch the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">atta.</span><span class="font30"> There was fear and suspicion that the British wanted to convert Indians to Christianity. Panic spread fast. British officers tried to allay their fears, but in vain. These fears stirred men to action. The response to the call for action was reinforced by the prophecy that British rule would come to an end on the centenary of the Battle of Plassey, on 23 June 1857.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Rumours were not the only thing circulating at the time. Reports came from various parts of North India that chapattis were being distributed from village to village. A person would come at night and give a chapatti to the watchman of the village and ask him to make five more and distribute to the next village, and so on. The meaning and purpose of the distribution of the chapattis was not clear and is not clear even today. But there is no doubt that people read it as an omen of an upheaval.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>1.5 Why did people believe in the rumours?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">We cannot understand the power of rumours and prophecies in history by checking whether they are factually correct or not. We need to see what they reflect about the minds of people who believed them - their fears and apprehensions, their faiths and convictions. Rumours circulate only when they resonate with the deeper fears and suspicions of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The rumours in 1857 begin to make sense when seen in the context of the policies the British pursued from the late 1820s. As you know, from that time, under the leadership of Governor General Lord William Bentinck, the British adopted policies aimed at “reforming” Indian society by introducing Western education, Western ideas and Western institutions. With the cooperation of sections of Indian society they set up English-medium schools, colleges and universities which taught Western sciences and the liberal arts. The British established laws to abolish customs like sati (1829) and to permit the remarriage of Hindu widows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">On a variety of pleas, like misgovernment and the refusal to recognise adoption, the British annexed not only Awadh, but many other kingdoms and principalities like Jhansi and Satara. Once these territories were annexed, the British introduced their own system of administration, their own laws and their own methods of land settlement and land revenue collection. The cumulative impact of all this on the people of North India was profound.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">It seemed to the people that all that they cherished and held sacred - from kings and socio-religious customs to patterns of landholding and revenue payment - was being destroyed and replaced by a system that was more impersonal, alien and oppressive. This perception was aggravated by the activities of Christian missionaries. In such a situation of uncertainty, rumours spread with remarkable swiftness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">In 1851 Governor General Lord Dalhousie described the kingdom of Awadh as “a cherry that will drop into our mouth one day”. Five years later, in 1856, the kingdom was formally annexed to the British Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The conquest happened in stages. The Subsidiary Alliance had been imposed on Awadh in 1801. By the terms of this alliance the Nawab had to disband his military force, allow the British to position their troops within the kingdom, and act in accordance with the advice of the British Resident who was now to be attached to the court. Deprived of his armed forces, the Nawab became increasingly dependent on the British to maintain law and order within the kingdom. He could no longer assert control over the rebellious chiefs and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the meantime the British became increasingly interested in acquiring the territory of Awadh. They felt that the soil there was good for producing indigo and cotton, and the region was ideally located to be developed into the principal market of Upper India. By the early 1850s, moreover, all the major areas of India had been conquered: the Maratha lands, the Doab, the Carnatic, the Punjab and Bengal. The takeover of Awadh in 1856 was expected to complete a process of territorial annexation that had begun with the conquest of Bengal almost a century earlier.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Lord Dalhousie’s annexations created disaffection in all the areas and principalities that were annexed but nowhere more so than in the kingdom of Awadh in the heart of North India. Here, Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was dethroned and exiled to Calcutta on the plea that the region was being misgoverned. The British government also wrongly assumed that Wajid Ali Shah was an unpopular ruler. On the contrary, he was widely loved, and when he left his beloved Lucknow, there were many who followed him all the way to Kanpur singing songs of lament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The widespread sense of grief and loss at the Nawab’s exile was recorded by many contemporary observers. One of them wrote: ‘The life was gone out of the body, and the body of this town had been left lifeless ... there was no street or market and house</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">and issues, traditions and loyalties worked themselves out in the revolt of 1857. In Awadh, more than anywhere else, the revolt became an expression of popular resistance to an alien order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The annexation displaced not just the Nawab. It also dispossessed the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> of the region. The countryside of Awadh was dotted with the estates and forts of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> who for many generations had controlled land and power in the countryside. Before the coming of the British, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> maintained armed retainers, built forts, and enjoyed a degree of autonomy, as long as they accepted the suzerainty of the Nawab and paid the revenue of their </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqs.</span><span class="font30"> Some of the bigger </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> had as many as 12,000 footsoldiers and even the smaller ones had about 200. The British were unwilling to tolerate the power of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars.</span><span class="font30"> Immediately after the annexation, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> were disarmed and their forts destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The British land revenue policy further undermined the position and authority of the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars.</span><span class="font30"> After annexation, the first British revenue settlement, known as the Summary Settlement of 1856, was based on the assumption that the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> were interlopers with no permanent stakes in land: they had established their hold over land through force and fraud. The Summary Settlement proceeded to remove the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> wherever possible. Figures show that in pre-British times, </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> had held 67 per cent of the total number of villages in Awadh; by the Summary Settlement this number had come down to 38 per cent. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> of southern Awadh were the hardest hit and some lost more than half of the total number of villages they had previously held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">British land revenue officers believed that by removing </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> they would be able to settle the land with the actual owners of the soil and thus reduce the level of exploitation of peasants while increasing revenue returns for the state. But this did not happen in practice: revenue flows for the state increased but the burden of demand on the peasants did not decline. Officials soon found that large areas of Awadh were actually heavily overassessed: the increase of revenue demand in some places was from 30 to 70 per cent. Thus neither </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> nor peasants had any reasons to be happy with the annexation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The dispossession of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> meant the breakdown of an entire social order. The ties of loyalty and patronage that had bound the peasant to the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdar</span><span class="font30"> were disrupted. In pre-British times, the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> were oppressors but many of them also appeared to be generous father figures: they exacted a variety of dues from the peasant but were often considerate in times of need. Now, under the British, the peasant was directly exposed to overassessment of revenue and inflexible methods of collection. There was no longer any guarantee that in times of hardship or crop failure the revenue demand of the state would be reduced or collection postponed; or that in times of festivities the peasant would get the loan and support that the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdar</span><span class="font30"> had earlier provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In areas like Awadh where resistance during 1857 was intense and long lasting, the fighting was carried out by </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> and their peasants. Many of these </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font30"> were loyal to the Nawab of Awadh, and they joined Begum Hazrat Mahal (the wife of the Nawab) in Lucknow to fight the British; some even remained with her in defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The grievances of the peasants were carried over into the sepoy lines since a vast majority of the sepoys were recruited from the villages of Awadh. For decades the sepoys had complained of low levels of pay and the difficulty of getting leave. By the 1850s there were other reasons for their discontent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The relationship of the sepoys with their superior white officers underwent a significant change in the years preceding the uprising of 1857. In the 1820s, white officers made it a point to maintain friendly relations with the sepoys. They would take part in their leisure activities - they wrestled with them, fenced with them and went out hawking with them. Many of them were fluent in Hindustani and were familiar with the customs and culture of the country. These officers were disciplinarian and father figure rolled into one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the 1840s, this began to change. The officers developed a sense of superiority and started treating the sepoys as their racial inferiors, riding roughshod over their sensibilities. Abuse and physical violence became common and thus the distance between sepoys and officers grew. Trust was replaced by suspicion. The episode of the greased cartridges was a classic example of this.</span></p>

<p><span class="font50">The attitude of the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">taluqdars</span><span class="font50"> was best expressed by Hanwant Singh, the Raja of Kalakankar, near Rae Bareli. During the mutiny, Hanwant Singh had given shelter to a British officer, and conveyed him to safety. While taking leave of the officer, Hanwant Singh told him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Sahib, your countrymen came into this country and drove out our King. You sent your officers round the districts to examine the titles to the estates. At one blow you took from me lands which from time immemorial had been in my family. I submitted. Suddenly misfortune fell upon you. The people of the land rose against you.

<p><span class="font30">It is also important to remember that close links existed between the sepoys and the rural world of North India. The large majority of the sepoys of the Bengal Army were recruited from the villages of Awadh and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Many of them were Brahmins or from the “upper” castes. Awadh was, in fact, called the “nursery of the Bengal Army”. The changes that the families of</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">the sepoys saw around them and the threats they perceived were quickly transmitted to the sepoy lines. In turn, the fears of the sepoys about the new cartridge, their grievances about leave, their grouse about the increasing misbehaviour and racial abuse on the part of their white officers were communicated back to the</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">villages. This link between the sepoys and the rural world had important implications in the course of the uprising. When the sepoys defied their superior officers and took up arms they were joined very swiftly by their brethren in the villages. Everywhere, peasants poured into towns and joined the soldiers and the ordinary people of the towns in collective acts of rebellion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">As victors, the British recorded their own trials and tribulations as well as their heroism. They dismissed the rebels as a bunch of ungrateful and barbaric people. The repression of the rebels also meant silencing of their voice. Few rebels had the opportunity of recording their version of events. Moreover, most of them were sepoys and ordinary people who were not literate. Thus, other than a few proclamations and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ishtahars</span><span class="font30"> (notifications) issued by rebel leaders to propagate their ideas and persuade people to join the revolt, we do not have much that throws light on the perspective of the rebels. Attempts to reconstruct what happened in 1857 are thus heavily and inevitably dependent on what the British wrote. While these sources reveal the minds of officials, they tell us very little about what the rebels wanted.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>3.1 The vision of unity</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">The rebel proclamations in 1857 repeatedly appealed to all sections of the population, irrespective of their caste and creed. Many of the proclamations were issued by Muslim princes or in their names but even these took care to address the sentiments of Hindus. The rebellion was seen as a war in which both Hindus and Muslims had equally to lose or gain. The </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ish.tah.ars</span><span class="font30"> harked back to the pre-British Hindu-Muslim past and glorified the coexistence of different communities under the Mughal Empire. The proclamation that was issued under the name of Bahadur Shah appealed to the people to join the fight under the standards of both Muhammad and Mahavir. It was remarkable that during the uprising religious divisions between Hindus and Muslim were hardly noticeable despite British attempts to create such divisions. In Bareilly in western Uttar Pradesh, in December 1857, the British spent Rs 50,000 to incite the Hindu population against the Muslims. The attempt failed.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Azamgarh Proclamation, 25 August 1857</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This is one of the main sources of our knowledge about what the rebels wanted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">It is well known to all, that in this age the people of Hindostan, both Hindoos and Mohammedans, are being ruined under the tyranny and the oppression of the infidel and treacherous English. It is therefore the bounden duty of all the wealthy people of India, especially those who have any sort of connection with the Mohammedan royal families, and are considered the pastors and masters of their people, to stake their lives and property for the well-being of the public. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Several of the Hindoo and Mussalman Chiefs, who have long since quitted their homes for the preservation of their religion, and have been trying their best to root out the English in India, have presented themselves to me, and taken part in the reigning Indian crusade, and it is more than probable that I shall very shortly receive succours from the West. Therefore for the information of the public, the present </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Ishtahar,</span><span class="font50"> consisting of several sections, is put in circulation and it is the imperative duty of all to take into their careful consideration, and abide by it. Parties anxious to participate in the common cause, but having no means to provide for themselves, shall receive their daily subsistence from me; and be it known to all, that the ancient works, both of the Hindoos and Mohammedans, the writings of miracle workers, and the calculation of the astrologers, pundits, ... all agree in asserting that the English will no longer have any footing in India or elsewhere. Therefore it is incumbent on all to give up the hope of the continuation of the British sway, side with me, and deserve the consideration of the Badshahi, or imperial government, by their individual exertion in</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">contd </span><span class="font50">promoting the common good, and thus attain their respective ends; otherwise if this golden opportunity slips away, they will have to repent for their folly, ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Section I - Regarding Zemindars.</span><span class="font50"> It is evident, that the British Government in making zemindary settlements have imposed exorbitant </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Juntas</span><span class="font50"> (revenue demand) and have disgraced and ruined several zemindars, by putting up their estates for public auction for arrears of rent, in so much, in the institution of a suit by a common Ryot, a maid servant, or a slave, the respectable zemindars are summoned into court, arrested, put in goal and disgraced. In litigation regarding zemindaries, the immense value of stamps, and other unnecessary expenses of the civil courts, ... are all calculated to impoverish the litigants. Besides this, the coffers of the zemindars are annually taxed with the subscription for schools, hospitals, roads, etc. Such extortions will have no manner of existence in the Badshahi Government; but on the contrary the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Juntas</span><span class="font50"> will be light, the dignity and honour of the zemindars safe, and every zemindar will have absolute rule in his own zemindary ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Section II - Regarding Merchants.</span><span class="font50"> It is plain that the infidel and treacherous British Government have monopolised the trade of all the fine and valuable merchandise, such as indigo, cloth, and other articles of shipping, leaving only the trade of trifles to the people, ... Besides this, the profits of the traders are taxed, with postages, tolls and subscriptions for schools, etc. Notwithstanding all these concessions, the merchants are liable to imprisonment and disgrace at the instance or complaint of a worthless man. When the Badshahi Government is established all these aforesaid fraudulent practices shall be dispensed with, and the trade of every article, without exception, both by land and water will be opened to the native merchants of India, ... It is therefore the duty of every merchant to take part in the war, and aid the Badshahi Government with his men and money, ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Section III - Regarding Public Servants.</span><span class="font50"> It is not a secret thing, that under the British Government, natives employed in the civil and military services have little respect, low pay, and no manner of influence; and all the posts of dignity and emolument in both the departments are exclusively bestowed on Englishmen, ... Therefore, all the natives in the British service ought to be alive to their religion and interest, and abjuring their loyalty to the English, side with the Badshahi Government, and obtain salaries of 200 and 300 rupees a month for the present, and be entitled to high posts in the future. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Section IV-</span><span class="font50"> Regarding Artisans. It is evident that the Europeans, by the introduction of English articles into India, have thrown the weavers, the cotton dressers, the carpenters, the blacksmiths, and the shoemakers, etc., out of employ, and have engrossed their occupations, so that every description of native artisan has been reduced to beggary. But under the Badshahi Government the native artisans will exclusively be employed in the service of the kings, the rajahs, and the rich; and this will no doubt ensure their prosperity. Therefore these artisans ought to renounce the English services.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">Section V-</span><span class="font50"> Regarding Pundits, Fakirs and Other Learned Persons. The pundits and fakirs being the guardians of the Hindoo and Mohammadan religions respectively, and the Europeans being the enemies of both the religions, and as at present a war is raging against the English on account of religion, the pundits and fakirs are bound to present themselves to me, and take their share in the holy war... .</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>What the sepoys thought</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">This is one of the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">arzis</span><span class="font50"> (petition or application) of rebel sepoys that have survived: A century ago the British arrived in Hindostan and gradually entertained troops in their service, and became masters of every state. Our forefathers have always served them, and we also entered their service ... By the mercy of God and with our assistance the British also conquered every place they liked, in which thousands of us, Hindostani men were sacrificed, but we never made any excuses or pretences nor revolted ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">But in the year eighteen fifty seven the British issued an order that new cartridges and muskets which had arrived from England were to be issued; in the former of which the fats of cows and pigs were mixed; and also that </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">attah</span><span class="font50"> of wheat mixed with powdered bones was to be eaten; and even distributed them in every Regiment of infantry, cavalry and artillery ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">They gave these cartridges to the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">sowars</span><span class="font50"> (mounted soldiers) of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Light Cavalry, and ordered them to bite them; the troopers objected to it, and said that they would never bite them, for if they did, their religion and faith would be destroyed ... upon this the British officers paraded the men of the 3 Regiments and having prepared 1,400 English soldiers, and other Battalions of European troops and Horse Artillery, surrounded them, and placing six guns before each of the infantry regiments, loaded the guns with grape and made 84 new troopers prisoners, and put them in jail with irons on them ... The reason that the </span><span class="font50" style="font-style:italic;">sowars</span><span class="font50"> of the Cantonment were put into jail was that we should be frightened into biting the new cartridges. On this account we and all our country-men having united together, have fought the British for the preservation of our faith ... we have been compelled to make war for two years and the Rajahs and Chiefs who are with us in faith and religion, are still so, and have undergone all sorts of trouble; we have fought for two years in order that our faith and religion may not be polluted. If the religion of a Hindoo or Mussalman is lost, what remains in the world?</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">The proclamations completely rejected everything associated with British rule or </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">firangi raj</span><span class="font30"> as they called it. They condemned the British for the annexations they had carried out and the treaties they had broken. The British, the rebel leaders said, could not be trusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">What enraged the people was how British land revenue settlements had dispossessed landholders, both big and small, and foreign commerce had driven artisans and weavers to ruin. Every aspect of British rule was attacked and the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">firangi</span><span class="font30"> accused of destroying a way of life that was familiar and cherished. The rebels wanted to restore that world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The proclamations expressed the widespread fear that the British were bent on destroying the caste and religions of Hindus and Muslims and converting them to Christianity - a fear that led people to believe many of the rumours that circulated at the time. People were urged to come together and fight to save their livelihood, their faith, their honour, their identity - a fight which was for the “greater public good”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As noted earlier, in many places the rebellion against the British widened into an attack on all those who were seen as allies of the British or local oppressors. Often the rebels deliberately sought to humiliate the elites of a city. In the villages they burnt account books and ransacked moneylenders’ houses. This reflected an attempt to overturn traditional hierarchies, rebel against </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font30"> oppressors. It presents a glimpse of an alternative vision, perhaps of a more egalitarian society. Such visions were not articulated in the proclamations which sought to unify all social groups in the fight against </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">firangi raj.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>3.3 The search for alternative power</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Once British rule had collapsed, the rebels in places like Delhi, Lucknow and Kanpur tried to establish some kind of structure of authority and administration. This was, of course, short-lived but the attempts show that the rebel leadership wanted to restore the pre-British world of the eighteenth century. The leaders went back to the culture of the court. Appointments were made to various posts, arrangements made for the collection of land revenue and the payment of troops, orders issued to stop loot and plunder. Side by side plans were made to fight battles against the British. Chains of command were laid down in the army. In all this the rebels harked back to the eighteenth-century Mughal world - a world that became a symbol of all that had been lost.</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font31">O Discuss...</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">What do you think are the major problems faced by historians in reconstructing the point of view of the rebels?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The administrative structures established by the rebels were primarily aimed at meeting the demands of war. However, in most cases these structures could not survive the British onslaught. But in Awadh, where resistance to the British lasted longest, plans of counter-attack were being drawn up by the Lucknow court and hierarchies of command were in place as late as the last months of 1857 and the early part of 1858.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>4.</span><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"> Repression</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">It is clear from all accounts that we have of 1857 that the British did not have an easy time in putting down the rebellion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Before sending out troops to reconquer North India, the British passed a series of laws to help them quell the insurgency. By a number of Acts, passed in May and June 1857, not only was the whole of North India put under martial law but military officers and even ordinary Britons were given the power to try and punish Indians suspected of rebellion. In other words, the ordinary processes of law and trial were suspended and it was put out that rebellion would have only one punishment - death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Armed with these newly enacted special laws and the reinforcements brought in from Britain, the British began the task of suppressing the revolt. They, like the rebels, recognised the symbolic value of Delhi. The British thus mounted a two-pronged attack. One force moved from Calcutta into North India and the other from the Punjab - which was largely peaceful - to reconquer Delhi. British</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">attempts to recover Delhi began in earnest in early June 1857 but it was only in late September that the city was finally captured. The fighting and losses on both sides were heavy. One reason for this was the fact that rebels from all over North India had come to Delhi to defend the capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the Ganegtic plain too the progress of British reconquest was slow. The forces had to reconquer the area village by village. The countryside and the people around were entirely hostile. As soon as they began their counter-insurgency operations, the British realised that they were not dealing with a mere mutiny but an uprising that had huge popular support. In Awadh, for example, a British official called Forsyth estimated that three-fourths of the adult male population was in rebellion. The area was brought under control only in March 1858 after protracted fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The British used military power on a gigantic scale. But this was not the only instrument they used. In large parts of present-day Uttar Pradesh, where big landholders and peasants had offered united resistance, the British tried to break up the unity by promising to give back to the big landholders their estates. Rebel landholders were dispossessed and the loyal rewarded. Many landholders died fighting the British or they escaped into Nepal where they died of illness or starvation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">How do we know about the revolt, about the activities of the rebels and the measures of repression that we have been discussing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As we have seen, we have very few records on the rebels’ point of view. There are a few rebel proclamations and notifications, as also some letters that rebel leaders wrote. But historians till now have continued to discuss rebel actions primarily through accounts written by the British.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Official accounts, of course, abound: colonial administrators and military men left their versions in letters and diaries, autobiographies and official histories. We can also gauge the official mindset and the changing British attitudes through the innumerable memos and notes, assessments of situations, and reports that were produced. Many of these have now been collected in a set of volumes on mutiny records. These tell us about the fears and anxieties of officials and their perception of the rebels. The stories of the revolt that were published in British newspapers and magazines narrated in gory detail the violence of the mutineers - and these stories inflamed public feelings and provoked demands of retribution and revenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">One important record of the mutiny is the pictorial images produced by the British and Indians: paintings, pencil drawings, etchings, posters, cartoons, bazaar prints. Let us look at some of them and see what they tell us.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>5.1 Celebrating the saviours</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">British pictures offer a variety of images that were meant to provoke a range of different emotions and reactions. Some of them commemorate the British heroes who saved the English and repressed the rebels. “Relief of Lucknow”, painted by Thomas Jones Barker in 1859, is an example of this type. When the rebel forces besieged Lucknow, Henry Lawrence, the Commissioner of Lucknow, collected the Christian population and took refuge in the heavily fortified Residency. Lawrence was killed but the Residency continued to be defended under the command of Colonel Inglis. On 25 September James Outram and Henry Havelock arrived, cut through the rebel forces, and reinforced the British garrisons. Twenty days later Colin Campbell, who</span></p>

<p><span class="font29" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas Jones Barker, 1859</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">was appointed as the new Commander of British forces in India, came with his forces and rescued the besieged British garrison. In British accounts the siege of Lucknow became a story of survival, heroic resistance and the ultimate triumph of British power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Barker’s painting celebrates the moment of Campbell’s entry. At the centre of the canvas are the British heroes - Campbell, Outram and Havelock. The gestures of the hands of those around lead the spectator’s eyes towards the centre. The heroes stand on a ground that is well lit, with shadows in the foreground and the damaged Residency in the background. The dead and injured in the foreground are testimony to the suffering during the siege, while the triumphant figures of horses in the middle ground emphasise the fact that British power and control had been re-established. To the British public such paintings were reassuring. They created a sense that the time of trouble was past and the rebellion was over; the British were the victors.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>5.2 English women and the honour of Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Newspaper reports have a power over public imagination; they shape feelings and attitudes to events. Inflamed particularly by tales of violence against women and children, there were public demands in Britain for revenge and retribution. The British government was asked to protect the honour of innocent women and ensure the safety of helpless children. Artists expressed as well as shaped these sentiments through their visual representations of trauma and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">“In Memoriam” (Fig. 11.11) was painted by Joseph Noel Paton two years after the mutiny. You can see English women and children huddled in a circle, looking helpless and innocent, seemingly waiting for the inevitable - dishonour, violence and death. “In Memoriam” does not show gory violence; it only suggests it. It stirs up the spectator’s imagination, and seeks to provoke anger and fury. It represents the rebels as violent and brutish, even though they remain invisible in the picture. In the background you can see the British rescue forces arriving as saviours.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">In another set of sketches and paintings we see women in a different light. They appear heroic, defending themselves against the attack of rebels. Miss Wheeler in Figure 11.12 stands firmly at the centre, defending her honour, single-handedly killing the attacking rebels. As in all such British representations, the rebels are demonised. Here, four burly males with swords and guns are shown attacking a woman. The woman’s struggle to save her honour and her life, in fact, is represented as having a deeper religious connotation: it is a battle to save the honour of Christianity. The book lying on the floor is the Bible.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>5.3 Vengeance and retribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As waves of anger and shock spread in Britain, demands for retribution grew louder. Visual representations and news about the revolt created a milieu in which violent repression and vengeance were seen as both necessary and just. It was as if justice demanded that the challenge to British honour and power be met ruthlessly. Threatened by the rebellion, the British felt that they had to demonstrate their invincibility. In one such image (Fig. 11.13) we see an allegorical female figure of justice with a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. Her posture is aggressive; her face expresses rage and the desire for revenge. She is trampling sepoys under her feet while a mass of Indian women with children cower with fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">There were innumerable other pictures and cartoons in the British press that sanctioned brutal repression and violent reprisal.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>5.6 Nationalist imageries</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The national movement in the twentieth century drew its inspiration from the events of 1857. A whole world of nationalist imagination was woven around the revolt. It was celebrated as the First War of Independence in which all sections of the people of India came together to fight against imperial rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Art and literature, as much as the writing of history, have helped in keeping alive the memory of 1857. The leaders of the revolt were presented as heroic figures leading the country into battle, rousing the people to righteous indignation against oppressive imperial rule. Heroic poems were written about the valour of the queen who, with a sword in one hand and the reins of her horse in the other, fought for the freedom of her motherland. Rani of Jhansi was represented as a masculine figure chasing the enemy, slaying British soldiers and valiantly fighting till her last. Children in many parts of India grow up reading the lines of Subhadra Kumari Chauhan: </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">“Khoob lari mardani woh to Jhansi wali rani thi”</span><span class="font30"> (Like a man she fought, she was the Rani of Jhansi). In popular prints Rani Lakshmi Bai is usually portrayed in battle armour, with a sword in hand and riding a horse - a symbol of the determination to resist injustice and alien rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The images indicate how the painters who produced them perceived those events, what they felt, and what they sought to convey. Through the paintings and cartoons we know about the public that looked at the paintings, appreciated or criticised the images, and bought copies and reproductions to put up in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">These images did not only reflect the emotions and feelings of the times in which they were produced. They also shaped sensibilities. Fed by the images that circulated in Britain, the public sanctioned the most brutal forms of repression of the rebels. On the other hand, nationalist imageries of the revolt helped shape the nationalist imagination.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">In this chapter we will discuss the process of urbanisation in colonial India, explore the distinguishing characteristics of colonial cities and track social changes within them. We will look closely at developments in three big cities - Madras (Chennai), Calcutta (Kolkata) and Bombay (Mumbai).</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">All three were originally fishing and weaving villages. They became important centres of trade due to the economic activities of the English East India Company. Company agents settled in Madras in 1639 and in Calcutta in 1690. Bombay was given to the Company in 1661 by the English king, who had got it as part of his wife’s dowry from the king of Portugal. The Company established trading and administrative offices in each of these settlements.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">By the middle of the nineteenth century these settlements had become big cities from where the new rulers controlled the country. Institutions were set up to regulate economic activity and demonstrate the authority of the new rulers. Indians experienced political domination in new ways in these cities. The layouts of Madras, Bombay and Calcutta were quite different from older Indian towns, and the buildings that were built in these cities bore the marks of their colonial origin. What do buildings express and what can architecture convey? This is a question that students of history need to ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Remember that architecture helps in giving ideas a shape in stone, brick, wood or plaster. From the bungalow of the government officer, the palatial house of the rich merchant to the humble hut of the labourer, buildings reflect social relations and identities in many ways.</span></p>

<p><span class="font53" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Before we explore the growth of cities in the colonial period, let us look at urban centres during the centuries preceding British rule.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>1.1 What gave towns their character?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">Towns were often defined in opposition to rural areas. They came to represent specific forms of economic activities and cultures. In the countryside people subsisted by cultivating land, foraging in the forest, or rearing animals. Towns by contrast were peopled with artisans, traders, administrators and rulers. Towns dominated over the rural population, thriving on the surplus and taxes derived from agriculture. Towns and cities were often fortified by walls which symbolised their separation from the countryside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">However, the separation between town and country was fluid. Peasants travelled long distances on pilgrimage, passing through towns; they also flocked to towns during times of famine. Besides, there was a reverse flow of humans and goods from towns to villages. When towns were attacked, people often sought shelter in the countryside. Traders and pedlars took goods from the towns to sell in the villages, extending markets and creating new patterns of consumption.</span></p>

<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font50">This is how the famous poet Mirza Ghalib described what the people of Delhi did when the British forces occupied the city in 1857:</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">Smiting the enemy and driving him before them, the victors (i.e., the British) overran the city in all directions. All whom they found in the street they cut down ... For two to three days every road in the city, from the Kashmiri Gate to Chandni Chowk, was a battlefield. Three gates - the Ajmeri, the Turcoman and the Delhi - were still held by the rebels ... At the naked spectacle of this vengeful wrath and malevolent hatred the colour fled from men’s faces, and a vast concourse of men and women ... took to precipitate flight through these three gates. Seeking the little villages and shrines outside the city, they drew breath to wait until such time as might favour their return.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the towns built by the Mughals were famous for their concentration of populations, their monumental buildings and their imperial grandeur and wealth. Agra, Delhi and Lahore were important centres of imperial administration and control. </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">Mansabdars</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">jagirdars</span><span class="font30"> who were assigned territories in different parts of the empire usually maintained houses in these cities: residence in these centres of power was symbolic of the status and prestige of a noble.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The presence of the emperor and noblemen in these centres meant that a wide variety of services had to be provided. Artisans produced exclusive handicrafts for the households of nobles. Grain from the countryside was brought into urban markets for the town dwellers and the army. The treasury was also located in the imperial capital. Thus the revenues of the kingdom flowed into the capital regularly. The emperor lived in a fortified palace and the town was enclosed by a wall, with entry and exit being regulated by different gates. Within these towns were gardens, mosques, temples, tombs, colleges, bazaars and caravanserais. The focus of the town was oriented towards the palace and the principal mosque.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the towns of South India such as Madurai and Kanchipuram the principal focus was the temple. These towns were also important commercial centres. Religious festivals often coincided with fairs, linking pilgrimage with trade. Generally, the ruler was the highest authority and the principal patron of religious institutions. The relationship that he had with other groups and classes determined their place in society and in the town.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Medieval towns were places where everybody was expected to know their position in the social order dominated by the ruling elite.

<p><span class="font30">All this started changing in the eighteenth century. With political and commercial realignments, old towns went into decline and new towns developed. The gradual erosion of Mughal power led to the demise of towns associated with their rule. The Mughal capitals, Delhi and Agra, lost their political authority. The growth of new regional powers was reflected in the increasing importance of regional capitals - Lucknow, Hyderabad, Seringapatam, Poona (present-day Pune), Nagpur, Baroda (presentday Vadodara) and Tanjore (present-day Thanjavur). Traders, administrators, artisans and others migrated from the old Mughal centres to these new capitals in search of work and patronage. Continuous warfare between the new kingdoms meant that mercenaries too found ready employment there. Some local notables and officials associated with Mughal rule in North India also used this opportunity to create new urban settlements such as the </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">qasbah</span><span class="font30"> and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ganj.</span><span class="font30"> However, the effects of political decentralisation were uneven. In some places there was renewed economic activity, in other places war, plunder and political uncertainty led to economic decline.</span></p>

They provided for noble families and the army.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">Changes in the networks of trade were reflected in the history of urban centres. The European commercial Companies had set up base in different places early during the Mughal era: the Portuguese in Panaji in 1510, the Dutch in Masulipatnam in 1605, the British in Madras in 1639 and the French in Pondicherry (present-day Puducherry) in 1673. With the expansion of commercial activity, towns grew around these trading centres. By the end of the eighteenth century the land-based empires in Asia were replaced by the powerful</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">From the mid-eighteenth century, there was a new phase of change. Commercial centres such as Surat, Masulipatnam and Dhaka, which had grown in the seventeenth century, declined when trade shifted to other places. As the British gradually acquired political control after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and the trade of the English East India Company expanded, colonial port cities such as Madras, Calcutta and Bombay rapidly emerged as the new economic capitals. They also became centres of colonial administration and political power. New buildings and institutions developed, and urban spaces were ordered in new ways. New occupations developed and people flocked to these colonial cities. By about 1800, they were the biggest cities in India in terms of population.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Colonial rule was based on the production of enormous amounts of data. The British kept detailed records of their trading activities in order to regulate their commercial affairs. To keep track of life in the growing cities, they carried out regular surveys, gathered statistical data, and published various official reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">From the early years, the colonial government was keen on mapping. It felt that good maps were necessary to understand the landscape and know the topography. This knowledge would allow better control over the region. When towns began to grow, maps were prepared not only to plan the development of these towns but also to develop commerce and consolidate power. The town maps give information regarding the location of hills, rivers and vegetation, all important for planning structures for defence purposes. They also show the location of </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ghats,</span><span class="font30"> density and quality of houses and alignment of roads, used to gauge commercial possibilities and plan strategies of taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">From the late nineteenth century the British tried to raise money for administering towns through the systematic annual collection of municipal taxes. To avoid conflict they handed over some responsibilities to elected Indian representatives. Institutions like the municipal corporation with some popular</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">representation were meant to administer essential services such as water supply, sewerage, road building and public health. The activities of municipal corporations in turn generated a whole new set of records maintained in municipal record rooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The growth of cities was monitored through regular headcounts. By the mid-nineteenth century several local censuses had been carried out in different regions. The first all-India census was attempted in 1872. Thereafter, from 1881, decennial (conducted every ten years) censuses became a regular feature. This collection of data is an invaluable source for studying urbanisation in India.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">When we look at these reports it appears that we have hard data to measure historical change. The endless pages of tables on disease and death, or the enumeration of people according their age, sex, caste and occupation, provide a vast mass of figures that creates an illusion of concreteness. Historians have, however, found that the figures can be misleading. Before we use these figures we need to understand who collected the data, and why and how they were gathered. We also need to know what was measured and what was not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The census operation, for instance, was a means by which social data were converted into convenient statistics about the population. But this process was riddled with ambiguity. The census commissioners devised categories for classifying different sections of the population. This classification was often arbitrary and failed to capture the fluid and overlapping identities of people. How was a person who was both an artisan and a trader to be classified? How was a person who cultivated his land and carted produce to the town to be enumerated? Was he a cultivator or a trader?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Often people themselves refused to cooperate or gave evasive answers to the census officials.</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">What maps reveal and conceal</span></p>
<p><span class="font50">The development of survey methods, accurate scientific instruments and British imperial needs meant that maps were prepared with great care. The Survey of India was established in 1878. While the maps that were prepared give us a lot of information, they also reflect the bias of the British rulers. Large settlements of the poor in towns went unmarked on maps because they seemed unimportant to the rulers. As a result it was assumed that these blank spaces on the map were available for other development schemes. When these schemes were undertaken, the poor were evicted.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">For a long while they were suspicious of census operations and believed that enquiries were being conducted to impose new taxes. Upper-caste people were also unwilling to give any information regarding the women of their household: women were supposed to remain secluded within the interior of the household and not subjected to public gaze or public enquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Census officials also found that people were claiming identities that they associated with higher status. For instance there were people in towns who were hawkers and went selling small articles during some seasons, while in other seasons they earned their livelihood through manual labour. Such people often told the census enumerators that they were traders, not labourers, for they regarded trade as a more respectable activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Similarly, the figures of mortality and disease were difficult to collect, for all deaths were not registered, and illness was not always reported, nor treated by licensed doctors. How then could cases of illness or death be accurately calculated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Thus historians have to use sources like the census with great caution, keeping in mind their possible biases, recalculating figures and understanding what the figures do not tell. However, census, survey maps and records of institutions like the municipality help us to study colonial cities in greater detail than is possible for pre-colonial cities.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>2.2 Trends of change</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">A careful study of censuses reveals some fascinating trends. After 1800, urbanisation in India was sluggish. All through the nineteenth century up to the first two decades of the twentieth, the proportion of the urban population to the total population in India was extremely low and had remained stagnant. This is clear from Figure 12.5. In the forty years between 1900 and 1940 the urban population increased from about 10 per cent of the total population to about 13 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Beneath this picture of changelessness, there were significant variations in the patterns of urban development in different regions. The smaller towns had little opportunity to grow economically. Calcutta, Bombay and Madras on the other hand grew rapidly and soon became sprawling cities. In other</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">words, the growth of these three cities as the new commercial and administrative centres was at the expense of other existing urban centres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">As the hub of the colonial economy, they functioned as collection depots for the export of Indian manufactures such as cotton textiles in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. After the Industrial Revolution in England, this trend was reversed and these cities instead became the entry point for British-manufactured goods and for the export of Indian raw materials. The nature of this economic activity sharply differentiated these colonial cities from India’s traditional towns and urban settlements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The introduction of railways in 1853 meant a change in the fortunes of towns. Economic activity gradually shifted away from traditional towns which were located along old routes and rivers. Every railway station became a collection depot for raw materials and a distribution point for imported goods. For instance, Mirzapur on the Ganges, which specialised in collecting cotton and cotton goods from the Deccan, declined when a railway link was made to Bombay (see Chapter 10, Figs. 10.18 and 10.19). With the expansion of the railway network, railway workshops and railway colonies were established. Railway towns like Jamalpur, Waitair and Bareilly developed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">By the eighteenth century Madras, Calcutta and Bombay had become important ports. The settlements that came up here were convenient points for collecting goods.

<p><span class="font30">Madras, Fort St George, in Calcutta Fort William and in Bombay the Fort marked out the areas of British settlement. Indian merchants, artisans and other workers who had economic dealings with European merchants lived outside these forts in settlements of their own. Thus, from the beginning there were separate quarters for Europeans and Indians, which came to be labelled in contemporary writings as the “White Town” and “Black Town” respectively. Once the British captured political power these racial distinctions became sharper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">From the mid-nineteenth century the expanding network of railways linked these cities to the rest of the country. As a result the hinterland - the countryside from where raw materials and labour were drawn - became more closely linked to these port cities. Since raw material was transported to these cities for export and there was plentiful cheap labour available, it was convenient to set up modern factories there. After the 1850s, cotton mills were set up by Indian merchants and entrepreneurs in Bombay, and European-owned jute mills were established on the outskirts of Calcutta. This was the beginning of modern industrial development in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Although Calcutta, Bombay and Madras supplied raw materials for industry in England, and had emerged because of modern economic forces like capitalism, their economies were not primarily based on factory production. The majority of the working population in these cities belonged to what economists classify as the tertiary sector. There were only two</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">proper “industrial cities”: Kanpur, specialising in leather, woollen and cotton textiles, and Jamshedpur, specialising in steel. India never became a modern industrialised country, since discriminatory colonial policies limited the levels of industrial development. Calcutta, Bombay and Madras grew into large cities, but this did not signify any dramatic economic growth for colonial India as a whole.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">Colonial cities reflected the mercantile culture of the new rulers. Political power and patronage shifted from Indian rulers to the merchants of the East India Company. Indians who worked as interpreters, middlemen, traders and suppliers of goods also had an important place in these new cities. Economic activity near the river or the sea led to the development of docks and </span><span class="font30" style="font-style:italic;">ghats.</span><span class="font30"> Along the shore were godowns, mercantile offices, insurance agencies for shipping, transport depots, banking establishments.

<p><span class="font30">The rich Indian agents and middlemen built large traditional courtyard houses in the Black Town in the vicinity of the bazaars. They bought up large tracts of land in the city as future investment. To impress their English masters they threw lavish parties during festivals. They also built temples to establish their status in society. The labouring poor provided a variety of services to their European and Indian masters as cooks, palanquin bearers, coachmen, guards, porters and construction and dock workers. They lived in makeshift huts in different parts of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">The nature of the colonial city changed further in the mid-nineteenth century. After the Revolt of 1857 British attitudes in India were shaped by a constant fear of rebellion. They felt that towns needed to be better defended, and white people had to live in more secure and segregated enclaves, away from the threat of the “natives”. Pasturelands and agricultural fields around the older towns were cleared, and new urban spaces called “Civil Lines” were set up. White people began to live in the Civil Lines. Cantonments-places where Indian troops under European command were stationed - were also developed as safe enclaves. These areas were separate from but attached to the Indian towns. With broad streets, bungalows set amidst large gardens, barracks, parade ground and church, they were meant as a</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">safe haven for Europeans as well as a model of ordered urban life in contrast to the densely built-up Indian towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">For the British, the “Black” areas came to symbolise not only chaos and anarchy, but also filth and disease. For a long while the British were interested primarily in the cleanliness and hygiene of the “White” areas. But as epidemics of cholera and plague spread, killing thousands, colonial officials felt the need for more stringent measures of sanitation and public health. They feared that disease would spread from the “Black” to the “White” areas. From the 1860s and 1870s, stringent administrative measures regarding sanitation were implemented and building activity in the Indian towns was regulated. Underground piped water supply and sewerage and drainage systems were also put in place around this time. Sanitary vigilance thus became another way of regulating Indian towns.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>3.3 The first hill stations</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font30">As in the case of cantonments, hill stations were a distinctive feature of colonial urban development. The founding and settling of hill stations was initially connected with the needs of the British army. Simla (present-day Shimla) was founded during the course of the Gurkha War (1815-16); the Anglo-Maratha War of 1818 led to British interest in Mount Abu; and Darjeeling was wrested from the rulers of Sikkim in 1835. Hill stations became strategic places for billeting troops, guarding frontiers and launching campaigns against enemy rulers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29">While the British Introduced colonial architectural styles In the hill stations, the local population often continued to live as before.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The temperate and cool climate of the Indian hills was seen as an advantage, particularly since the British associated hot weather with epidemics. Cholera and malaria were particularly feared and attempts were made to protect the army from these diseases. The overwhelming presence of the army made these stations a new kind of cantonment in the hills. These hill stations were also developed as sanitariums, i.e., places where soldiers could be sent for rest and recovery from illnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Because the hill stations approximated the cold climates of Europe, they became an attractive destination for the new rulers. It became a practice for viceroys to move to hill stations during the summer months. In 1864 the Viceroy John Lawrence officially moved his council to Simla, setting seal to the practice of shifting capitals during the hot season. Simla also became the official residence of the commander-in-chief of the Indian army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">In the hill stations the British and other Europeans sought to recreate settlements that were reminiscent of home. The buildings were deliberately built in the European style. Individual houses followed the pattern of detached villas and cottages set amidst gardens.The Anglican Church and educational institutions represented British ideals. Even recreation activities came to be shaped by British cultural traditions. Thus social calls, teas, picnics, fetes, races and visits to the theatre became common among colonial officials in the hill stations.</span></p>
<div><img src="index-310.jpg" alt="" style="width:264pt;height:182pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font30">The introduction of the railways made hill stations more accessible to a wide range of people including Indians. Upper-and middle-class Indians such as maharajas, lawyers and merchants were drawn to these stations because they afforded them a close proximity to the ruling British elite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">Hill stations were important for the colonial economy. With the setting up of tea and coffee plantations in the adjoining areas, an influx of immigrant labour from the plains began. This meant that hill stations no longer remained exclusive racial enclaves for Europeans in India.</span></p>
