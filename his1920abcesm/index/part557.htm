Soon, they became a familiar sight, picketing outside liquor shops, opium dens and shops selling foreign cloth. For Indian women, the movement was the most liberating experience and can truly be said to have marked their entry into the public sphere.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Students <span class="p">Along with women, students and youth played the most prominent part in the boycott of foreign cloth and liquor.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Muslims <span class="p">The Muslim participation was nowhere near the 1920-22 level because of appeals by Muslim leaders to stay away from the movement and because of active government encouragement to communal dissension. Still, some areas such as the NWFP saw an overwhelming participation. Middle class Muslim participation was quite significant in Senhatta, Tripura, Gaibandha, Bagura and Noakhali. In Dacca, Muslim leaders, shopkeepers, lower class people and upper class women were active. The Muslim</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">weaving community in Bihar, Delhi and Lucknow were also effectively  mobilised.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Merchants and Petty Traders <span class="p">They were very enthusiastic. Traders’ associations and commercial bodies were active in implementing the boycott, especially in Tamil Nadu and Punjab.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Tribals <span class="p">Tribals were active participants in Central Provinces, Maharashtra and Karnataka.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Workers <span class="p">The workers participated in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Sholapur, etc.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Peasants <span class="p">were active in the United Provinces, Bihar and Gujarat.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Government Response—Efforts for Truce <span class="p">The government’s attitude throughout 1930 was ambivalent as it was puzzled and perplexed. It faced the classic dilemma of ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’, if force was applied, the Congress cried ‘repression’, and if little action taken, the Congress cried ‘victory’. Either way, the government suffered an erosion of power. Even Gandhi’s arrest came after much vacillation. But once the repression began, the ordinances banning civil liberties were freely used, including the press being gagged. Provincial governments were given freedom to ban civil disobedience organisations. The Congress Working Committee was, however, not declared illegal till June. There were lathi charges and firing on unarmed crowds which left several killed and wounded, while thousands of satyagrahis besides Gandhi and other Congress leaders were imprisoned.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The government repression and publication of the Simon Commission Report, which contained no mention of dominion status and was in other ways also a regressive document, further upset even moderate political opinion.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In <b>July 1930 </b>the viceroy, Lord Irwin, suggested a round table conference and reiterated the goal of dominion status. He also accepted the suggestion that Tej Bahadur Sapru and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">M.R. Jayakar be allowed to explore the possibility of peace between the Congress and the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In <b>August 1930 </b>Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru were taken to Yeravada Jail to meet Gandhi and discuss the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">possibility of a settlement. The Nehrus and Gandhi unequivocally reiterated the demands of:</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">1. right of secession from Britain;</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">2. complete national government with control over defence and finance; and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">3. an independent tribunal to settle Britain’s financial claims.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Talks broke down at this point.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part556.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part558.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
