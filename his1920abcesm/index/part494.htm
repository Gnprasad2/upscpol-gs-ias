Both sides also</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">realised the significance of putting up a united front to get a mass movement to force the government to introduce reforms, and both sides accepted the necessity of Gandhi’s leadership of a united nationalist front. Keeping these factors in mind, a compromise was reached at a meeting in Delhi in September 1923.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Swarajists were allowed to contest elections as a group within the Congress. The Swarajists accepted the Congress programme with only one difference—that they would join legislative councils. The elections to the newly constituted Central Legislative Assembly and to provincial assemblies were to be held in November 1923.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Swarajist Manifesto for Elections <span class="p">Released in October 1923, the Swarajist manifesto took a strong anti-imperialist line.
