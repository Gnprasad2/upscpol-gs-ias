Or, in other words, what was the potential of these upsurges?</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">These upsurges were in the nature of direct and violent conflict with authority, which had obvious limitations. Only the more militant sections could participate.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">These upsurges were short-lived and were confined to a few urban centres while the general INA agitation reached the remotest villages.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Communal unity witnessed was more organisational than a unity among the people. Muslim ratings went to the League to seek advice and the rest to the Congress and the Socialists.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Despite considerable erosion of the morale of the bureaucracy, the British infrastructure to repress was intact. They were soon able to control the situation. It was a Maratha battalion in Bombay that rounded up the ratings and restored them to their barracks.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part671.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part673.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
