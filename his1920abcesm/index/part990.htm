Bhutto was reported to be in favour of beginning a new relationship with India. India was not against the idea. Bhutto was invited for a summit at Simla in June 1972. At the meeting, the Indians expressed the need for a comprehensive treaty settling all outstanding problems including Kashmir. But the Pakistanis preferred a step by step approach. In the end, whereas the Indian side wanted a ‘no- war pact’, it had to agree to a ‘renunciation of force’ by both sides. The Kashmir issue was left hanging, and regarding the Line of Control which India wanted to be respected by both sides Pakistan added the caveat, ‘without prejudice to the recognised position of either side’. Many of India’s demands were watered down, and India apparently went with it because it realised the precarious position held by Bhutto in Pakistan and pushing too hard may have deposed him and made the situation worse. The agreement (not treaty, as India wanted) was signed on July 2.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Simla Agreement was considered to be a comprehensive blue print for good neighbourly relations between India and Pakistan. Under the agreement both countries undertook to abjure conflict and confrontation, and to work towards the establishment of durable peace, friendship and cooperation.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The two countries agreed to follow a set of guiding principles in managing relations with each other: respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty; non- interference in each other’s internal affairs; respect for each other’s unity, political independence; sovereign equality; and abjuring hostile propaganda.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">There was a mutual commitment  to  the  peaceful resolution  of  all  issues  through  direct  bilateral  approaches, and to build the foundations of a cooperative relationship with special focus on people to people contacts.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part989.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part991.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
