He made a clear distinction between the democratic nations of western Europe and the totalitarian Nazis and fascists. He said that he was not willing to embarrass the British government during the war.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Subhas Bose and other socialists<span class="p">, such as Acharya Narendra Dev and Jayaprakash Narayan, who had been invited by the Congress to attend the Wardha meeting so that different opinions could be discussed, had no sympathy for either side in the war. In their opinion, the war was being fought by imperialists on both sides; each side wanted to protect its colonial possessions and gain more territories to colonise, so neither side should be supported by the nationalists. In fact, they thought it was the ideal time to launch a civil disobedience movement, to thus take advantage of the situation and snatch freedom from Britain.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Jawaharlal Nehru <span class="p">was not ready to accept the opinion of either Gandhi or of the socialists. He was clear in his mind about the difference between democratic values and fascism.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">He believed that justice was on the side of Britain, France and Poland, but he also believed that Britain and France were imperialist powers, and that “the war was the result of the inner contradictions of capitalism maturing since the end of World War I”. He, therefore, advocated no Indian participation till India itself was free. However, at the same time, no advantage was to be taken of Britain’s difficulty by starting an immediate civil disobedience movement.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Gandhi was more or less isolated in his stand. In the end he decided to go with Nehru’s position, which was adopted by the Congress Working Committee.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The CWC resolution <span class="p">condemned Fascist aggression. It said that (i) India could not be party to a war being fought, on the face of it, for democratic freedom, while that freedom was being denied to India; (ii) if Britain was fighting for democracy and freedom, it should be proved by ending imperialism in its colonies and establishing full democracy in India; (iii) the government should declare its war aims soon</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">and, also, as to how the principles of democracy were to be applied to India after the war.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Congress leadership wanted “to give every chance to the viceroy and the British Government”.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part621.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part623.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
