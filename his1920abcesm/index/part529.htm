When the Simon Commission was announced, the Congress, which did not have any active programme in hand, got an issue on which it could once again forge mass action.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(ii) The challenge of Lord Birkenhead to Indian politicians to produce an agreed constitution was accepted by various political sections, and thus prospects for Indian unity seemed bright at that point of time.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Simon Commission Recommendations <span class="p">The Simon Commission published a two-volume report in May 1930. It proposed the abolition of dyarchy and the establishment of representative government in the provinces which should be given autonomy. It said that the governor should have discretionary power in relation to internal security and administrative powers to protect the different communities. The number of members of provincial legislative council should be increased.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The report rejected parliamentary responsibility at the centre. The governor-general was to have complete power to appoint the members of the cabinet. And the Government of India would have complete control over the high court.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">It also recommended that separate communal electorates be retained (and extended such electorates to other communities) but only until tensions between Hindus and Muslims had died down. There was to be no universal franchise.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">It accepted the idea of federalism but not in the near future; it suggested that a Consultative Council of Greater India should be established which should include representatives of both the British provinces as well as princely states.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">It suggested that the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan should get local legislatures, and both NWFP and Baluchistan should have the right to be represented at the centre.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">It recommended that Sindh should be separated from Bombay, and Burma should be separated from India because it was not a natural part of the Indian subcontinent.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">It also suggested that the Indian army should be Indianised though British forces must be retained. India got fully equipped.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">But by the time the report came out, it was no longer relevant because several events overtook the importance of its recommendations.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part528.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part530.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
