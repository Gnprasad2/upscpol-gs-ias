Between 1907 and 1911, five new laws were brought into force to check anti-government activity. These legislations</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">View</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">”…the mischief of the trial and condemnation of Tilak would be greater than if you left him alone”.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—<b>John Morley</b>, Secretary of State for India in a letter to Sydenham, Governor of Bombay</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">included the Seditious Meetings Act, 1907; Indian Newspapers (Incitement to Offences) Act, 1908; Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908; and the Indian Press Act, 1910. Tilak, the main Extremist leader, was tried in 1909 for sedition for what he had written in 1908 in his <i>Kesari </i>about a bomb thrown by Bengal revolutionaries in Muzaffarpur, resulting in the death of two innocent European women.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Tilak had written: “This, no doubt, will inspire many with hatred against the people belonging to the party of rebels. It is not possible to cause British rule to disappear from this country by such monstrous deeds. But rulers who exercise unrestricted power must always remember that there is also a limit to the patience of humanity … many newspapers had warned the government that if they resorted to Russian methods, then Indians too will be compelled to imitate the Russian methods”.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In another article, Tilak wrote that the real means of stopping the bombs consisted in making a beginning towards the grant of rights of ‘Swarajya’ to the people. Tilak was judged guilty and sentenced to six years’ transportation and a fine of Rs 1,000. He was sent to Mandalay (Burma) jail for six years. Aurobindo and B.C. Pal retired from active politics. Lajpat Rai left for abroad. The Extremists were not able to organise an effective alternative party to sustain the movement. The Moderates were left with no popular base or support, especially as the youth rallied behind the Extremists.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">After 1908, the national movement as a whole declined for a time. In 1914, Tilak was released and he picked up the threads of the movement.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part407.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part409.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
