This open sympathy, inside and outside Indian Parliament, was disliked by the Sri Lankan government. But the Indian government, considering the ethnic disputes in Sri Lanka to be an internal matter of that country, remained friendly towards Sri Lanka. Both nations forged mutually beneficient economic and trade relations. In fact, Sri Lanka supported NAM and did not join any military alliance.</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Chapter 39</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">After Nehru. . .</p><p style="padding-top: 17pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Towards the last years of Nehru’s prime ministership itself, there were serious debates on what would happen to India after him. And when he died in May 1964, many in India and abroad were almost sure that the Indian political system would be severely and adversely affected, could even collapse, with a fight within the Congress party over who would take charge. However, there was no such turmoil; a smooth succession took place. Indeed, since the Nehruvian era, India has seen not only several prime ministers but also certain changes in its political history. Down the years there have been some upheavals to threaten the smooth functioning of a vibrant democracy, but these challenges have been met and overcome. Amidst the coups and military takeovers in the neighbouring countries, India has managed to survive as a democracy and witness smooth change of government from time to time though democratic elections.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Immediately after Nehru’s death, Gulzarilal Nanda was appointed as the interim prime minister, pending the election of a new parliamentary leader of the Congress party who would then become prime minister.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part940.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part942.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
