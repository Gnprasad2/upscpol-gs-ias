Rajagopalachari organised a march from Thiruchirapalli (Trichinapoly as it was called by the British) to Vedaranniyam on the Tanjore (or Thanjavur) coast to break the salt law. The event was followed by widespread picketing of foreign cloth shops; the anti-liquor campaign gathered forceful support in interior regions of Coimbatore, Madura, Virdhanagar, etc. Although, Rajaji tried to keep the movement non-violent, violent eruptions of masses and the violent repressions of the police began. To break the Choolai mills strike, police force was used. Unemployed weavers attacked liquor shops and police pickets at Gudiyattam, while the peasants, suffering from falling prices, rioted at Bodinayakanur in Madura.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s16">● </span><b>Malabar </b>K. Kelappan, a Nair Congress leader famed for the <i>Vaikom Satyagraha</i>, organised salt marches. P. Krishna Pillai, the future founder of the Kerala Communist movement, heroically defended the national flag in the face of police lathi-charge on Calicut beach in November 1930.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s16">● </span><b>Andhra Region </b>District salt marches were organised in east and west Godavari, Krishna and Guntur. A number of <i>sibirams </i>(military style camps) were set up to serve as the headquarters of the Salt Satyagraha. The merchants contributed to Congress funds, and the dominant caste Kamma and Raju cultivators defied repressive measures. But the mass support like that in the non-cooperation movement (1921-22) was missing in the region.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="s5">Orissa </span><span class="p">Under Gopalbandhu Chaudhuri, a Gandhian leader, salt satyagraha proved effective in the coastal regions of Balasore, Cuttack and Puri districts.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="s5">Assam </span><span class="p">The civil disobedience failed to regain the heights attained in 1921-22 due to divisive issues: the growing conflicts  between Assamese and  Bengalis, Hindus and Muslims, and the tensions developing from the inflow of Muslim peasants from the densely populated east Bengal. However, a successful student strike against the Cunningham Circular, which banned students’ participation in politics, was seen in May 1930. Chandraprabha Saikiani, in December 1930, incited the aboriginal Kachari villages to break forest laws, which was, however, denied by the Assam Congress leadership.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s16">● </span><b>Bengal </b>The Bengal Congress, divided into two factions led by Subhas Bose and J.M. Sengupta, was involved in the Calcutta Corporation election. This resulted in alienation of most of Calcutta <i>bhadralok </i>leaders from the rural masses. Also, communal riots were seen in Dacca (now Dhakha) and Kishoreganj, and there was little participation of Muslims in the movements. Despite this, Bengal provided the largest number of arrests as well as the highest amount of violence. Midnapur, Arambagh and several rural pockets witnessed powerful movements developed around salt satyagraha and chaukidari tax. During the same period, Surya Sen’s Chittagong revolt group carried out a raid on two armouries and declared the establishment of a provisional government.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s16">● </span><b>Bihar </b>Champaran and Saran were the first two districts to start salt satyagraha<i>. </i>In landlocked Bihar, manufacture of salt on a large scale was not practicable and at most places it was a mere gesture. In Patna, Nakhas Pond was chosen as a site to make salt and break the salt law under Ambika Kant Sinha. However, very soon, a very powerful no- chaukidari tax agitation replaced the salt satyagraha (owing to physical constraints in making salt). By November 1930, sale of foreign cloth and liquor dramatically declined, and administration collapsed in several parts like the Barhee region of Munger.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The tribal belt of Chhotanagpur (now in Jharkhand), saw instances of lower-class militancy. Bonga Majhi and Somra Majhi, influenced by Gandhism, led a movement in Hazaribagh which combined socio-religious reform along ‘sanskritising’</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">lines, in which followers were asked to give up meat and liquor, and use khadi. However, the Santhals were reported to be taking up illegal distillation of liquor on a large scale under the banner of Gandhi! It was observed that while most big zamindars remained loyal to the government, small landlords and better-off tenants participated in the movement. But several times, increased lower-class-militancy lowered the enthusiasm of the small landlords and better-off tenants.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><b>Peshawar </b>Here, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan’s educational and social reform work among the Pathans had politicised them. Gaffar Khan, also called <b>Badshah Khan </b>and <b>Frontier Gandhi</b>, had started the first Pushto political monthly <i>Pukhtoon </i>and had organised a volunteer brigade ‘Khudai Khidmatgars’, popularly known as the ‘Red-Shirts’, who were pledged to the freedom struggle and non-violence.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">On April 23, 1930, the arrest of Congress leaders in the  NWFP  led  to  mass  demonstrations  in  Peshawar  which was virtually in the hands of the crowds for more than a week till order was restored on May 4. This was followed by a reign of terror and martial law. It was here that a section of Garhwal Rifles soldiers refused to fire on an unarmed crowd. This upsurge in a province with 92 per cent Muslim population left the British government nervous.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Sholapur <span class="p">This industrial town of southern Maharashtra</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">saw the fiercest response to Gandhi’s arrest. Textile workers went on a strike from May 7 and along with other residents burnt liquor shops and other symbols of government authority such as railway stations, police stations, municipal buildings, law courts, etc. The activists established a virtual parallel government which could only be dislodged with martial law after May 16.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Dharasana <span class="p">On May 21, 1930, Sarojini Naidu, Imam Sahib and Manilal (Gandhi’s son) took up the unfinished task of leading a raid on the Dharasana Salt Works. The unarmed and peaceful crowd was met with a brutal lathicharge which left 2 dead and 320 injured. This new form of salt satyagraha was eagerly adopted by people in Wadala (Bombay), Karnataka (Sanikatta  Salt  Works),  Andhra,  Midnapore,  Balasore,  Puri and Cuttack.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Gujarat <span class="p">The impact was felt in Anand, Borsad and Nadiad areas in Kheda district, Bardoli in Surat district and Jambusar in Bharuch district. A determined no-tax movement was organised here which included refusal to pay land revenue. Villagers crossed the border into neighbouring princely states (such as Baroda) with their families and belongings and camped in the open for months to evade police repression. The police retaliated by destroying their property and confiscating their land.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Maharashtra, Karnataka, Central Provinces <span class="p">These areas saw defiance of forest laws such as grazing and timber restrictions and public sale of illegally acquired forest produce.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">United Provinces <span class="p">A no-revenue campaign was organised; a call was given to zamindars to refuse to pay revenue to the government. Under a no-rent campaign, a call was given to tenants against zamindars. Since most of the zamindars were loyalists, the campaign became virtually a no- rent campaign. The activity picked up speed in October 1930, especially in Agra and Rai Bareilly.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Manipur and Nagaland <span class="p">These areas took a brave part in the movement. At the young age of thirteen, </span>Rani Gaidinliu<span class="p">, a Naga spiritual leader, who followed her cousin Haipou Jadonang, born in what is now the state of Manipur, raised the banner of revolt against foreign rule. “We are free people, the white men should not rule over us,” she declared. She urged the people not to pay taxes or work for the British—in the tradition established by the freedom struggle</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Views</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Gandhiji’s body is in jail but his soul is with you. India’s prestige is now in your hands. You must not use any violence under any circumstances. You will be beaten but you must not resist, you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">—<b>Sarojini Naidu</b>, <i>on the eve of Dharasana</i></p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Salt Sahyagraha</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Although everyone knew that within a few minutes he would be beaten down, and perhaps killed, I could detect no signs of wavering or fear. They marched steadily with heads up….</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">—<b>Web Miller</b>, <i>an American journalist, reporting</i></p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">on Dharasana Salt Satyagraha</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">in the rest of India. As the reformist religious movement steadily turned political, the British authorities caught Haipou Jadonang and hanged him on charges of treason in 1931. A manhunt was launched for Rani Gaidinliu. She outwitted the British till October 1932 when she was finally captured. She was later sentenced to life imprisonment. [It was the Interim Government of India set up in 1946 that finally ordered her release from Tura jail.]</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part553.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part555.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
