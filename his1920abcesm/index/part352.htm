Although limited in its objectives, the Landholders’ Society marked the beginning of an organised political activity and use of methods of constitutional agitation for the redressal of grievances.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Bengal British India Society <span class="p">was founded in 1843 with the object of “the collection and dissemination of information relating to the actual condition of the people of British India... and to employ such other means of peaceful and lawful character as may appear calculated to secure the welfare, extend the just rights and advance the interests of all classes of our fellow subjects”.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In 1851, both the Landholders’ Society and the Bengal British India Society merged into the <b>British Indian Association</b>. It sent a petition to the British Parliament demanding inclusion of some of its suggestions in the renewed Charter of the Company, such as</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) establishment of a separate legislature of a popular character;</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(ii) separation of executive from judicial functions;</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(iii) reduction in salaries of higher officers; and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(iv) abolition of salt duty, abkari and stamp duties. These were partially accepted when the Charter Act of</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">1853 provided for the addition of six members to the governor-general’s council for legislative purposes.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The East India Association <span class="p">was organised by Dadabhai Naoroji in 1866 in London to discuss the Indian question and influence public men in England to promote Indian welfare. Later, branches of the association were started in prominent Indian cities.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Indian League <span class="p">was started in 1875 by Sisir Kumar Ghosh with the object of “stimulating the sense of nationalism amongst the people” and of encouraging political education.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Indian Association of Calcutta <span class="p">(also known as the </span>Indian National Association<span class="p">) superseded the Indian League and was founded in 1876 by younger nationalists of Bengal led by Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose, who were getting discontented with the conservative and pro-landlord policies of the British Indian Association. The Indian Association was the most important of pre- Congress associations and aimed to “promote by every legitimate means the political, intellectual and material advancement of the people.” It set out to—</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) create a strong public opinion on political questions, and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(ii) unify Indian people in a common political programme.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">It protested against the reduction of age limit in 1877 for candidates of the Indian Civil Service examination. The association demanded simultaneous holding of civil service examination in England and India and Indianisation of higher administrative posts. It led a campaign against the repressive arms act and the vernacular press act.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Branches of the association were opened in other towns and cities of Bengal and even outside Bengal. The membership fee was kept low in order to attract the poorer sections to the association.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The association sponsored an all India conference which first took place in Calcutta on December 28 to 30, 1883. More than hundred delegates from different parts of the country attended. So, in a way the association was a forerunner of the Indian National Congress as an all-India nationalist organisation. It later merged with the Indian National Congress in 1886.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part351.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part353.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
