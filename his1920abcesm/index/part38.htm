In fact, Hooghly was used by some Portuguese as a base for piracy in the Bay of Bengal. The decline of the Portuguese was brought about by several factors. The local advantages gained by the Portuguese in India were reduced with the emergence of powerful dynasties in Egypt, Persia and North India and the rise of the turbulent Marathas as their immediate neighbours. (The Marathas captured Salsette and Bassein in 1739 from the Portuguese.)</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The religious policies of the Portuguese, such as the activities of the Jesuits, gave rise to political fears. Their antagonism for the Muslims apart, the Portuguese policy of conversion to Christianity made Hindus also resentful.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Their dishonest trade practices also evoked a strong reaction. The Portuguese earned notoriety as sea pirates. Their arrogance and violence brought them the animosity of the rulers of small states and the imperial Mughals as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The discovery of Brazil diverted colonising activities of Portugal to the West.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The union of the two kingdoms of Spain and Portugal in 1580-81, dragging the smaller kingdom into Spain’s wars</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">View</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The Portuguese entered India with the sword in one hand and the crucifix in the other; finding much gold, they laid aside the crucifix to fill their pockets, and not being able to hold them up with one hand, they were grown so heavy, they dropped the sword, too; being found in this posture by those who came after, they were easily overcome.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 146pt;text-indent:  39pt;text-align: justify;">—<b>Alfonso de Souza</b>, the Portuguese Governor in India (1542-45)</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">with England and Holland, badly affected Portuguese monopoly of trade in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The earlier monopoly of knowledge of the sea route to India held by the Portuguese could not remain a secret forever; soon enough the Dutch and the English, who were learning the skills of ocean navigation, also learnt of it. As new trading communities from Europe arrived in India, there began a fierce rivalry among them. In this struggle, the Portuguese had to give way to the more powerful and enterprising competitors. The Dutch and the English had greater resources and more compulsions to expand overseas, and they overcame the Portuguese resistance.

Goa which remained with the Portuguese had lost its importance as a port after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire and soon it did not matter in whose possession it was. The spice trade came under the control of the Dutch, and Goa was superseded by Brazil as the economic centre of the overseas empire of Portugal. In 1683, after two naval assaults, the Marathas invaded Goa.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part37.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part39.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
