But,  above  all,  these tendencies contributed, at least to some extent, in compartmentalising Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Parsis, as also alienating high caste Hindus from low caste Hindus.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The emphasis on religious and philosophical aspects of the cultural heritage got somewhat magnified by an insufficient emphasis on other aspects of culture—art, architecture, literature, music, science and technology. To make matters worse, the Hindu reformers confined their praise of the Indian past to its ancient period and looked upon the medieval period of Indian history essentially as an era of decadence. This tended to create a notion of two separate peoples, on the one hand; on the other, an uncritical praise of the past was not acceptable to the low caste sections of society which had suffered under religiously sanctioned exploitation during the ancient period. Moreover, the past itself tended to be placed into compartments on a partisan basis. Many in the Muslim middle classes went to the extent of turning to the history of West Asia for their traditions and moments of pride.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The process of evolution of a composite culture which was evident throughout Indian history showed signs of being arrested with the rise of another form of consciousness— communal consciousness—along with national consciousness among the middle classes.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Many other factors were certainly responsible for the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">birth of communalism in modern times, but undoubtedly the nature of religious reform movements also contributed to it.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">On the whole, however, whatever the net outcome of these reform movements, it was out of this struggle that a new society evolved in India.</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part340.htm">Summary</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part338.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part340.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
