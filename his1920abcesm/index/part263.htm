Their accumulated grievances found immediate expression and they rose <i>en masse </i>to give vent to their opposition to British rule. It is the widespread participation in the revolt by the peasantry, the artisans, shopkeepers, day labourers, zamindars, religious mendicants, priests and civil servants which gave it real strength as well as the character of a popular revolt. Here the peasants and petty zamindars gave free expression to their grievances by attacking the money-lenders and zamindars who had displaced them from the land. They took advantage of the revolt to destroy the money-lenders’ account books and debt records. They also attacked the British-established law courts, revenue offices (<i>tehsils</i>), revenue records and police stations.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">According to one estimate, of the total number of about 1,50,000 men who died fighting the English in Awadh, over 1,00,000 were civilians.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Within a month of the capture of Delhi by the rebels, the revolt spread to different parts of the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">Storm Centres and Leaders of the Revolt </span>At Delhi the nominal and symbolic leadership belonged to the Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, but the real command lay with a court of soldiers headed by <b>General Bakht Khan </b>who had led the revolt of Bareilly troops and brought them to Delhi. The court consisted of ten members, six from the army and four from the civilian departments. The court conducted the affairs of the state in the name of the emperor. Emperor <b>Bahadur Shah </b>was perhaps the weakest link in the chain of leadership of the revolt. His weak personality, old age and lack of leadership qualities created political weakness at the nerve centre of the revolt and did incalculable damage to it.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">At Kanpur, the natural choice was <b>Nana Saheb</b>, the adopted son of the last peshwa, Baji Rao II. He was refused the family title and banished from Poona, and was living near Kanpur. Nana Saheb expelled the English from Kanpur, proclaimed himself the peshwa, acknowledged Bahadur Shah as the Emperor of India and declared himself to be his governor. Sir Hugh Wheeler, commanding the station, surrendered on June 27, 1857 and was killed on the same day.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Begum Hazrat Mahal <span class="p">took over the reigns at Lucknow where the rebellion broke out on June 4, 1857 and popular sympathy was overwhelmingly in favour of the deposed nawab. Her son, Birjis Qadir, was proclaimed the nawab and a regular administration was organised with important offices shared equally by Muslims and Hindus. Henry Lawrence, the British resident, the European inhabitants and a few hundred loyal sepoys took shelter in the residency. The residency was besieged by the Indian rebels and Sir Henry was killed during the siege. The command of the besieged garrison devolved on Brigadier Inglis who held out against heavy odds. The early attempts of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">recover Lucknow met with no success. Finally, Sir Colin Campbell, the new commander-in-chief, evacuated the Europeans with the help of Gorkha regiments. In March 1858, the city was finally recovered by the British, but guerrilla activity continued till September of the same year.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">At Bareilly, <b>Khan Bahadur</b>, a descendant of the former ruler of Rohilkhand, was placed in command. Not enthusiastic about the pension being granted by the British, he organised an army of 40,000 soldiers and offered stiff resistance to the British.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">In Bihar, the revolt was led by <b>Kunwar Singh</b>, the zamindar of Jagdishpur. An old man in his seventies, he nursed a grudge against the British who had deprived him of his estates. He unhesitatingly joined the sepoys when they reached Arrah from Dinapore (Danapur).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Maulvi Ahmadullah <span class="p">of Faizabad was another outstanding leader of the revolt. He was a native of Madras and had moved to Faizabad in the north where he fought a stiff battle against the British troops. He emerged as one of the revolt’s acknowledged leaders once it broke out in Awadh in May 1857.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">The most outstanding leader of the revolt was <b>Rani Laxmibai</b>, who assumed the leadership of the sepoys at Jhansi. Lord Dalhousie, the governor-general, had refused to allow her adopted son to succeed to the throne after her husband Raja Gangadhar Rao died, and had annexed the state by the application of the infamous ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. Driven out of Jhansi by British forces, she gave the battle cry—<i>”main apni Jhansi nahin doongi” </i>(I shall not give away my Jhansi). She was joined by <b>Tantia Tope</b>, a close associate of Nana Saheb, after the loss of Kanpur. The Rani of Jhansi and Tantia Tope marched towards Gwalior where they were hailed by the Indian soldiers. The Sindhia, the local ruler, however, decided to side with the English and took</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">View</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Here lay the woman who was the only man among the rebels.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—<b>Hugh Rose</b></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(a tribute to the Rani of Jhansi from the man</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">who defeated her)</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">shelter at Agra. Nana Saheb was proclaimed the Peshwa and plans were chalked out for a march into the south. Gwalior was recaptured by the English in June 1858.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">The sacrifices made by the common masses were immense and innumerable. The name of <b>Shah Mal</b>, a local villager in Pargana Baraut (Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh), is most notable. He organised the headmen and peasants of 84 villages (referred as chaurasi desh), marching at night from village to village, urging people to rebel against the British hegemony. The people attacked government buildings, destroyed the bridges over the rivers and dug up metalled roads—partially to stop government forces from coming into the area, and partly because bridges and roads were viewed as symbols of British rule. Shah Mal sent supplies to the mutineers in Delhi and prevented all official communication between British headquarters and Meerut. He made his headquarters at the bungalow of an irrigation department on the banks of the Yamuna and supervised and controlled his operations from there. In fact, the bungalow was turned into a “hall of justice”, resolving disputes and dispensing judgments. He also organised an effective network of intelligence for a short duration, the people of the area felt that the British rule was over, and their own rule had come. Unfortunately, in July 1857, Shah Mal was killed by an English officer, Dunlap. It is alleged that Shah Mal’s body was cut into pieces and his head displayed on July 21, 1857 to terrify the public. For more than a year, however, the rebels carried on their struggle against heavy odds.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part262.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part264.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
