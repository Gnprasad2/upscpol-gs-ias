Mitra and Prithwishchandra Ray. The methods adopted were petitions to the government, public meetings, memoranda, and propaganda through pamphlets and newspapers such as <i>Hitabadi, Sanjibani </i>and <i>Bengalee</i>. Their objective was to exert sufficient pressure on the government through an educated public opinion in India and England to prevent the unjust partition of Bengal from being implemented.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Ignoring a loud public opinion against the partition proposal, the government announced partition of Bengal in July 1905. Within days, protest meetings were held in small towns all over Bengal. It was in these meetings that the pledge to boycott foreign goods was first taken. <b>On August 7, 1905, with the passage of the Boycott Resolution in a massive meeting held in the Calcutta Townhall, the formal</b></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">proclamation of Swadeshi Movement was made. <span class="p">After this, the leaders dispersed to other parts of Bengal to propagate the message of boycott of Manchester cloth and Liverpool salt.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">October 16, 1905, the day the partition formally came into force, was observed as a day of mourning throughout Bengal. People fasted, bathed in the Ganga and walked barefoot in processions singing <i>Bande Mataram </i>(which almost spontaneously became the theme song of the movement). <i>‘Amar Sonar Bangla</i>’, the national anthem of present-day Bangladesh, was composed by Rabindranath Tagore, and was sung by huge crowds marching in the streets. People tied <i>rakhis </i>on each other’s hands as a symbol of unity of the two halves of Bengal. Later in the day, Surendranath Banerjea and Ananda Mohan Bose addressed huge gatherings (perhaps  the  largest  till  then  under  the  nationalist  banner). Within a few hours of the meeting, Rs 50,000 was raised for the movement.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Soon, the movement spread to other parts of the</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">country—in Poona and Bombay under Tilak, in Punjab under Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh, in Delhi under Syed Haider Raza, and in Madras under Chidambaram Pillai.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part384.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part386.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
