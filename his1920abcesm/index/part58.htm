With less governmental control over it, this company could take instant decisions when needed without waiting for the approval of the government. The French company, on the other hand, was a State concern. It was controlled and regulated by the French government and was hemmed in by government policies and delays in decision-making.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The English navy was superior to the French navy; it helped to cut off the vital sea link between the French possessions in India and France.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The English held three important places, namely, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras whereas the French had only Pondicherry.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The French subordinated their commercial interest to territorial ambition, which made the French company short of funds.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">In spite of their imperialistic motives, the British never neglected their commercial interests. So they always had the funds and the consequent sound financial condition to help them significantly in the wars against their rivals.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">A major factor in the success of the English in India was the superiority of the commanders in the British camp. In comparison to the long list of leaders on the English side</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—Sir Eyre Coote, Major Stringer Lawrence, Robert Clive and many others—there was only Dupleix on the French side.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s15" style=" background-color: #6D6E70;">              About the Goods in Trade Initially             </span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">There are accounts by various European travellers and traders about the  activities  in  port  towns  such  as  Surat  which  give  details  of the intricate steps that went into the creation of fabrics collectively called ‘Indian’.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Great demand was there for cotton longcloth, (usually 35 to</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">50 m in length), salempores (staple cotton cloth), and morees (superior quality cotton cloth). Other much desired fabrics were the painted cloths and prints, the silks and dyes. These textiles were not just in demand in Europe but also in other parts of Asia. Indians had traded in textiles for centuries before the Europeans arrived. In China, Japan and the Indonesian archipelago, Indian cotton was popular for its lightweight, yet strong qualities. When the Dutch, English and French acquired materials from India, it was not only for their home countries, but for transport to Malacca or Java, for example, where they were traded for spices. By the 18th century, the French had coloured patterned handkerchiefs specially woven for particular island markets - which proved a successful entrepreneurial effort.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">A corollary to the trade in textiles and spices was the trade in slaves. It is generally considered that slave trade concerned Europe, Africa, and the Americas (the ‘New World’), but this ignores the fact that trade between Europe and Asia also helped to sustain slavery. French ships took European goods to Asia, where they acquired cowry shells and Indian textiles that were highly valued in West Africa. Traders exchanged these goods in Africa for slaves, who were sent to the colonies of France in the Americas. “The circle was completed,” says the Yale Center for the Study of Globalisation, “when sugar and other goods from the Americas were loaded on board and shipped back to France.”</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">When the French East India Company started trading in India, they entered an already well established, complex economic system, an intricate network of production, negotiation, delivery, and distribution. Large commercial fleets as well as prosperous shore-based businesses were run by Indian merchants. Weavers and merchants worked with overland freight operators and brokers, who worked with exporters and ship owners. These agents had also to negotiate with local state officials for commercial privileges. The European traders had to learn well established rules and practices and successfully collaborate with indigenous envoys.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The factories of all the European trading groups were to be found in practically the same places. At the peak of the Indian trade, the demand for Indian goods exceeded the supply by weavers and other artisans; even so there was no serious rivalry initially.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">But as the three companies—the Dutch, the English and the French—grew more competitive, the English, better funded and better conversant in local business practices and customs, were able to expand their factory outposts to larger industrial towns under their jurisdiction. Gradually, these commercial strongholds turned into political enclaves, ultimately enabling the English to expand and consolidate their power and control all over India.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part57.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part59.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
