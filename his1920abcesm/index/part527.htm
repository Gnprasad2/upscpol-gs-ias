On that day, a countrywide <i>hartal </i>was organised and mass rallies held. Wherever the commission went, there were black flag demonstrations, <i>hartals </i>and slogans of ‘Simon Go Back’. A significant feature of this upsurge was that a new generation of youth got their first taste of political action.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent:  5pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s15" style=" background-color: #6D6E70;">       Dr Ambedkar and the Simon Commission       </span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Dr Ambedkar was appointed by the Bombay Legislative Council to work with the Simon Commission. In October 1928, Ambedkar went before the commission.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">He argued for ‘universal adult franchise’ for both male and</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">female alike; for provincial autonomy in the provinces and dyrarchy at Centre. (Significantly, universal adult franchise was at the time yet to be guaranteed in most of European countries.)</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">On behalf of the <i>Bahishkrita Hitakarini Sabha</i>, he submitted a memorandum on the rights and safeguards he felt were required for the depressed classes.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Ambedkar said that there was no link between the depressed classes and the Hindu community, and stated that the depressed classes should be regarded as a distinct and independent minority.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">He asserted that the depressed classes as a minority needed far greater political protection than any other minority in British India because of its educational backwardness, its economically poor condition, its social enslavement, and for the reason that it suffered from certain grave political disabilities, from which no other community suffered.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">In the circumstances, Dr Ambedkar demanded, for the political protection of the depressed classes, representation on the same basis as the Mohammedan minority. He wanted reserved seats for the depressed classes if universal adult franchise was granted. In case universal franchise was not granted, Ambedkar said he would campaign for a separate electorate for the depressed classes.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">He also expressed the need to have certain safeguards either in the constitution, if it was possible, or else “in the way of advice in the instrument to the governor regarding the education of the depressed classes and their entry into the public services”.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">[The report of the Simon Commission did grant reserved seats to the depressed classes, but the condition was that candidates who would take part in the elections would have, first of all, to get their competence endorsed by the governor of the province. Ambedkar was most displeased with this but, in any case, this report remained a dead letter.]</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">They played the most active part in the protest, giving it a militant flavour. The youth leagues and conferences got a real fillip.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Nehru and Subhash Bose emerged as leaders of this new wave of youth and students. Both travelled extensively, addressed and presided over conferences.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">This upsurge among the youth also provided a fertile ground for the germination and spread of new radical ideas of socialism reflected in the emergence of groups such as the Punjab Naujawan Bharat Sabha, Workers’ and Peasants’ Parties and Hindustani Sewa Dal (Karnataka).</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part526.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part528.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
