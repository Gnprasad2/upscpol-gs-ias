On their part, most of the Indian rulers did not have enough money</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">to pay salaries regularly. The Marathas at times diverted their military campaigns to collect revenue so as to pay their troops. Also, the Indian rulers were dependent on personal retinues or a rabble of mercenary elements who were not amenable to discipline and could turn rebellious or join the opponents when the going was not good.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Civil Discipline and Fair Selection System <span class="p">The Company officers and troops were given charge on the basis of their reliability and skill and not on hereditary or caste and clan ties. They themselves were subject to strict discipline and were aware of the objectives of their campaigns. In contrast, the Indian administrators and military officers were appointed on the basis of caste and personal relations, often disregarding merit and ability. As a result, their competence was doubtful and they often tended to be rebellious and disloyal in order to pursue their own interests.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part103.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part105.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
