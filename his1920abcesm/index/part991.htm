In order to initiate the process of the establishment of durable peace, both the Governments agree that:</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent:  9pt;text-align: justify;">● <span class="s11">Indian and Pakistani forces shall be withdrawn to their side of the international border.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent:  9pt;text-align: justify;">● <span class="s11">In Jammu and Kashmir, the line of control resulting from the cease-fire of December 17, 1971 shall be respected by both sides without prejudice to the recognized position of either side. Neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations. Both sides further undertake to refrain from the threat or the use of force in violation of this Line.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent:  9pt;text-align: justify;">● <span class="s11">The withdrawals shall commence upon entry into force of this Agreement and shall be completed within a period of</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">30 days thereof.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">5.
