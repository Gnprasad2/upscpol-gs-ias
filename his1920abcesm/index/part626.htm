Gandhi and his supporters were not in favour of an immediate struggle because they felt that the</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">allied cause was just;</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">communal sensitiveness and lack of Hindu-Muslim unity could result in communal riots;</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">Congress organisation was in shambles and the atmosphere was not conducive for a mass struggle; and</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">masses were not ready for a struggle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">They instead advocated toning up the Congress organisation, carrying on political work among the masses, and negotiating till all possibilities of a negotiated settlement were exhausted. Only then would the struggle be begun.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In January 1940, Linlithgow stated, “Dominion status of Westminster variety, after the war, is the goal of British policy in India.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In its meeting in Allahabad in November 1939, the Congress Working Committee passed a resolution observing that “the course of the war and the policy pursued by the British and the French governments and in particular the declarations made on behalf of the British government in regard to India, seem to demonstrate that the present war, like the World War of 1914-18, is being carried on for imperialist ends, and the British imperialism is to remain entrenched in India. With such a war and with this policy the Congress cannot associate itself, and it cannot countenance the exploitation of India’s resources to this end.” It was reiterated that India’s independence and of the right of Indians to frame their constitution through a constituent assembly should  be  recognised  and  that  it  was  only  through  such  a constituent assembly that communal and other problems could be tackled.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The <b>Ramgarh session </b>of the Congress was held in March 1940 with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad in the president’s chair. All agreed that a battle must be waged but there was disagreement over the form. It was decided to leave the form and timing to Gandhi. But even now, Gandhi was in favour of continued cooperation at the provincial level. He said that he would offer the British moral support during the war but on a non-violent basis. However, Jawaharlal Nehru reiterated that complete independence for India must be a precondition for Congress support to the British war effort. Subhash Bose continued with his strong militant stand of direct action against the colonial government forcing it to agree to the grant of freedom. Once again he pointed out that Britain’s difficulty was to be seized as India’s opportunity.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Congress finally declared at the session that the</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">people of India would accept nothing short of complete independence. Indian freedom could not be in the form of dominion or any other status within the imperial structure. Sovereignty, said the Congress resolution, must rest with the people, whether in the States (the princely states) or the provinces. It was also decided that “Congress would resort to civil disobedience as soon as the Congress organisation is considered fit enough or if circumstances precipitate a crisis.”</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part625.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part627.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
