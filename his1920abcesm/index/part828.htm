Even the inadequate measures the government took for the expansion of modern education were guided by concerns other than philanthropic. The government measures for promotion of education were influenced by—</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">agitation in favour of modern education by enlightened Indians, Christian missionaries and humanitarian officials;</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">the need to ensure a cheap supply of educated Indians to man an increasing number of subordinate posts in administration and in British business concerns—thus there was an emphasis on English medium as the language of administration and of education;</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">the hope that educated Indians would help expand market for British manufactures in India;</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">an expectation that Western education would reconcile Indians to British rule, particularly as it glorified British conquerors and their administration.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The British thus wanted to use modern education to strengthen the foundations of their political authority in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">2. Traditional system of Indian learning gradually declined for want of support, and specially after 1844 when it was declared that applicants for government employment should possess knowledge of English.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">3. Mass education was neglected leading to widespread illiteracy (1911—84 per cent and in 1921—92 per cent) which created a wide linguistic and cultural gulf between the educated few and the masses.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">4. Since education was to be paid for, it became a monopoly of upper and richer classes and city dwellers.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">5. There was an almost total neglect of women’s education because (i) the Government did not want to arouse wrath of orthodox sections; and (ii) it had no immediate utility for the colonial rule.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">6. Scientific and technical education was by and large neglected. By 1857 there were only three medical colleges at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, and only one good engineering college at Roorkee which was open only to Europeans and Eurasians.</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Chapter 31</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Peasant  Movements 1857-1947</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Peasantry Under Colonialism</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The impoverishment of the Indian peasantry was a direct result of the transformation of the agrarian structure due to—</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">colonial economic policies,</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent:  9pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">ruin of the handicrafts leading to overcrowding of land,</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">the new land revenue system,</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">colonial administrative and judicial system.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The peasants suffered from high rents, illegal levies, arbitrary evictions and unpaid labour in zamindari areas. In Ryotwari areas, the government itself levied heavy land revenue. The overburdened farmer, fearing loss of his only source of livelihood, often approached the local moneylender who made full use of the former’s difficulties by extracting high rates of interests on the money lent. Often, the farmer had to mortgage his land and cattle. Sometimes, the money- lender seized the mortgaged belongings. Gradually, over large areas, the actual cultivators were reduced to the status of tenants-at-will, share croppers and landless labourers.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The peasants often resisted the exploitation, and soon they realised that their real enemy was the colonial state. Sometimes, the desperate peasants took to crime to come out of intolerable conditions. These crimes included robbery, dacoity and what has been called social banditry.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">574</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part827.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part829.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
