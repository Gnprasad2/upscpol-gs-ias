The idea was to have two provinces: Bengal comprising Western Bengal as well as the provinces of Bihar and Orissa, and Eastern Bengal and Assam. Bengal retained Calcutta as its capital, while Dacca became the capital of Eastern Bengal. The official reason given for the decision was that Bengal with a population of 78 million (about a quarter of the population of British India) had become too big to be administered. It was also stated that partition would help in the development of Assam if it came under the direct jurisdiction of the government. This was true to some extent, but the real motive behind the partition plan was seen to be the British desire to weaken Bengal, the nerve centre of Indian nationalism. This it sought to achieve by putting the Bengalis under two administrations by dividing them:</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) on the basis of language, thus reducing the Bengalis to a minority in Bengal itself (as in the new proposal Bengal proper was to have 17 million</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">View</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Bengal  united  is  a  power.  Bengal  divided  will  pull  in  several different  ways.   One  of  our  main  objects  is  to  split  up  and</p><p class="s11" style="text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">thereby  to  weaken  a  solid  body  of  opponents  to  our rule.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 147pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—Risley <span class="s11">(home secretary to the Government of India, 1904)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Bengalis and 37 million Hindi and Oriya speakers); and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(ii) on the basis of religion, as the western half was to be a Hindu majority area (42 million out of a total 54 million) and the eastern half was to be a Muslim majority area (18 million out of a total of</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">31 million).</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Trying to woo the Muslims, Curzon, the viceroy at that time, argued that Dacca could become the capital of the new Muslim majority province, which would provide them with a unity not experienced by them since the days of old Muslim viceroys and kings. Thus, it was clear that the government was up to its old policy of propping up Muslim communalists to counter the Congress and the national movement.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part383.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part385.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
