They worked out a set of measures that came to be known as the <b>Morley- Minto (or Minto-Morley) Reforms </b>that translated into the <b>Indian Councils Act of 1909</b>.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">The elective principle was recognised for the non- official membership of the councils in India. Indians were allowed to participate in the election of various legislative councils, though on the basis of class and community.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">For the first time, separate electorates for Muslims for election to the central council was established—a most detrimental step for India.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">The number of elected members in the Imperial Legislative Council and the Provincial Legislative Councils was increased. In the provincial councils, non-official majority was introduced, but since some of these non-officials were nominated and not elected, the overall non-elected majority remained.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">According to Sumit Sarkar, in the Imperial Legislative Council, of the total 69 members, 37 were to be the officials and of the 32 non-officials, 5 were to be nominated. Of the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">27 elected non-officials, 8 seats were reserved for the Muslims under separate electorates (only Muslims could vote here for the Muslim candidates), while 4 seats were reserved for the British capitalists, 2 for the landlords and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">13 seats came under general electorate.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">The elected members were to be indirectly elected. The local bodies were to elect an electoral college, which in turn would elect members of provincial legislatures, who in turn would elect members of the central legislature.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">Besides separate electorates for the Muslims, representation in excess of the strength of their population was accorded to the Muslims. Also, the income qualification for Muslim voters was kept lower than that for Hindus.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Views</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Reforms  may  not  save  the  Raj,  but  if  they  don’t,  nothing  else will.                                                                      <b>Lord  Morley</b></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The reforms of 1909 afforded no answer, and could afford no answer to Indian problems.</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Montford Report</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Political barrier was created round them, isolating them from the rest of India and reversing the unifying and amalgamating process which had been going on for centuries... The barrier was a small one at first, for the electorates were very limited, but with every extension of franchise it grew and affected the whole structure of political and social life like some canker which corrupted the entire system.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Jawaharlal Nehru</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">Powers of legislatures—both at the centre and in provinces—were enlarged and the legislatures could now pass resolutions (which may or may not be accepted), ask questions and supplementaries, vote separate items in the budget though the budget as a whole could not be voted upon.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">One Indian was to be appointed to the viceroy’s executive council (Satyendra Sinha was the first Indian to be appointed in 1909).</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part410.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part412.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
