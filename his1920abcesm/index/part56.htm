Dupleix, the French governor who had successfully led the French forces in the First Carnatic War, sought to increase his power and French political influence in southern India by interfering in local dynastic disputes to defeat the English.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Immediate Cause <span class="p">The opportunity was provided by the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk, the founder of the independent kingdom of Hyderabad, in 1748, and the release of Chanda Sahib, the son-in-law of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">by the Marathas in the same year. The accession of Nasir Jang, the son of the Nizam, to the throne of Hyderabad was opposed by Muzaffar Jang, the grandson of the Nawab, who laid claim to the throne saying that the Mughal Emperor had appointed him as the governor of the Carnatic. In the Carnatic, the appointment of Anwar-ud-din Khan as the Nawab was resented by Chanda Sahib.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The French supported the claims of Muzaffar Jang and Chanda Sahib in the Deccan and Carnatic, respectively, while the English sided with Nasir Jang and Anwar-ud-din.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Course of the War <span class="p">The combined armies of Muzaffar Jang, Chanda Sahib and the French defeated and killed Anwar- ud-din at the Battle of Ambur (near Vellore) in 1749. Muzaffar Jang became the subahdar of Deccan, and Dupleix was appointed governor of all the Mughal territories to the south of the River Krishna. A French army under Bussy was stationed at Hyderabad to secure French interests there. Territories near Pondicherry and also some areas on the Orissa coast (including Masulipatnam) were ceded to the French.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Having failed to provide effective assistance to Muhammad Ali at Trichinopoly, Robert Clive, then an agent (‘factor’) of the English company, put forward the proposal for a diversionary attack on the governor of Madras, Saunders. He suggested a sudden raid on Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, so as to relieve the pressure on Trichinopoly. He reasoned that in such an event Chanda Sahib would rush to save his capital. Thus, in August 1751, with only a force of</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">210 men Robert Clive attacked and captured Arcot. As expected, Chanda Sahib hastened to his capital, taking a force of 4,000 men from Trichinopoly, but failed to get back the fort even after a siege of 53 days, from September 23 to November 14. Now Mysore, Tanjore and the Maratha chief, Morari Rao, came to the aid of Trichinopoly, and of Clive and Stringer Lawrence. Trichinopoly was first relieved of its siege, while General Law of France with Chanda Sahib remained cooped up in the island of Srirangam. They were forced to surrender in June 1752 when Muhammad Ali executed Chanda Sahib, the British failing to interfere.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s15" style=" background-color: #6D6E70;">              Rise and Fall of Dupleix in India               </span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Joseph Francis Dupleix, born in 1697, was the son of a wealthy Farmer-General of Taxes and Director-General of the Company of the Indies. He got a high post at Pondicherry in 1720, allegedly on the basis of influence of his father. At Pondicherry he made a lot of money by private trade, which was then permitted to servants of the French company. In December 1726, he was suspended owing to drastic change in the constitution of the French company and some confusions arising out of that. In 1730, Dupleix won his case, and was appointed as governor of Chandernagore as compensation. In 1741, he was appointed as the Director-General of French colonies in India. Later, he was conferred the title of Nawab by the Mughal emperor and the subahdar of Deccan, Muzzaffar Jang.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">According to historians, Dupleix possessed qualities of an administrator, a diplomat, and a leader besides having political insight with a broad vision.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Dupleix in the Role of Administrator</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">In 1741, Dupleix became the Governor-General of Pondicherry. He found Pondicherry facing several problems—Maratha invasion, famine, uncultivated land and chaotic conditions in the Carnatic. Apart from these, the Directors of the Company sought a drastic cut in expenditure of the French East India Company, owing to the priority given to the French colonies in North America. So, Dupleix reduced public expenditure, despite opposition from his council, and balanced income and expenditure, coupled with a cut on salaries of officers. However, he decided to disobey the directors on the matter of fortification of settlements. He enhanced the defences of Pondicherry, even spending a large sum from his personal wealth. He made Pondicherry the emporium of commerce in south India by taking practical steps to develop the trade of the colony. Later, the Directors of the Company praised Dupleix for taking the right decisions, even in contradiction of the directors.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Dupleix as a Master of Diplomacy</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The analysis of the first two Carnatic wars proves the diplomacy of Dupleix as a leader who visualised the path of the European conquest of India.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Dupleix used the Nawab of Carnatic to forbid the English from waging war in his territories so that the French settlements at Pondicherry could be protected till the French forces acquired enough strength. In return the nawab was promised Madras after the English got defeated. But Dupleix, using his diplomacy, didn’t</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">give Madras to the nawab and even defeated him at St. Thome (1746).</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Dupleix convinced Admiral La Bourdonnais to break promises made to the English, citing examples from history that promises made under certain circumstances were never binding. Further, he said that since the position of the governor-general was superior to that of the commander of navy, the compact entered into between the latter and the English was <i>ultra vires. </i>Thus, he was able to convince his subordinate to do what was considered unethical in general terms, but best suited for one’s nation.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Dupleix was the first European to interfere in the internal politics of the Indian rulers. He supported Muzzaffar Jang for Hyderabad and Chanda Sahib for Carnatic and his candidates emerged successful and, in return, gave great concessions to Dupleix.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Dupleix was, in fact, the originator of the practice of subsidiary alliance in India. He placed a French army at Hyderabad at the expense of the subahdar.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Why Dupleix Failed in India</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Dupleix was recalled in 1754 due to the initial defeat of the French army in the Second Carnatic War and the heavy cost incurred by the company due to Dupleix’s political decisions. Many historians have called the recall of Dupleix by the directors as a blunder—a result of a compromise between France and England over issues in America. However, there were some weaknesses in Dupleix also, which can be put in brief as follows:</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(i) Dupleix suffered from an over-sanguine temperament. He hoped too often for too long, thus losing the advantage in critical situations.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) The peers of Dupleix didn’t like his autocratic behaviour and on many occasions quarrelled with him on this matter.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) Dupleix was not a man of action: he planned a campaign, directed his lieutenants, but never led an army in the battlefield like Lawrence or Clive. The French failed to capture Trichinopoly (1752-53) because the schemes thought out by Dupleix could not be turned into action by his commanders.</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Result <span class="p">The French authorities, annoyed at the heavy financial losses that Dupleix’s policy involved, decided to recall him in 1754. Godeheu succeeded Dupleix as the French governor-general in India. Godeheu adopted a policy of negotiations with the English and concluded a treaty with them. The English and the French agreed not to interfere in</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Views</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The struggle between Dupleix and Clive in India, the defence of Arcot and the deeds which led to the founding of our Indian Empire… all these events were part of a desperate struggle for supremacy between England and France.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 196pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—<b>J.R. Seeley</b></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">We may regard Dupleix as the most striking figure in the short Indian episode of that long and arduous contest for transmarine dominion which was fought out between France and England in the eighteenth century, although it was far beyond his power to influence the ultimate destiny of either nation in India, and although the result of his plans was that ‘we accomplished for ourselves against the French exactly everything that the French intended to accomplish for themselves against us’ (Clive). It is certain, moreover, that the conception of an Indian Empire had already been formed by others besides Dupleix, and that more than one clearheaded observer had perceived how easily the whole country might be subdued by an European power.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 195pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—<b>Alfred Lyall</b></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">the quarrels of native princes. Also, each party was left in possession of the territories actually occupied by them at the time of the treaty. According to historians, the fear of serious repercussions in America prompted the French to suspend hostilities in India.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Implications <span class="p">It became evident that the countenance of Indian authority was no longer necessary for European success; rather Indian authority itself was becoming dependent on European support.
