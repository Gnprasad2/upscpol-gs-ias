Instead, they found tumultuous crowds impatient to do something. Popular energy resurfaced after three years of repression. People’s expectations were</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">462</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">heightened by the release of their leaders. The Wavell Plan backed by the Conservative government in Britain failed to break the constitutional deadlock.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In July 1945, Labour Party formed the government in Britain. Clement Attlee took over as the new prime minister and Pethick Lawrence as the new secretary of state for India.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In August 1945, elections to central and provincial assemblies were announced.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In September 1945, it was announced that a constituent assembly would be convened after the elections and that the government was working according to the spirit of the Cripps Offer.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The government’s change attitude was dictated by the following factors.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">1. The end of the War resulted in a change in balance of global power—the UK was no more a big power while the USA and USSR emerged as superpowers, both of which favoured freedom for India.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">2. The new Labour government was more sympathetic to Indian demands.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">3. Throughout Europe, there was a wave of socialist- radical governments.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">4. British soldiers were weary and tired and the British economy lay shattered. (By 1945 the British government in London owed India £1.2 billion and was being drained by the US Lend-Lease agreement, which was finally paid off only in 2006.)</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">5. There was an anti-imperialist wave in South-East Asia—in Vietnam and Indonesia—resisting efforts to replant French and Dutch rule there.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">6. Officials feared  another  Congress  revolt,  a  revival of the 1942 situation but much more dangerous because of a likely combination of attacks on communications, agrarian revolts, labour trouble, army disaffection joined by government officials and the police in the presence of INA men with some military experience.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">7. Elections were inevitable once the war ended since the last elections had been held in 1934 for the Centre and in 1937 for the provinces.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The British would have had to retreat; the Labour government only quickened the process somewhat.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part662.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part664.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
