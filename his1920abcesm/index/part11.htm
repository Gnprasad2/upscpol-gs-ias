The first attempts to publish newspapers in India were made by the disgruntled employees of the English East India Company who sought to expose the malpractices of private trade. For instance, in 1776, William Bolts, being censured by the Court of Directors for private trading, resigned from the Company and announced his intention to publish a newspaper. The official response to Bolts’ scheme was strong and his plan ended before materialising. In 1780, James Augustus Hickey published the first newspaper in India entitled <i>The Bengal Gazette </i>or <i>Calcutta General Advertiser</i>. Hickey’s press was seized within two years, owing to his outspoken criticism of government officials. Afterwards, many publications appeared such as <i>The Calcutta Gazette </i>(1784), <i>The Madras Courier </i>(1788) and <i>The Bombay Herald </i>(1789). The newspapers and journals of the early period primarily aimed at catering to the intellectual entertainment of the Europeans and Anglo-Indians.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">From the second half of the 19th century, many powerful newspapers appeared, edited/published by distinguished and fearless journalists. Interestingly, nearly</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">one-third of the founding fathers of the Indian National Congress in 1885 were journalists. Some of their publications were: <i>The Hindu </i>and <i>Swadesamitran </i>under the editorship of G. Subramaniya Iyer, <i>Kesari </i>and <i>Mahratta </i>under Bal Gangadhar Tilak, <i>Bengalee </i>under Surendranath Banerjea, <i>Amrita Bazaar Patrika </i>under Sisir Kumar Ghosh and Motilal Ghosh, <i>Sudharak </i>under Gopal Krishna Gokhale, <i>Indian Mirror </i>under N.N. Sen, <i>Voice of India </i>under Dadabhai Naoroji, <i>Hindustan </i>and <i>Advocate </i>under G.P. Varma. The <i>Tribune </i>and <i>Akhbar-i-Am </i>in Punjab, <i>Indu Prakash, Dnyan Prakash, Kal </i>and <i>Gujarati </i>in Bombay, and <i>Som Prakash Banganivasi </i>and <i>Sadharani </i>in Bengal were other noted newspapers of the time. Indian nationalists and revolutionaries living abroad published newspapers and journals—<i>Indian Sociologist </i>(London, Shyamji Krishnavarma), <i>Bande Matram </i>(Paris, Madam Cama), <i>Talwar </i>(Berlin, Virendranath Chattopadhyay), and <i>Ghadar </i>(San Francisco, Lala Hardayal)— to infuse a feeling of nationalism among Indians living abroad.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Newspapers depict almost all aspects of life in colonial India from around the 1870s onwards. From the 1920s onwards, newspapers tracked the major events during the freedom struggle. However, newspaper accounts cannot be seen as unprejudiced or completely objective. The accounts that were published in a newspaper in London by the pro- British Raj people were bound to be different from the report in an Indian nationalist paper.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part10.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part12.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
