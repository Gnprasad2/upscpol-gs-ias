The conflicts of ruling classes during the medieval phase were distorted and exaggerated as Hindu- Muslim conflicts.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Historians ignored the fact that politics, ancient and medieval as of all times and anywhere, was based on economic and political interests and not on religious considerations.

On its part, the Hindu communal view of history chose to project the view that Indian society and culture had reached ideal heights in the ancient period from which they began to decay in the medieval period because of ‘Muslim’ rule. In this, there was a refusal to acknowledge how Indian economy and technology, religion and philosophy, arts and literature, culture and society had developed and been enriched in the medieval period.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Side-effects of Socio-religious Reform Movements <span class="p">Reform  movements  such  as  the  Wahabi  Movement  among Muslims and Shuddhi among Hindus with their militant overtones made the role of religion more vulnerable to communalism. Reforms, at times, were seen as a process of insulating one community from the influence of another religious community.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part694.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part696.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
