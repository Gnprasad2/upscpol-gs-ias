National leaders urged the government to do so for British India (Gokhale made a powerful advocacy for it in the Legislative Assembly).</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In its 1913 Resolution on Education Policy, the government refused to take up the responsibility of compulsory education, but accepted the policy of removal of illiteracy and urged provincial governments to take early steps to provide free elementary education to the poorer and more backward sections. Private efforts were to be encouraged for this and the quality of secondary schools was to be improved. A university, it was decided, was to be established in each province and teaching activities of universities were to be encouraged.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Saddler University Commission (1917-19) <span class="p">The commission was set up to study and report on problems of Calcutta University but its recommendations were applicable more or less to other universities also. It reviewed the entire field from school education to university education. It held the view that, for the improvement of university education, improvement of secondary education was a necessary pre-condition. Its observations were as follows:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">1. School course should cover 12 years. Students should enter university after an intermediate stage (rather than matric) for a three-year degree course in university. This was done to</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(a) prepare students for university stage;</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(b) relieve universities of a large number of below university standard students; and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(c) provide collegiate education to those not planning to go through university stage.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">A separate board of secondary and intermediate education should be set up for administration and control of secondary and intermediate education.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">2. There should be less rigidity in framing university regulations.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">3. A university should function as centralised, unitary residential-teaching autonomous body, rather than as scattered, affiliated colleges.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">4. Female education, applied scientific and technological education, teachers’ training including those for professional and vocational colleges should be extended.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In the period from 1916 to 1921 seven new universities came up at Mysore, Patna, Benaras, Aligarh, Dacca, Lucknow and Osmania.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In 1920, the Government recommended Saddler report to the provincial governments.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part821.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part823.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
