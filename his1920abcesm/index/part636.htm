Various parties and groups had objections to the proposals on different points—</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Congress objected to:</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) the offer of dominion status instead of a provision for complete independence;</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(ii) representation of the princely states by nominees and not by elected representatives;</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(iii) right to provinces to secede as this went against the principle of national unity; and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(iv) absence of any plan for immediate transfer of power and absence of any real share in defence; the governor-general’s supremacy had been retained, and the demand that the governor-general be only the constitutional head had not been accepted.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Nehru and Maulana Azad were the official negotiators for the Congress.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Muslim League</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) criticised the idea of a single Indian Union;</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(ii) did not like the machinery for the creation of a constituent assembly and the procedure to decide on the accession of provinces to the Union; and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(iii) thought that the proposals denied the Muslims the right to self-determination and the creation of Pakistan.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Other groups also objected to the provinces’ right to secede. The Liberals considered the secession proposals to be against the unity and security of India. The Hindu Mahasabha criticised the basis of the right to secede. The depressed classes thought that partition would leave them at the mercy of the caste Hindus. The Sikhs objected that partition would take away Punjab from them.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The explanation that the proposals were meant not to supersede the August Offer but to clothe general provisions with precision cast doubts on the British intentions.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The incapacity of Cripps to go beyond the Draft Declaration and the adoption of a rigid “take it or leave it” attitude added to the deadlock. Cripps had earlier talked of “cabinet” and “national government” but later he said that he had only meant an expansion of the executive council.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The procedure of accession was not well-defined. The decision on secession was to be taken by a resolution in the legislature by a 60 per cent majority. If less than 60 per cent</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Views</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">I have not become His Majesty’s first Minister to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 177pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Winston Churchill</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The offer of Cripps really gave us nothing. If we accepted his offer, we might have cause to rue it in future. In case the British went back on their word, we should not even have the justification for launching a fresh struggle. War had given India an opportunity for achieving her freedom. We must not lose it by depending upon a mere promise.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 142pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Maulana Abul Kalam Azad</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">of members supported it, the decision was to be taken by a plebiscite of adult males of that province by a simple majority. This scheme weighed against the Hindus in Punjab and Bengal if they wanted accession to the Indian Union.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">It was not clear as to who would implement and interpret the treaty effecting the transfer of power.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Churchill (the British prime minister), Amery (the secretary of state), Linlithgow (the viceroy) and Ward (the commander-in-chief) consistently torpedoed Cripps’ efforts. Talks broke down on the question of the viceroy’s veto.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Gandhi described the scheme as “a post-dated cheque”; Nehru pointed out that the “existing structure and autocratic powers would remain and a few of us will become the viceroy’s liveried camp followers and look after canteens and the like”.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Stafford Cripps returned home leaving behind a frustrated and embittered Indian people, who, though still sympathising with the victims of Fascist aggression, felt that the existing situation in the country had become intolerable and that the time had come for a final assault on imperialism.</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part637.htm">Summary</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part635.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part637.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
