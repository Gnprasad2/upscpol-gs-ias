His efforts in South Africa were well known not only among the educated but also among the masses. He decided to tour the country the next one  year  and  see  for  himself  the  condition  of  the  masses. He also decided not to take any position on any political matter for at least one year. As for the political currents prevalent at that time in India, he was convinced about the limitations of moderate politics and was also not in favour of Home Rule agitation which was becoming popular at that time. He thought that it was not the best time to agitate for Home Rule when Britain was in the middle of a war. He was convinced that the only technique capable of meeting the nationalist aims was a non-violent satyagraha. He also said that he would join no political organisation unless it too accepted the creed of non-violent satyagraha.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">During 1917 and 1918, Gandhi was involved in three struggles—in Champaran, Ahmedabad and Kheda—before he launched the Rowlatt Satyagraha.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part461.htm">Champaran Satyagraha (1917)—First Civil Disobedience</a><a class="toc0" href="part462.htm">Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918)— First Hunger Strike</a><a class="toc0" href="part463.htm">Kheda Satyagraha (1918)—First Non-Cooperation</a><a class="toc0" href="part464.htm">Gains from Champaran, Ahmedabad and Kheda</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part459.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part461.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
