Though the Maratha army had a larger number of soldiers than the English, the latter had highly superior ammunition and cannons. However, the Maratha army was commanded by a brilliant general named Mahadji Sindhia (also known as Mahadji Shinde). Mahadji lured the English army into the ghats (mountain passes) near Talegaon and trapped the English from all sides and attacked the English supply base at Khopali. The Marathas also utilised a <b>scorched earth policy</b>, burning farmland and poisoning wells. As the English began to withdraw to Talegaon, the Marathas attacked, forcing them to retreat to the village of Wadgaon. Here, the English army was surrounded on all sides by the Marathas and cut off from food and water supplies. The English surrendered by mid-January 1779 and signed the <i><b>Treaty of Wadgaon </b></i>that forced the Bombay government to relinquish all territories acquired by the English since 1775.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Treaty of Salbai (1782): End of the First Phase of the Struggle <span class="p">Warren Hastings, the Governor-General in Bengal, rejected the Treaty of Wadgaon and sent a large force of soldiers under Colonel Goddard who captured Ahmedabad in February 1779, and Bassein in December 1780. Another Bengal detachment led by Captain Popham captured Gwalior in August 1780. In February 1781 the English, under General Camac, finally defeated Sindhia at Sipri.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Sindhia proposed a new treaty between the Peshwa and the English, and the Treaty of Salbai was signed in May 1782; it was ratified by Hastings in June 1782 and by Phadnavis in February 1783. The treaty guaranteed peace between the two sides for twenty years. The main provisions of the Treaty of Salbai were:</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(i) Salsette should continue in the possession of the English.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(ii) The whole of the territory conquered since the Treaty of Purandhar (1776) including Bassein should be restored to the Marathas.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(iii) In Gujarat, Fateh Singh Gaekwad should remain in possession of the territory which he had before the war and should serve the Peshwa as before.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(iv) The English should not offer any further support to Raghunathrao and the Peshwa should grant him a maintenance allowance.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(v) Haidar Ali should return all the territory taken from the English and the Nawab of Arcot.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(vi) The English should enjoy the privileges at trade as before.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(vii) The Peshwa should not support any other European nation.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(viii) The Peshwa and the English should undertake that their several allies should remain at peace with one another.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(ix) Mahadji Sindhia should be the mutual guarantor for the proper observance of the terms of the treaty.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part142.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part144.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
