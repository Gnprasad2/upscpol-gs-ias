As a result of this, the reformers were subjected to abuse, persecution, issuing of <i>fatwas </i>and even assassination attempts by the reactionaries.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">However, in spite of opposition, these movements managed to contribute towards the liberation of the individual</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">from the conformity born out of fear and from uncritical submission to exploitation by the priests and other classes. The translation of religious texts into vernacular languages, emphasis on an individual’s right to interpret the scriptures and simplification of rituals made worship a more personal experience.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The movements emphasised the human intellect’s capacity to think and reason.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">By weeding out corrupt elements, religious beliefs and practices, the reformers enabled their followers to meet the official taunt that their religions and society were decadent and inferior.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The reform movements gave the rising middle classes the much needed cultural roots to cling to, and served the purpose of reducing the sense of humiliation which the conquest by a foreign power had produced.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">A realisation of the special needs of modern times, especially in terms of scientific knowledge, and thus promoting a modern, this-worldly, secular and rational outlook was a major contribution of these reform movements. Socially, this attitude  reflected  in  a  basic  change  in  the  notions  of ‘pollution and purity’. Although traditional values and customs were a prominent target of attack from the reformers, yet the reformers aimed at modernisation rather than outright westernisation based on blind imitation of alien Western cultural values. In fact, the reform movements sought to create a favourable social climate for modernisation. To that extent, these movements ended India’s cultural and intellectual isolation from the rest of the world. The reformers argued that modern ideas and culture could be best imbibed by integrating them into Indian cultural streams.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The underlying concern of these reformist efforts was revival of the native cultural personality which had got distorted by various factors over the years. This cultural ideological struggle was to prove to be an important instrument in the evolution of national consciousness and a part of Indian national resolve to resist colonial cultural and ideological hegemony. However, not all these progressive, nationalist tendencies were able to outgrow the sectarian and obscurantist</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">outlook. This was possibly due to the divergent duality of cultural and political struggles, resulting in cultural backwardness despite political advancement.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part337.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part339.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
