They pointed out that the pattern of foreign trade was unfavourable to India. It relegated India to a position of importer of finished goods and exporter of raw materials and foodstuffs. The development of railways, they argued, was not coordinated with India’s industrial needs and it ushered in a commercial rather than an industrial revolution.

In the former case the taxes collected from the population... are again returned to the industrious classes... But the case is wholly different when the taxes are not spent in the country from which they are raised... They constitute [an] absolute loss and extinction of the whole amount withdrawn from the taxed country... [The money] might as well be thrown into the sea. Such is the nature of the tribute we have so long exacted from India.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 163pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—<b>Sir George Wingate</b></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Under the native despot the people keep and enjoy what they produce, though at times they suffer some violence. Under the British Indian despot, the man is at peace, there is no violence; his substance is drained away, unseen, peaceably and subtly— he starves in peace, and peaceably perishes in peace, with law and order.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Dadabhai Naoroji</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">effect of the railways was to enable foreign goods to outsell indigenous products. Further, the benefits from impetus to steel, machinery and capital investment in railways accrued to the British. G.V. Joshi remarked, “Expenditure on railways should be seen as an Indian subsidy to British industries.”</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part794.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part796.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
