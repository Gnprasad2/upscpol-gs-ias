He kept with himself the portfolios of external affairs and atomic energy, though he later transferred the external affairs ministry to Swaran Singh. In his first broadcast to the nation as prime minister, Shastri said: “There comes a time in the life of every nation when it stands at the cross-roads of history and must choose which way to go. But for us there need be no difficulty or hesitation,  no  looking  to  right  or  left.  Our  way  is  straight and clear – the building up of a socialist democracy at home with freedom and prosperity for all, and the maintenance of</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">world peace and friendship with all nations.”</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">A true secularist at heart, Shastri said: “The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics. This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims herself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose, and worship in any way we please. So far as politics is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other.”</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">As prime minister, Shastri retained the main ministers of Nehru’s cabinet, but also drew Indira Gandhi, Nehru’s daughter, into his cabinet as information and broadcasting minister. He  respected Nehru  and kept true to the general policies created by the first prime minister of India, but he was not a blind follower of Nehru. In several ways, he showed he had a mind of his own.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Shastri was the first prime minister to have a secretary to the prime minister when he drew upon L.K. Jha, a senior ICS officer, to advise him. He thus laid the foundation of what later took the form of the Prime Minister’s Secretariat or the Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part944.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part946.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
