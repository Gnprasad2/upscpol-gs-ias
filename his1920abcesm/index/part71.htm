He was later called Bahadur Shah I). He had killed his brothers Muhammad Azam and Kam Bakhsh in the war of succession. Khafi Khan gave the title of Shah-i-Bekhabar to Bahadur Shah.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">He adopted a pacific policy with the Marathas, the Rajputs and the Jats. Shahu, the Maratha prince, was released from Mughal captivity, and Rajput chiefs were confirmed in their respective states. However, the Sikh leader Banda Bahadur attacked the Muslims in Punjab and hence the emperor took action against him. Bahadur Shah I died in February 1712.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Jahandar Shah (March 1712-February 1713) </b>With the help of Zulfikar Khan, Jahandar Shah became the emperor. Zulfikar Khan was appointed prime minister; he introduced <i>izara </i>system to improve the financial condition of the empire. Jahandar Shah abolished Jaziya.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Farrukhsiyar (1713-1719) </b>After killing Jahandar Shah with the help of Sayyid brothers—Abdulla Khan and Hussain Ali (known as ‘King Makers’), Farrukhsiyar became the new emperor. He followed a policy of religious tolerance by abolishing Jaziya and pilgrimage tax. In 1717, he gave <i>farmans  </i>to the British.  In 1719, the  Sayyid brothers, with the help of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, dethroned Farrukhsiyar. Later, he was blinded and killed. It was the first time in the Mughal history that  an emperor was  killed by his nobles.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Rafi-ud-Darajat (February 28 to June 4, 1719) <span class="p">He ruled for the shortest period among the Mughals.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">View</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">He (Bahadur Shah I) was the last Emperor of whom anything favourable can be said. Henceforth, the rapid and complete abasement and practical dissolution of the Empire are typified in the incapacity and political insignificance of its sovereigns.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—<b>Sidney Owen</b></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Rafi-ud-Daula (June 6 to September 17, 1719) <span class="p">The Sayyid brothers placed Rafi-ud-Daula with the title </span>Shah Jahan II <span class="p">on the throne. The new emperor was an opium addict.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><b>Muhammad Shah (1719-48) </b>After the death of Rafi- ud-Daula, Raushan Akhtar became the choice of the Sayyid Brothers. Muhammad Shah, as he came to be known in history, was given the title of ‘<i>Rangeela’ </i>due to his luxurious life-style.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Muhammad Shah, with the help of Nizam-ul-Mulk, killed the Sayyid Brothers. In 1724, Nizam-ul-Mulk became the <i>wazir </i>and founded the independent state of Hyderabad. In 1737, Baji Rao I, the Maratha Peshwa invaded Delhi with a small army of 500 horsemen. In 1739, Nadir Shah defeated the Mughals in the <b>Battle of Karnal </b>and later imprisoned Muhammad Shah and annexed areas west of the Indus into the Persian empire.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Ahmad Shah (1748-1754) <span class="p">Ahmad Shah was an incompetent ruler who left the state affairs in the hands of Udham Bai, the ‘Queen Mother’. Udham Bai, given the title of Qibla-i-Alam, was a lady of poor intellect who ruled with the help of her paramour, Javid Khan (a notorious eunuch). </span>Alamgir II (1754-1758) <span class="p">Alamgir II was a grandson of Jahandar Shah. Ahmed Shah Abdali, the Iranian invader, reached Delhi in January 1757.
