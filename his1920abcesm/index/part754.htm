The ruler- subject gap was sought to be narrowed so as to reduce, if not eliminate altogether, the alienation of the masses from the administration. Also, association of natives in administration could give the rulers an opportunity to have a better idea of the customs, traditions and values of the people they were supposed to rule. This could help them handle more tactfully an 1857-like situation.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The second half of the nineteenth century saw further spread and intensification of the industrial revolution. The emergence  of  new  industrial  powers—the  USA,  Japan  and European countries—and a cut-throat competition for colonies and sub-colonies for raw materials, markets for manufactured goods and capital investment were the highlights of this new phenomenon. The British supremacy in the world in finance and manufactured goods trade came to an end. At this point, there were large-scale British capital investments in railways and loans to the Government of India, and to a smaller extent in tea plantations, coal-mining, jute mills, shipping, trade and banking.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">All these factors combined to inaugurate a new stage</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">of colonialism in India. The prime concern of the colonial authority in India was to consolidate its position here to secure British economic and commercial interests against political dangers and to extend its sphere to other parts of the world, wherever and whenever possible. There was a renewed upsurge of imperial control and imperialist ideology which was reflected in the reactionary policies during the vice-royalties of Lytton, Dufferin, Lansdowne, Elgin and, above all, Curzon. The changes in the governmental structure</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">and policies in India were to shape the destiny of modern India in many ways.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part753.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part755.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
