The government further extended its control over the forest areas by setting up reserved forests and restricting timber use and grazing. This was the result of the increasing demand from the Company for timber— for shipping and the railways.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Exploitation by the police, traders and money-lenders (most of them ‘outsiders’) aggravated the tribals’ sufferings. Some general laws were also abhorred for their intrusive nature as the tribals had their own customs and traditions. With the expansion of colonialism, Christian missionaries came to these regions and their efforts interfered with the traditional customs of the tribals. The missionaries, perceived as representatives of the alien rule, were resented</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">by the tribals.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">The movements of the tribes of the north-eastern frontier were different from the non-frontier tribal revolts in some aspects.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">For one thing, the tribes which shared tribal and cultural links with countries across the border did not concern themselves much with the nationalist struggle. Their revolts were often in favour of political autonomy within the Indian Union or complete independence.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Secondly, these movements were not forest-based or agrarian revolts as these tribals were generally in control of land and forest area. The British entered the north-eastern areas much later than the non-frontier tribal areas.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Thirdly, the frontier tribal revolts under the British continued for a longer time than the non-frontier tribal movements. De-sanskritisation movements also spread among the frontier tribals. The Meiteis organised a movement during Churchand Maharaja’s rule (between 1891 and 1941) to denounce the malpractices of the neo-Vaishnavite Brahmins. Sanskritisation movements were almost totally absent in the north-east frontier region in the colonial period.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part230.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part232.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
