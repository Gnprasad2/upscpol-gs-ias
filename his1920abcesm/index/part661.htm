He decided to turn to the Japanese for help. The Japanese had till then encouraged Indian civilians to form anti-British organisations. Mohan Singh asked for Indian prisoners of war.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Japanese handed over the Indian prisoners of war to Mohan Singh who tried to recruit them into an Indian National Army. After the fall of Singapore, several POWs were ready to join Mohan Singh. By the end of 1942, 40,000 men were ready to join the INA. It was intended that the INA would go into action only on the invitation of the Indian National Congress and the people of India. The move to form this army has been seen by many as a check against the misconduct of the Japanese against Indians in South-East Asia and as a bulwark against a possible future Japanese occupation of India.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The INA got a boost with the outbreak of the Quit India Movement in India. In September 1942, the first division of the INA was formed with 16,300 men. With the Japanese contemplating an Indian invasion, the idea of an armed wing of INA seemed more relevant to them. But soon, serious differences emerged between the Indian Army officers led by Mohan Singh and the Japanese over the role to be played by the INA. Actually, the Japanese wanted a token force of 2,000 only while Mohan Singh wanted to raise a much larger army. Mohan Singh was taken into custoday by the Japanese. The second phase began with the arrival of Subhash</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Bose in Singapore. But before that in June 1943, Subhash Chandra Bose (under pseudo name Abid Hussain) reached Tokyo; met the Japanese prime minister, Tojo.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The role of Rasbehari Bose, another great freedom fighter, should also be acknowledged here. He had fled to Japan in 1915 following the failed revolutionary activities. In Japan, Rashbehari Bose eventually became a naturalised citizen. He made a lot of effort in getting the Japanese interested in the Indian independence movement. He became active in Pan-Asian circles, founded the Indian Club of Tokyo, and gave lectures on the evils of Western imperialism.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Very early itself he was impressed by Subhash Chandra Bose. When the Indian National Army was formed by Mohan Singh in Singapore, Rashbehari Bose was greatly excited and</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">left Tokyo for Southeast Asia. It was at a conference in Bangkok (also under Japanese occupation at the time) that it was decided to place the INA under an Indian Independence League whose chairman would be Rashbehari Bose himself. He had created the League in 1942 in Tokyo.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">When Subhash Bose was sought by the Japanese to lead the INA, he was ready for it. He went to Singapore and met Rashbehari Bose, and the latter happily transferred the control and leadership of the Indian Independence League and the INA to Subhash in July 1943. It must be noted that it was on the organisational spadework done by Rashbehari Bose that Subhas Bose could build up the Indian National Army. Subhash Bose became Supreme Commander of the INA on August 25. (In February 1944, after a collapse of the lungs, Rashbehari’s health steadily deteriorated, and he died on January 21, 1945, aged 58.)</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">On October  21, 1943, Subhash  Bose formed the Provisional Government for Free India at Singapore with H.C. Chatterjee (Finance portfolio), M.A. Aiyar (Broadcasting), Lakshmi Swaminathan (Women Department), etc. The famous slogan—“Give me blood, I will give you freedom” was given in Malaya.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">This provisional government declared war on Britain and the United States, and was recognised by the Axis powers. Recruits were trained and funds collected for the INA. A women’s regiment called the Rani Jhansi Regiment was also formed.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The INA headquarters was shifted to Rangoon (in Burma) in January 1944, and the army recruits were to march from there with the war cry “Chalo Delhi!” on their lips.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">On November 6, 1943, Andaman and Nicobar islands was given by the Japanese army to the INA; the islands were renamed as Shahid Dweep and Swaraj Dweep respectively. On July 6, 1944, Subhas Bose addressed Mahatma Gandhi as ‘Father of Nation’—from the Azad Hind Radio (the first person to call Gandhi, ‘Father of Nation’). He asked for Gandhi’s blessings for “India’s last war of independence”. One INA battalion commanded by Shah Nawaz was allowed to accompany the Japanese Army to the Indo-Burma front and participate in the Imphal campaign. However, the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Indians received discriminatory treatment from the Japanese, which included being denied rations and arms and being made to do menial work for the Japanese units, and this disgusted and demoralised the INA units.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Azad Hind Fauz crossed the Burma border, and stood on Indian soil on March 18, 1944. The INA units subsequently advanced up to Kohima and Imphal. On April 14, Colonel Malik of the  Bahadur Group hoisted the  INA flag for the first time on the Indian mainland at Moirang, in Manipur (where the INA Memorial Complex stands today) to enthusiastic cries of “Jai Hind” and “Netaji Zindabad”. For three months the INA carried out military administration duties at Moirang but then the Allied forces reclaimed the territory. The INA met the same fate as the Japanese, and all brigades began their withdrawal  on July  18, 1944.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The steady Japanese retreat thereafter quashed any hopes of the INA liberating the nation. The retreat continued</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">till mid-1945.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">On August 15, 1945 the surrender of Japan in the Second World War took place and with this the INA also surrendered.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">On August 18, 1945, reportedly, Subhash Bose died mysteriously in an air-crash at Taipei (Taiwan).</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">But when the INA POWs were brought back to India after the war to be court-martialled, a powerful movement emerged in their defence.</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part662.htm">Summary</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part660.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part662.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
