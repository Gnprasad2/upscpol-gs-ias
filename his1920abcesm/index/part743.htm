However, there have been watch  guards  since  time  immemorial  protecting  villages  at night. Later, under the Mughal rule there were the <i>faujdars </i>who helped in maintaining law and order, and <i>amils </i>who were basically revenue collectors but had to contend with rebels, if any. The <i>kotwal </i>was responsible for maintenance of law and order in the cities. Even during the dual rule in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa between 1765 and 1772 the zamindars were expected to maintain the staff including <i>thanedars </i>for law and order duties and for maintaining peace, as well as dealing with crime and criminals. But very often, the zamidars neglected their duties. They are even said to have colluded with  dacoits  and  shared  their  loot.  In  1770,  the  institution of the <i>faujdar </i>and <i>amils </i>were abolished. However, in 1774, Warren Hastings restored the institution of <i>faujdars </i>and asked the zamindars to assist them in suppression of dacoits, violence and disorder. In 1775, <i>faujdar thanas </i>were established in the major towns of large districts and were assisted by several smaller police stations.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">An account of steady developments in the police system under the British have been given below.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><b>1791 </b>Cornwallis organised a regular police force to maintain law and order by going back to and modernising the old  Indian  system  of <i>thanas </i>(circles) in a district under a <i>daroga </i>(an Indian) and a superintendent of police (SP) at the head of a district. He relieved the zamindars of their police duties.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><b>1808 </b>Mayo appointed an SP for each division helped by a number of spies (<i>goyendas</i>) but these spies committed depredations on local people.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><b>1814 </b>By an order of the Court of Directors, the appointment of <i>darogas </i>and their subordinates was abolished in all possessions of the Company except in Bengal.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Bentinck (governor-general, 1828-35) <span class="p">abolished the office of the SP. The collector/magistrate was now to head the police force in his jurisdiction and the commissioner in each division was to act as the SP. This arrangement resulted in a badly organised police force, putting a heavy burden on the collector/magistrate. Presidency towns were the first to have the duties of collector/magistrate separated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The recommendations of the <b>Police Commission (1860) </b>led to the Indian Police Act, 1861. The commission recommended—</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent:  9pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">a system of civil constabulary—maintaining the village set-up in the present form (a village watchman maintained by the village) but in direct relationship with the rest of the constabulary.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent:  9pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">inspector-general as the head in a province, deputy inspector-general as the head in a range, and SP as the head in a district.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The police gradually succeeded in curbing criminal acts, such as dacoity, <i>thugee, </i>etc. But, while dealing with the public, the attitude of the police was unsympathetic. The police was also used to suppress the national movement.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The British did not create an All-India Police. The Police Act, 1861 presented the guidelines for a police set- up in the provinces. The ranks were uniformly introduced all over the country.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">1902 <span class="p">The Police Commission recommended the establishment of CID (Criminal Investigation Department) in the provinces and a Central Intelligence Bureau at the Centre.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part742.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part744.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
