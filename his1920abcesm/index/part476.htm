(Tilak had, incidentally, breathed his last on August 1, 1920.)</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">September 1920 <span class="p">At a special session in Calcutta, the Congress approved a non-cooperation programme till the Punjab and Khilafat wrongs were removed and swaraj was established. The programme was to include—</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">boycott of government schools and colleges;</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">boycott of law courts and dispensation of justice through panchayats instead;</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">boycott of legislative councils; (there were some differences over this as some leaders like C.R.
