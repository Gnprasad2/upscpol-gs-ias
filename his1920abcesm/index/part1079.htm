However, most of the elections to the Lok Sabha down the years have been based on projecting a strong personality: it was Jawaharlal Nehru’s campaigning which, in the main, drew the people’s support; then Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi too were the main draws. Even Sonia Gandhi when she took over the Congress leadership and campaigned was considered to be the future prime minister, though there were rumblings about her ‘foreign origin’. In those times, however, the other parties</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">lacked a matching figure to project. The Congress now fielded Rahul Gandhi as the face of the party, who, if the party won, would be the prime minister. Manmohan Singh had clearly stated that he was not ready to be prime minister again. Rahul Gandhi had been appointed vice-president of his party in January 2013, reinforcing the perception that the party followed the dynastic path and was full of sycophants. The BJP, on the other hand, did have a more credible party structure in place: party decisions were based on discussion rather than on what a single individual said, party posts were filled through elections, and at this point of time, there were several young leaders, including state chief ministers, who could be projected as a future leader of the country. It was Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat, who was chosen as the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Rahul Gandhi, as an opponent of Narendra Modi, had little political experience, and was a lackadaisical politician lacking in the skills of an effective speaker. In his years in the Lok Sabha, he had made no noteworthy contribution. He was no match for Modi’s oratory skills and his indefatigable energy as he campaigned through the country. Even as Modi referred more than once to the dynastic nature of the Congress leadership, the lustre of the ‘First Family’ was fading, on the whole, in the public mind. Modi pushed sectarian concerns that were associated with the BJP to the back burner and made ‘development’ the plank of his campaign. The methods of campaigning adopted by the BJP were also modern; the party made wide and effective use of the social media, hiring professionals who gave striking slogans and brought the latest electioneering methods to work for the BJP. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) cadres went all out to help the BJP. Also, the BJP fought the elections as part of the NDA. It made effective alliances with the regional parties, which were part of the NDA.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The electorate was slowly but steadily changing. The public, especially the youth, had a new outlook. With growing</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">urbanisation and accompanying migration, caste equations had changed. Modi minimised appeals for votes on the basis of caste. Modi’s firm commitment to development, industrialisation, and job creation appealed to the young and inspired hope in the public.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The country went to the polls to elect the sixteenth Lok Sabha in April–May 2014. When the votes were counted, the BJP emerged with a majority on its own, with 282 seats. The Congress won just 44 seats, its worst performance in elections so far. The BJP showed remarkable success in most states; the exceptions were West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. Its vote share on all-India basis increased from about 19 per cent to about 31 per cent.</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1078.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1080.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
