They also claim that if the Congress leaders had not surrendered to power play, a different path to independence would have emerged. But actually these upsurges were an extension of earlier nationalist activity fostered by the Congress through its election campaign, its advocacy of the INA cause and highlighting of the excesses of 1942.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">These upsurges were distinguishable from the earlier activity because of their form of articulation. These were violent challenges to the authority while the earlier activity was a peaceful demonstration of national solidarity.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Congress did not officially support these upsurges because of their tactics and timing.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Negotiations had been an integral part of the Congress strategy, to be explored before a mass movement could be launched, especially when the British were seen to be preparing to leave soon.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In Gandhi’s opinion, the mutiny was badly advised: if they mutinied for India’s freedom, they were doubly wrong; if they had any grievances, they should have waited for the guidance of leaders.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part672.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part674.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
