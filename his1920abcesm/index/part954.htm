Both sides will exert all efforts to create good neighbourly</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">relations between India and Pakistan in accordance with the United Nations Charter. They reaffirm their obligation under the Charter not to have recourse to force and to settle their disputes through peaceful means. They considered that the interests of peace in their region and particularly in the Indo- Pakistan Sub-Continent and, indeed, the interests of the peoples of India and Pakistan were not served by the continuance of tension between the two countries. It was against this background that Jammu and Kashmir was discussed, and each of the sides set forth its respective position.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">2. All armed personnel of the two countries shall be withdrawn not later than 25 February, 1966 to the positions they held prior to 5 August, 1965, and both sides shall observe the cease-fire terms on the cease-fire line.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">3. Relations between India and Pakistan shall be based on the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of each other.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">4. Both sides will discourage any propaganda directed against the other country, and will encourage propaganda which promotes the development of friendly relations between the two countries.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">5. The High Commissioner of India to Pakistan and the High Commissioner of Pakistan to India will return to their posts and that the normal functioning of diplomatic missions of both countries will be restored. Both Governments shall observe the Vienna Convention of 1961 on Diplomatic Intercourse.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">6. Measures will be considered towards the restoration of economic and trade relations, communications, as well as cultural exchanges between India and Pakistan, and to take measures to implement the existing agreements between India and Pakistan.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">7. The two leaders would give instructions to their respective authorities to carry out the repatriation of the prisoners of war.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">8. Both sides will continue the discussion of questions relating to the problems of refugees and evictions/illegal immigrations. Both sides will create conditions which will prevent the exodus of people. The return of the property and assets taken over</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">by either side in connection with the conflict would be discussed.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">9. Both sides will continue meetings both at the highest and at other levels on matters of direct concern to both countries. Both sides have recognised the need to set up joint Indian- Pakistani bodies which will report to their governments in order to decide what further steps should be taken.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Source: <i>Ministry of External Affairs website</i></p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part953.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part955.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
