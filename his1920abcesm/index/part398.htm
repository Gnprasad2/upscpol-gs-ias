Student participation was visible in Bengal, Maharashtra, especially in Poona, and in many parts of the South—Guntur, Madras, Salem. Police adopted a repressive attitude towards the students. Schools and colleges whose students participated in the agitation were to be penalised by disaffiliating them or stopping of grants and privileges to them. Students who were found guilty of participation were to be disqualified for government jobs or for government scholarships, and disciplinary action—fine, expulsion, arrest, beating, etc.— was to be taken against them.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Women <span class="p">Women, who were traditionally home-centred, especially those of the urban middle classes, took active part</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">in processions and picketing. From now onwards, they were to play a significant role in the national movement.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Stand of Muslims <span class="p">Some of the Muslims participated— Barrister Abdul Rasul, Liaqat Hussain, Guznavi, Maulana Azad (who joined one of the revolutionary terrorist groups); but most of the upper and middle class Muslims stayed away or, led by Nawab Salimullah of Dacca, supported the partition on the plea that it would give them a Muslim-majority East Bengal. To further government interests, the All India Muslim League was propped up on December 30, 1905 as an anti- Congress front, and reactionary elements like Nawab Salimullah of Dacca were encouraged. Also, the nature of the Swadeshi Movement, with leaders evoking Hindu festivals and goddesses for inspiration, tended to exclude the Muslims. </span>Labour Unrest and Trade Unions <span class="p">In the beginning,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">some strikes were organised on the issue of rising prices and racial insult, primarily in the foreign owned companies. In September 1905, more than 250 Bengali clerks of the Burn Company, Howrah, walked out in protest against a derogatory work regulation. In July 1906, a strike of workers in the East Indian Railway, resulted in the formation of a Railwaymen’s Union. Between 1906 and 1908, strikes in the jute mills were very frequent, at times affecting 18 out of 18 mills. Subramania Siva and Chidambaram Pillai led strikes in Tuticorin and Tirunelveli in a foreign-owned cotton mill. In Rawalpindi (Punjab), the arsenal and railway workers went on strike led by Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh. However, by summer of 1908, the labour unrests subsided under strict action.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Thus, the social base of the movement expanded to include  certain  sections  of  the  zamindari,  the  students,  the women,  and  the  lower  middle  classes  in  cities  and  towns. An attempt was also made to give political expression to economic grievances of the working class by organising strikes. But the movement was not able to garner support of the Muslims, especially the Muslim peasantry, because of a conscious government policy of divide and rule helped by overlap of class and community at places.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part397.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part399.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
