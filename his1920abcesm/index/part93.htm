The knowledge was confined to literature, law, religion, philosophy, and logic and excluded the study of physical and natural sciences, technology and geography. In fact, due to over-reliance placed on ancient learning, any original thought got discouraged. Elementary education among the Hindus and the Muslims was quite widespread. The Hindu and Muslim elementary schools were called <i>pathshalas </i>and <i>maktabs </i>respectively. The education was confined to reading, writing, and arithmetic. Children from the lower caste sometimes attended the schools, but female presence was rare.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Chatuspathis <span class="p">or </span>Tols<span class="p">, as they were called in Bihar and</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Bengal, were the centres of higher education. Some of the famous centres for Sanskrit education were Kasi (Varanasi), Tirhut (Mithila), Nadia and Utkala. <i>Madrasahs </i>were the institutions of higher learning for Persian and Arabic, Persian being the court language and learnt by the Muslims as well as the Hindus. Azimabad (Patna) was a famous centre for Persian education. People interested in the study of the Quran and Muslim theology had to acquire proficiency in Arabic.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part92.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part94.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
