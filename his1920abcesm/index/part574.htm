The Communal Award, based on the findings of the Indian Franchise Committee (also called the Lothian Committee), established separate electorates and reserved seats for minorities, including the depressed classes which were granted seventy-eight reserved seats. Thus, this award accorded</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">separate electorates for Muslims, Europeans, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, depressed classes, and even to the Marathas for some seats in Bombay. The award was perceived by the national leaders led by the Congress as another manifestation of the British policy of divide and rule.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">It should be noted here that Dr B.R. Ambedkar in the past, in his testimony to the Simon Commission, had stressed that the depressed classes should be treated as a distinct, independent minority separate from the caste Hindus. Even, the Bengal Depressed Classes Association had lobbied for separate electorates with seats reserved according to the proportion of depressed class members to the total population as well as for adult franchise. But the Simon Commission rejected the proposal of separate electorate for the depressed classes; however, it retained the concept of reserving seats. In the second Round Table Conference held in London, Ambedkar  again  raised the  issue  of  separate electorate  for the depressed classes. Earlier in the conference, Ambedkar had attempted to compromise with Gandhi on reserved seats in a common electorate, but Gandhi, who had declared himself the sole representative of India’s oppressed masses, rejected Ambedkar’s proposal, and denounced the other delegates as unrepresentative. Further, Gandhi attempted to strike a deal with Muslims, promising to support their demands as long as the Muslims voted against separate electorates for  the  depressed classes.  It  is argued  that political considerations might have motivated Gandhi to adopt such a stand. But despite such efforts, a consensus on the minority representation could not be worked out among the Indian delegates. In the wake of such a situation, Ramsay MacDonald, who had chaired the committee on minorities, offered to mediate on the condition that the other members of the committee supported his decision. And, the outcome</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">of this mediation was the Communal Award.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part575.htm">Main Provisions of the Communal Award</a><a class="toc0" href="part576.htm">Congress Stand</a><a class="toc0" href="part577.htm">Gandhi’s Response</a><a class="toc0" href="part578.htm">Poona Pact</a><a class="toc0" href="part579.htm">Impact of Poona Pact on Dalits</a><a class="toc1" href="part580.htm">Joint Electorates and Its Impact on Depressed Classes</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part573.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part575.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
