Britain and France were once again on opposite sides.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Course of War in India <span class="p">In 1758, the French army under Count de Lally captured the English forts of St. David and Vizianagaram. Now, the English became offensive and inflicted heavy losses on the French fleet under Admiral D’Ache at Masulipatnam.</span></p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Battle of Wandiwash <span class="p">The decisive battle of the Third Carnatic War was won by the English on January 22, 1760 at Wandiwash (or Vandavasi) in Tamil Nadu. General Eyre Coote of the English totally routed the French army under Count Thomas Arthur de Lally and took Bussy as prisoner. Pondicherry was gallantly defended by Lally for eight months before he surrendered on January 16, 1761. With the loss of Jinji and Mahe, the French power in India was reduced to its lowest. Lally, after being taken as prisoner of war at London, returned to France where he was imprisoned and</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">executed in 1766.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Result and Significance </b>The Third Carnatic War proved decisive. Although the <i><b>Treaty of Peace of Paris </b></i>(1763) restored to the French their factories in India, the French political influence disappeared after the war. Thereafter, the French, like their Portuguese and Dutch counterparts in India, confined themselves to their small enclaves and to commerce. The English became the supreme European power in the Indian subcontinent, since the Dutch had already been defeated in the Battle of Bidara in 1759.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The Battle of Plassey, in 1757, is usually regarded by historians as the decisive event that brought about ultimate British rule over India. However, one cannot quite ignore the view that the true turning point for control of the subcontinent was the victory of British forces over the French forces at Wandiwash in 1760. The victory at Wandiwash left the English East India Company with no European rival in India.</p><p style="text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">View</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">While the English received supplies of food and money from Bengal, recruits of men from Europe, and grain from their northern settlements, the French could receive nothing but what came to them laboriously by land. The first were constantly strengthened, the second was constantly weakened. And this enabled Coote to establish his military superiority over Lally in the field and to hem him within the walls of Pondicherry.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">—H.H. Dodwell</p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(The Cambridge History of India, Vol V)</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Thus they were ready to take over the rule of the entire country.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Significantly, in the Battle of Wandiwash, natives served in both the armies as sepoys. It makes one think: irrespective of which side won, there was an inevitability about the fall of India to European invaders. There was a lack of sensitivity to geopolitics of the day as well as a lack of foresight on the part of native rulers.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part56.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part58.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
