Exports from Bengal to Europe consisted of raw products such as saltpetre, rice, indigo, pepper, sugar, silk, cotton textiles, handicrafts, etc. The English East India Company had vital commercial interests in trading in Bengal, as nearly 60 per cent of the British imports from Asia consisted of goods from Bengal. During the 1630s, regular contact of the British with Bengal continued when they established factories in Balasore, Hooghly, Kasimbazar, Patna and Dacca. By the 1690s, the foundation of Calcutta by the English company completed the process of English commercial settlement in Bengal. The Company paid a sum of Rs 3,000 (£ 350) per annum to the Mughal emperor who allowed them to trade freely  in  Bengal.  In  contrast,  the Company’s  exports  from Bengal were worth more than £ 50,000 per annum.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">In 1700, Murshid Quli Khan became the Dewan of Bengal and ruled till his death in 1727. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Shujauddin who ruled till 1739. After that, for a year (1739-40), Sarfaraz Khan, an incapable son of Murshid Quli Khan, became the ruler; he was killed by Alivardi Khan. Alivardi Khan ruled till 1756 and also stopped paying tributes to the Mughal emperior. Under the rule of these rulers, Bengal made unprecedented progress. There were other factors too, which made Bengal prosperous, for</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">instance, the rest of India was disturbed by inter-border disputes, the Maratha invasions, Jat revolts, and external invasions by Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Abdali. The region of Bengal was fortunate enough to escape these challenges. The population of Calcutta rose from 15,000 (in 1706) to 100,000 (in  1750)  and  other  cities like  Dacca  and Murshidabad became highly populous.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Almost all the governors of Bengal strongly resented the special privileges enjoyed by the English company as it meant a huge loss to the provincial exchequer. So the friction between the English commercial interests and the Bengal government became the chief cause for conflict between the two. During a short period between 1757 and 1765, the power gradually got transferred from the Nawabs of Bengal to the British with the latter defeating the former.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part109.htm">Alivardi Khan and the English</a><a class="toc0" href="part110.htm">Challenges Before Siraj-ud-daula</a><a class="toc0" href="part111.htm">The Battle of Plassey</a><a class="toc1" href="part112.htm">Prelude to the Battle</a><a class="toc1" href="part113.htm">The Battle</a><a class="toc1" href="part114.htm">Significance of Battle of Plassey</a><a class="toc0" href="part115.htm">Mir Kasim and the Treaty of 1760</a><a class="toc1" href="part116.htm">Steps taken by Mir Kasim</a><a class="toc0" href="part117.htm">The Battle of Buxar</a><a class="toc1" href="part118.htm">Prelude to Battle</a><a class="toc1" href="part119.htm">The Battle</a><a class="toc0" href="part120.htm">The Treaty of Allahabad</a><a class="toc0" href="part121.htm">Dual Government in Bengal (1765-72)</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part107.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part109.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
