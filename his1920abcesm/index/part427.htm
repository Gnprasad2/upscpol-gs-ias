Having failed at the 1914 session of the Congress to reach a Moderate-Extremist rapprochement, Tilak and Besant decided to revive political activity on their own.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">By early 1915, Annie Besant had launched a campaign to demand self-government for India after the war on the lines of white colonies. She campaigned through her newspapers, <i>New India </i>and <i>Commonweal, </i>and through public meetings and conferences. At the annual session of the Congress in 1915, the efforts of Tilak and Besant met with some success. It was decided that the Extremists be admitted to the Congress. Although Besant failed to get the Congress to approve  her  scheme  of  Home  Rule  Leagues,  the  Congress did commit itself to a programme of educative propaganda and to a revival of local-level Congress committees. Not willing to wait for too long, Besant laid the condition that if the Congress did not implement its commitments, she would be free to set up her own league—which she finally had to, as there was no response from the Congress.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Tilak and Besant set up their separate leagues to avoid any friction. As Annie Besant said, some supporters of Tilak were not at ease with her and similarly, some of her own supporters were not at ease with Tilak. However, both leagues coordinated their efforts by confining their work to their specific areas. They cooperated where they could.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part428.htm">Tilak’s League</a><a class="toc0" href="part429.htm">Besant’s League</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part426.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part428.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
