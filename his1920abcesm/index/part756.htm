The Company’s limitations in administering the country in complex situations had been exposed by the revolt of 1857; besides, there was not much accountability. Now, the power to govern was to be wielded through a secretary of state (earlier this power was exercised by Directors of the Company and the Board of Control). The secretary of state was to be a member of the British cabinet, and was to be assisted by a council of 15. He was answerable to the British Parliament. All initiatives and final decisions rested with the secretary and the council was only advisory in nature. (Thus the dual system introduced by Pitt’s India Act, 1784 came to an end.) Also, the ultimate power over India remained with Parliament.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Government in India was to be carried on, as before, by the governor-general whose prestige, if not authority, increased with the new title of viceroy given to him. The viceroy was to be assisted by an executive council whose members were to act as the heads of various departments, as well as viceroy’s official advisors.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The concentration of the main authority in the hands of the secretary of state based in London, on the one hand, gradually reduced the viceroy to a subordinate status and further alienated the Indian public opinion from the government policy-making. On the other hand, it had the effect of increasing the influence of British industrialists, merchants and bankers over government policy in India. This made the Indian administration even more reactionary than it had been before 1858.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">By the <b>Indian Councils Act, 1861</b>, a fifth member, who was to be a jurist, was added to viceroy’s executive</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">council. For legislative purposes, the viceroy could add six to twelve additional members, of whom at least half had to be non-officials who could be either Indian or English. The legislative council so constituted possessed no real powers and was merely advisory in nature. Its weaknesses were as follows—</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">It could not discuss important matters, and no</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">financial matters at all without previous approval of the Government.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">It had no control over the budget.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">It could not discuss executive action.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">Final passing of the bill needed the viceroy’s approval.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">Even if approved by the viceroy, the secretary of state could disallow a legislation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s16">● </span>Indians associated as non-officials were members of elite sections only—princes, landlords, <i>diwans, </i>etc.—and were not representative of the Indian opinion.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">The viceroy could issue ordinances (of 6 months validity) in case of emergency.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The only important function of the legislative council was to endorse official measures and give them the appearance of having been passed by a legislative body. The British Government in India remained, as before, an alien despotism.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part755.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part757.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
