They did not succeed in their efforts, but they influenced the future course of political events in their respective regions. Their continuous struggle against the empire for political ascendancy weakened the empire considerably. Aurangzeb, and after him Bahadur Shah I, by attempting to suppress the Rajputs, spurred them to battle against the Mughals. The later Mughals made an effort to follow a policy of reconciliation with the Rajputs, but by then it was already too late: the Rajputs no longer trusted the Mughals enough</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">to ally with them for the welfare of the empire.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s18" style=" background-color: antiquewhite;">        Causes of the Mughals’ Downfall in a Nutshell        </span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Some of the main causes for the decline of the Mughals, briefly put, were as follows:</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(i) The government of the Mughals was a personal despotism and so its success depended on the character of the reigning ruler. The later Mughals were worthless and neglected the administration of the state.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) With the absence of a definite law of succession, there always occurred a war of succession; this weakened the stability of the government, and fostered partisanship at the cost of patriotism.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) The degeneration of the rulers led to the degeneration of the nobility, with factious quarrels and intrigues costing the empire heavily.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) The deterioration of the army also proved disastrous for the empire.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(v) The empire had become too vast and unwieldy to be efficiently governed from a central authority under weak rulers, especially under the existing conditions of transport and communication.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(vi) Aurangzeb’s religious policy was largely responsible, leading to revolts by Rajputs, Sikhs, Jats and Marathas.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(vii) Aurangzeb’s Deccan policy was a complete failure and was an important cause of the downfall of the Mughal empire.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(viii) Invasions of Irani and Durrani kingdoms gave a death-blow to the Mughal empire.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The Marathas too were becoming a formidable enemy. Their aim was at first limited only to regaining control over the region of Maharashtra; but it soon went on to include getting legal sanction from the Mughal emperor for collecting <i>sardeshmukhi </i>and <i>chauth </i>throughout India. They forged northwards and, by 1740, succeeded in spreading their influence over the provinces of Gujarat, Malwa and Bundelkhand. The Rajput struggle against the empire and the growing ambition and power of the Marathas, thus, adversely affected the Mughal might.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part75.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part77.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
