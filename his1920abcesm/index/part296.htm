He put his faith in monotheism. He wrote <i>Gift to Monotheists </i>(1809) and translated into Bengali the <i>Vedas </i>and the five <i>Upanishads </i>to prove his conviction that ancient Hindu texts support monotheism.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In 1814, he set up the <b>Atmiya Sabha </b>(or Society of Friends) in Calcutta to propagate the monotheistic ideals of the Vedanta and to campaign against idolatry, caste rigidities, meaningless rituals and other social ills. Strongly influenced by rationalist ideas, he declared that <i>Vedanta </i>is based on reason and that, if reason demanded it, even a departure from the scriptures is justified.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">206</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">He said the principles of rationalism applied to other sects also, particularly to the elements of blind faith in them. In his <i>Precepts of Jesus </i>(1820), he tried to separate the moral and philosophical message of the New Testament, which he praised, from its miracle stories. He earned the wrath of missionaries over his advocacy to incorporate the message of Christ into Hinduism.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">He stood for a creative and intellectual process of selecting the best from different cultures, over which, again, he faced orthodox reaction.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Raja Rammohan Roy founded the <b>Brahmo Sabha </b>in August 1828; it was later renamed <b>Brahmo Samaj</b>. Through the Sabha he wanted to institutionalise his ideas and mission. The Samaj was committed to “the worship and adoration of the Eternal, Unsearchable, Immutable Being who is the Author and Preserver of the Universe”. Prayers, meditation and readings of the <i>Upanishads </i>were to be the forms of worship and no graven image, statue or sculpture, carving, painting, picture, portrait, etc., were to be allowed in the Samaj buildings, thus underlining the Samaj’s opposition to idolatry and meaningless rituals. The long-term agenda of the Brahmo Samaj—to purify Hinduism and to preach monotheism—was  based  on  the  twin  pillars  of  reason  and the <i>Vedas </i>and <i>Upanishads. </i>The Samaj also tried to incorporate teachings of other religions and kept its emphasis on human dignity, opposition to idolatry and criticism of social evils such as <i>sati</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Rammohan Roy did not want to establish a new religion. He only wanted to purify Hinduism of the evil practices which had crept into it. Roy’s progressive ideas met with strong opposition from orthodox elements like Raja Radhakant Deb who organised the Dharma Sabha to counter Brahmo Samaj propaganda. Roy’s death in 1833 was a setback for the Samaj’s mission.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">View</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Raja Rammohan Roy and his Brahmo Samaj form the starting point for all the various reform movements—whether in Hindu religion, society or politics—which have agitated modern India.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 176pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">—<b>H.C.E. Zacharias</b></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The features of Brahmo Samaj may be summed thus—</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">it denounced polytheism and idol worship;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s20">● </span>it discarded faith in divine <i>avataras </i>(incarnations)<i>;</i></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">it denied that any scripture could enjoy the status of ultimate authority transcending human reason and conscience;</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s20">● </span>it took no definite stand on the doctrine of <i>karma </i>and transmigration of soul and left it to individual Brahmos to believe either way;</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">● <span class="p">it criticised the caste system.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">His ideas and activities were also aimed at political uplift of the masses through social reform and, to that extent, can be said to have had nationalist undertones.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;"><b>Raja Rammohan Roy’s Efforts at Social Reform </b>Rammohan was a determined crusader against the inhuman practice of <i>sati</i>. He started his anti-sati struggle in 1818 and he cited sacred texts to prove his contention that no religion sanctioned the burning alive of widows, besides appealing to humanity, reason and compassion. He also visited the cremation grounds, organised vigilance groups and filed counter petitions to the government during his struggle against <i>sati</i>. His efforts were rewarded by the Government Regulation in 1829 which declared the practice of <i>sati </i>a crime.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">As a campaigner for women’s rights, Roy condemned the general subjugation of women and opposed prevailing misconceptions which formed the basis of according an inferior social status to women. Roy attacked polygamy and the degraded state of widows and demanded the right of inheritance and property for women.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Rammohan Roy did much to disseminate the benefits of modern education to his countrymen. He supported David Hare’s efforts to found the Hindu College in 1817, while Roy’s English school taught mechanics and Voltaire’s philosophy. In 1825, he established a Vedanta college where courses in both Indian learning and Western social and physical sciences were offered. He also helped enrich the Bengali language by compiling a Bengali grammar book and evolving a modern elegant prose style.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part295.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part297.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
