European supremacy was assured in the civil service as in other spheres of governance. This was done in mainly two ways.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Firstly, although Indians had begun to enter the coveted ranks of the Indian Civil Services (ICS) ever since 1863, entering the civil services was still extremely difficult for the Indians. The entrance examination for the ICS was held</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">in London in English medium only, and the subjects included classical Greek and Latin learning. Moreover, the maximum age for appearing at the examination was reduced from twenty-three in 1859 to nineteen in 1878 under Lytton.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Secondly, all key positions of power and authority and those which were well-paid were occupied by the Europeans. Though a slow process of Indianisation occurred after</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">1918 under nationalist pressure, important and senior positions continued to be occupied by Europeans. But gradually, the Indians came to realise that Indianisation of civil service had not, in any way, transferred effective power into Indian hands. The Indian members of the civil service continued to serve the imperialist interests of their British masters.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part741.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part743.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
