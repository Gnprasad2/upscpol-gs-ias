They controlled a large portion of the country; besides, they also received tributes from areas not directly under their control. By the middle of the eighteenth century, they were in Lahore thinking of becoming rulers of the north Indian empire and in the court of the Mughals playing the role of kingmakers.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Though the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), in which they were defeated by Ahmad Shah Abdali, changed the situation, they regrouped, regained their strength and within a decade achieved a position of power in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Bajirao I (1720-40), considered greatest of all the Peshwas, had started a confederacy of prominent Maratha chiefs to manage the rapidly expanding Maratha power, and to some extent appease the kshatriya section of the Marathas (Peshwas were brahmins) led by the <i>senapati </i>Dabodi. Under the arrangement of the Maratha confederacy, each prominent family under a chief was assigned a sphere of influence which he was supposed to conquer and rule, but in the name of the then Maratha king, Shahu. The Maratha families which emerged prominent were—(i) the Gaekwad of Baroda,</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(ii) the Bhonsle of Nagpur, (iii) the Holkars of Indore,</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">(iv) the Sindhias of Gwalior, and (v) the Peshwa of Poona. The confederacy, under Bajirao I to Madhavrao I worked cordially but the Third Battle of Panipat (1761) changed everything. The defeat at Panipat and later the death of the young Peshwa, Madhavrao I, in 1772, weakened the control of the Peshwas over the confederacy. Though the chiefs of the confederacy united on occasion, as against the British (1775-82), more often they quarrelled among themselves.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">Entry of the English into Maratha Politics <span class="p">The years between the last quarter of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century witnessed the Marathas</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align: justify;">and the English clashing thrice for political supremacy, with the English emerging victorious in the end. The cause of these conflicts was the inordinate ambition of the English, and the divided house of the Marathas that encouraged the English to hope for success in their venture. The English in Bombay wanted to establish a government on the lines of the arrangement made by Clive in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. So it was a longed-for opportunity for the English when dissensions over a succession divided the Marathas.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part139.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part141.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
