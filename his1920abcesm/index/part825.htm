It recommended—</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">1. pre-primary education for 3-6 years age group; free,</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent:  3pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s15" style=" background-color: #6D6E70;">      Wardha Scheme of Basic Education (1937)      </span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The Congress had organised a National Conference on Education in October 1937 in Wardha. In the light of the resolutions passed there,  <b>Zakir Hussain committee </b>formulated a detailed national scheme for basic education. The main principle behind this scheme was ‘learning through activity’. It was based on Gandhi’s ideas published in a series of articles in the weekly <i>Harijan</i>. Gandhi thought that Western education had created a gulf between the educated few and the masses and had also made the educated elite ineffective. The scheme had the following provisions.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) Inclusion of a basic handicraft in the syllabus.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) First seven years of schooling to be an integral part of a free and compulsory nationwide education system (through mother tongue).</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) Teaching to be in Hindi from class II to VII and in English only after class VIII.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) Ways to be devised to establish contact with the community around schools through service.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(v) A suitable technique to be devised with a view to implementing the main idea of basic education—educating the child through the medium of productive activity of a suitable handicraft. The system, rather than being a methodology for education, was an expression of an idea for a new life and a new society. The basic premise was that only through such a scheme could India be an independent and non-violent society. This scheme</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">was child-centred and cooperative.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">There was not much development of this idea, because of the start of the Second World War and the resignation of the Congress ministries (October 1939).</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">universal and compulsory elementary education for 6-11 years age group; high school education for 11-</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">17 years age group for selected children, and a university course of 3 years after higher secondary; high schools to be of two types: (i) academic and</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">(ii) technical and vocational.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">2. adequate technical, commercial and arts education.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">3. abolition of intermediate course.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">4. liquidation of adult illiteracy in 20 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;padding-left: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">5. stress on teachers’ training, physical education, education for the physically and mentally handicapped.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">The objective was to create within 40 years, the same level of educational attainment as prevailed in England. Although a bold and comprehensive scheme, it proposed no methodology for implementation. Also, the ideal of England’s achievements may not have suited Indian conditions.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part824.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part826.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
