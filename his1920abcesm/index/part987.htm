Also, the number of seats to the National Assembly was to be in proportion to the population. East Pakistan, the more populous of the two wings of</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Pakistan, was thus, naturally, allotted more seats than West Pakistan.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">In West Pakistan, the dominant party was the Pakistan People’s  Party  (PPP)  led by  Zulfiqar Ali  Bhutto,  while in East Pakistan the Awami League led by Mujibur Rahman was the dominant party. Mujibur Rahman spoke of the eastern wing being  repressed  by  the  military rulers  and  treated  as a colony to cater to West Pakistan’s interests. The East Pakistanis resented their language—Bengali—being side lined and the low representation of their people in the higher administrative sections of the country. Mujibur Rahman demanded greater autonomy and a true federal constitution with greater powers for the East wing. The poll was held in December 1970 and the results showed where Pakistan was heading. While the PPP won a majority of seats in West Pakistan, the Awami League simply swept the elections in East Pakistan and, in the process, got a majority over all.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 20pt;  text-align: justify;">Yahya Khan did not like the prospect of an assembly led by an East Pakistani and dominated by East Pakistanis with their demand for autonomy in framing a new democratic constitution. There was also a fear among the West Pakistan rulers that the Hindus in East Pakistan, many of whom were well-educated professionals, might influence the writing of the  constitution.  Yahya  Khan  with  the  endorsement  of Zulfiqar Bhutto postponed convening the National Assembly. This angered the East Pakistanis, and the call for a general strike by the Awami League met with a good response. In March 1971, the Pakistani military regime took steps to crush the protest and sent tanks and forces into East Pakistan. Mujibur Rahman was arrested and moved to an unknown destination. There seemed little chance for reconciliation after the violent clashes and the brutal killing of civilians, especially students, by the Pakistani army.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part986.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part988.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
