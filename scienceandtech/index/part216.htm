There are three mechanisms by which horizontal gene transfer can take place: conjugation, transformation and transduction.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5"> </span>Bacteria contain a DNA entity called the ‘plasmid’. Plasmids are circular DNA strands capable of replication independent of the chromosomal DNA. <b>A unique property of plasmids is that copies of replicated DNA can be transferred from one bacterium to another, sometimes even across the species. </b>Known as <b>conjugation</b>, this process is akin to mating in higher organisms. When two bacteria come close to each other, a hollow bridge-like structure called the ‘pilus’ forms between them to facilitate a copy of the plasmid to move from one to another. Plasmids may contain genes that render the bacteria resistant to specific antibiotics. In such a case,the recipient bacteria also become resistant to that antibiotic.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5"> </span>Another means by which bacteria can acquire a readymade resistance gene is a process called ‘<b>transformation*</b>’. When a cell dies, it breaks apart and releases its DNA to the surrounding environment. Bacteria may scavenge these free-floating DNA pieces and incorporate them into their own chromosomes. If the DNA contained an antibiotic resistance gene, the recipient bacteria too can begin to exhibit that property.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5"> </span>A virus may also act as a vehicle for horizontal transfer of genes. Some  viruses known as ‘<b>bacteriophages*</b>’ (or simply ‘phages’) are specific to bacteria. When a phage infects a bacterium, it takes over the host biochemical machinery to reproduce itself, ultimately destroying the host. This is known as the lytic phase in the life cycle of the virus.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s5"> </span><span class="p">During this process, known as transformation, the virus may inadvertently incorporate some bacterial genes in to its own genome. Upon the death of the bacterium, the phages infect other bacteria. From the lytic phase the virus enters the lysogenic phase of its life cycle; here the virus will not reproduce in the bacterial cell but integrate its genome with the bacterial genome and replicate along with it. Such bacteria continue to surviveand reproduce, expressing even the viral genes. If the viral genome contained a drug resistance gene, the host bacterium will display resistance to the drug.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_087.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The response</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5"> </span>One of the fertile targets is the SOS repair pathway as <b>preventing the induction of SOS repair </b>reduces formation of drug resistance not only through chromosomal mutations, but also other mechanisms like horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s5"> </span><span class="p">However, some researchers feel that such attempts may only extend the time needed for resistance development and will not eliminate the problem completely.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s5"> </span><span class="p">This is because antibiotic antibiotics.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">resistance is an unavoidable consequence</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the indiscriminate use of</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5"> </span>According to the Food and Drug Administration of the USA, drug resistance “is an outcome of natural selection and should be viewed as an expected phenomenon of the <b>Darwinian biological principle of ‘Survival of the fittest </b>’”.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4"></span><span class="s5"> </span>As long as the effectiveness of the drug is based on chemical processes, bugs can always develop resistance to the process.
