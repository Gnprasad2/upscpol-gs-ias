Goa&#39;s Liberation</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The prolonged rule of British Empire came to an end in 1947. However, the Portugal refused to withdraw from the territories of Goa, Diu and Daman, which they ruled since 16the Century. The people of Goa were suppressed by Portuguese misrule and they were denied of basic civil rights to them, Portuguese carried out coerced religious conversions as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Initially, the Government of India, tried to convince the Portuguese to vacate these territories and consider the popular movements of local people. The Situation became worse in <b>1955 </b>when a group Goan and Indian protesters staging a liberation march were shot at and killed by the Portuguese. Nehru government responded by instituting a <b>blockade </b>around Goa, however this was bypassed by the Portuguese by adopting the air route to open trade with Pakistan and Srilanka. Eventually on <b>18 December 1961</b>, under <b>operation Vijay</b>, the Indian troops crossed the border into Goa and after two days of action the Portuguese surrendered on <b>19 December</b></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After this liberation, another thorny issue emerged in Goa. The <b>Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party [MGP] </b>desired that <b>Goa should be merged with Maharashtra</b>.</p>  <p  style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another faction <span class="p">of Goans </span>wanted to retain their separate identity &amp; their culture <span class="p">essentially their </span>Konkani language<span class="p">. The faction got their support from </span>United Goan Party (UGP)<span class="p">. In </span>1967<span class="p">, Government of India initiated a move to resolve this issue. It undertook an </span>&quot;Opinion Poll&quot; <span class="p">in Goa whether it should be merged with Maharashtra or remains separate. This was the </span>only occasion where this kind of referendum like process <span class="p">was undertaken to ascertain peopleâ€™s desire on a particular subject. The overwhelming </span>majority of the people favored Goa to remain, separate  from Maharashtra<span class="p">. For a  longer time, </span>Goa  remained a Union Territory<span class="p">. Finally Goa became a state of the Indian Union in </span>1987<span class="p">.</span> </p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part115.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part117.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
