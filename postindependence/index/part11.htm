Integration of Princely States</h2><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unifying post partition India and the princely states under one administration was perhaps the most important task faced by then political leadership. In colonial India, <b>nearly 40% of the territory was occupied by five hundred sixty five small and large states ruled by princes </b>who enjoyed varying degrees of autonomy under the system of British Paramountcy. British power protected them from their own people as also from external aggression so long as they did British bidding.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As the British left, <b>many of 565 princely states, began to dream of independence</b>. They had <b>claimed that the paramountcy could not be transferred </b>to the new states of India and Pakistan. The ambitions were fuelled by the then British PM <b>Clement Attlee announcement on Feb 20, 1947 </b>that &quot;<b>His Majesty&#39;s Government does not intend to hand over their powers and obligations under paramountcy to any government of British India&quot;.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With great skill and <b>masterful diplomacy </b>and using both <b>persuasion </b>and <b>pressure</b>, <b>Sardar Patel </b>succeeded in integrating the hundreds of princely  states.  <b>Few princely states joined Constituent Assembly with wisdom &amp; realism</b>, but other princely states still stayed away from joining it. Princely states of <b>Travancore</b>, <b>Bhopal</b>, and <b>Hyderabad </b>publicly announced their desire to <b>claim an independent status.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On <b>June 27, 1947</b>, Sardar Patel assumed additional charge of the newly created <b>states department </b>with V.P. Menon as its <b>Secretary</b>.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>government&#39;s approach </b>was guided by <b>three considerations</b>:</p>  <p  style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. <span class="p">The </span>people <span class="p">of most of the princely states clearly wanted to become part of the Indian Union.</span> </p>  <p  style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. <span class="p">The government was prepared to be flexible in giving </span>autonomy to some regions<span class="p">. The idea was to </span>accommodate plurality &amp; adopt a flexible approach <span class="p">in dealing with the demands of the regions.</span> </p>  <p  style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. <span class="p">In the </span>back drop of Partition<span class="p">, the </span>integration and consolidation <span class="p">of the territorial boundaries of the nation had </span>assumed supreme importance<span class="p">.</span> </p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Patel threw a <b>series of lunch parties </b>where he requested his princely guests to help the Congress in framing the new constitution for India. <b>Patel&#39;s first step </b>was to <b>appeal to the princes </b>whose territories fell inside India to accede to the Indian Union <b>in three subjects </b>which affected the common interests of the country, namely, <b>foreign relations, defence and communications. </b>He also gave an <b>implied threat </b>he would not be able to restrain the impatient people post August 15, 1947. States were issued an <b>appeal with an implied threat of anarchy </b>and chaos.</p>  <p  style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Next step of Patel <span class="p">was to </span>convince Mountbatten <span class="p">to bat for India. </span>25th July speech of Mountbatten <span class="p">to the </span>Chamber of Princes <span class="p">finally persuaded the Princes. This speech ranked as the </span>most significant Act of Mountbatten <span class="p">in India. After this, virtually </span>all the states except 3 signed the instrument of accession<span class="p">.</span> </p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One was <b>Travancore </b>under the Maharaja of Travancore <b>Chithira Thirunal </b>but the real ruler was its <b>Diwan C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyyer</b>. There was an attack on C. P. Aiyyar, and after that it was Maharaja of Travancore which wired the government that they are ready for accession.</p>  <p  style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Jodhpur-<span class="p">, itâ€™s accession was a serious issue due to its proximity to border. The young king was also being wooed by but after tremendous pressure from Patel, finally he signed the Instrument of accession to India.</span> </p>  <p  style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Bhopal- <span class="p">Mainly hindu population and </span>ruler was Habibullah Khan <span class="p">supported by Jinnah. There was a </span>revolt against the Bhopal ruler<span class="p">, he faced pressure from Patel and common population and finally he signed the Instrument of Accession.</span> </p>  <p  style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Thus before August 15, 1947 peaceful negotiations has brought almost all states whose territories were contiguous to the new boundaries of India, into the Indian Union<span class="p">. The rulers of most of the states signed a document called the </span>&quot;Instrument of Accession&quot; <span class="p">which meant that their state agreed to become a part of the Union of India.</span> </p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Accession of the princely states of <b>Junagadh</b>, <b>Hyderabad</b>, <b>Kashmir </b>and <b>Manipur proved </b>more</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part12.htm">difficult than the rest.</a><a class="toc0" href="part13.htm">On 1 January 1948 India decided to take the Kashmir issue to UN:</a><a class="toc0" href="part14.htm">Other States:</a><a class="toc0" href="part15.htm">French and Portuguese settlements:</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part10.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part12.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
