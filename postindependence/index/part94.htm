But contrary to this apprehension, India quite well managed to accommodate and even celebrate India&#39;s cultural diversity.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>linguistic reorganization </b>of India and the <b>resolution of the official language controversy </b>have played a very important role by eliminating a patent cause of the feeling of cultural loss or cultural domination. Despite such great amount of amity and peace, <b>there exist many regional disputes </b>which create friction between regional states like on <b>sharing of river waters </b>between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, Karnataka &amp; Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh etc.</p><h3 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Economic Imbalances &amp; Regionalism:</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Economic inequality among different states and region could be a potential source of trouble. Hence from the beginning, the <b>national government felt a responsibility to counter the imbalance in regional development</b>. To influence the rates of growth in poorer states and regions and to reduce economic distance from richer states, the central <b>government adopted a whole range of policies</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">♤  </span><span class="s2"> </span>A major instrument in government&#39;s hand in bringing development to the poor state was <b>transfer of financial resources</b>, which was done by <b>Finance Commission</b>, a constitutional body.</p>  <p  style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">♤  </span><span class="s2"> </span>Planning <span class="p">was also used as a </span>powerful instrument to remove regional inequality<span class="p">.
