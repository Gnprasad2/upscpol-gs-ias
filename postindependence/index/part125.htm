People were unhappy with corruption and lavish lifestyle of party members. According to <b>Zareer Masani</b>, a freelance journalist and broadcaster, due to the continuous power struggle within and rapid erosion of party discipline, confidence was built up in the anti-Congress wave during 1967 elections.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An important feature of the <b>1967 elections </b>was the <b>coming together of the opposition parties</b>. The 1967 elections also initiated the dual era of short lived coalition governments and politics of defection. Coalition governments were formed in all opposition ruled states except Tamil Nadu. Congress too formed coalition governments in some of the states. 1967 elections also heralded politics of coalition. In Haryana where the defection phenomenon was first initiated, and new term was coined <b>&quot;Aya Ram Gaya Ram&quot; </b>for the leaders frequently changing their party. During 1967 to 1970 nearly 800 assembly members crossed the floor, and 155 of them were rewarded with ministerial offices.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The 1967 elections, also dramatically changed the balance of power within the Congress Party. <b>Syndicate</b>, the powerful group, of the party received major blow as several stalwarts lost the elections.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part124.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part126.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
