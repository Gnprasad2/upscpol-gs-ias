The ruling party of Zulfikar Bhutto emerged as winner in West Pakistan while in their Eastern Part Sheikh Mujib-Ur Rahman&#39;s Awani League won majority of seats with great margins. However, strong and powerful western establishment ignored the democratic verdict and didn&#39;t accept the League&#39;s demand for federation. Instead of responding to their demands and verdict positively, Pakistan army arrested Rahman and unleashed brutal terror activities and suppressed their voices. To end this menace permanently, <b>people of Eastern Pakistan started liberation struggle of Bangladesh from Pakistan</b>. Due to the <b>huge influx of refugees from Eastern Pakistan</b>, India deliberated much and later extended its support to people&#39;s cause materially and morally, which was frowned by Western Pakistan as Indian conspiracy to break of Pakistan.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The support to Western Pakistan came from the USA &amp; China to quash the people&#39;s movement. To ensure its safety from the attacks of American and Chinese backed Pak, <b>India signed 20 year Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Soviet Union</b>. Even after much diplomatic deliberations it could not achieve concrete results, and <b>full scale war broke out in December 1971 </b>on both the western and Eastern front. With the support of local population in the form of <b>&quot;Mukti Bahini&quot; </b>Indian army made rapid progress and compelled the <b>Pakistani troops to surrender in 10 days only</b>. With emergence of Bangladesh as an independent country, India declared a unilateral ceasefire. Later <b>Shimla Agreement of 1972 between Indira Gandhi &amp; Zulfikar </b>Bhutto brought back the peace between two nations. Since then India has argued for Shimla agreement as the framework within which the disputes between the two countries should be resolved.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part68.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part70.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
