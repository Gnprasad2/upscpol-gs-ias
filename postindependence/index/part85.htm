Lessons from Emergency</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 1975, the then PM Indira Gandhi had declared emergency, on the grounds of threat to internal stability. Due to the abuse of power during the period of emergency, it was realised that such measures subvert the rule of law and democratic institutions. Therefore post emergency, there emerged a political consensus that ensured that such declaration of emergency, did not happen again</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The end of emergency was marked by the announcement of Mrs. Gandhi on 18 January 1977 that elections to the Lok Sabha would be held in March. Results of the elections held on 16 March made clear that the electorate had not taken a kind view of the developments during the emergence and as a result Congress party was thoroughly defeated, this also included loss of Mrs Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi in their respective constituencies. Normalcy soon resumed in India after the end of emergency. Many observers found many weakness and strengths emerged out of this period.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">♤  </span><span class="s2"> </span>First lesson is that it is <b>extremely difficult to do away with democracy in India</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p class="s1" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">The ambiguities regarding the emergency provisions were rectified during the Janata Government as it was made clear in the the constitution that &quot;Internal Emergency&quot; can be proclaimed only on the grounds of &quot;armed rebellion&quot; and it is now necessary for the council of Minister to advice President in writing to proclaim emergency.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s2"> </span><span class="p">Emergency made everyone aware of the value of civil liberties.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The lifting of emergency and the free elections that followed were a defining moment in India’s post-independence history. This chapter in Indian history revealed the underlying attachment of Indian people to democratic values evolved over the years through the experience of freedom struggle as well as conduct of free elections in independent India.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part84.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part86.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
