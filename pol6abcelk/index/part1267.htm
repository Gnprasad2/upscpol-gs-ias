On Electoral Processes</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. Any person charged with any offence punishable with imprisonment for a maximum term of five years or more, should be disqualified for being chosen as or for being a member of Parliament or Legislature of a State.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. Any person convicted for any heinous crime like murder, rape, smuggling, dacoity, etc., should be permanently debarred from contesting for any political office.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. Criminal cases against politicians pending before Courts either for trial or in appeal must be disposed of speedily, if necessary, by appointing Special Courts.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. The election petitions should also be decided by special courts. In the alternative, special election benches may be constituted in the High Courts and earmarked exclusively for the disposal of election petitions and election disputes.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. Any system of State funding of elections bears a close nexus to the regulation of working of political parties by law and to the creation of a foolproof mechanism under law with a view to implementing the financial limits strictly. Therefore, proposals for State funding should be deferred till these regulatory mechanisms are firmly in position.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. Candidates should not be allowed to contest election simultaneously for the same office from more than one constituency.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">7. The election code of conduct should be given the sanctity of law and its violation should attract penal action.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">8. The Commission while recognizing the beneficial potential of the system of run off contest electing the representative winning on the basis of 50 per cent plus one vote polled, as</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">against the present first-past-the-post system, for a more representative democracy, recommends that the Government and the Election Commission of India should examine this issue of prescribing a minimum of 50 per cent plus one vote for election in all its aspects.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">9. An independent candidate who loses election three times consecutively should be permanently debarred from contesting election to the same office.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">10. The minimum number of valid votes polled should be increased to 25 per cent from the current 16.67 per cent as a condition for the deposit not being forfeited.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1271.htm#bookmark3019" class="s85" name="bookmark3006">11.

The Chief Election Commissioner and the other Election Commissioners should be appointed on the recommendation of a body consisting of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Similar procedure should be adopted in the case of appointment of State Election Commissioners.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part1266.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1268.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
