Hence, a fresh proclamation was not needed at the time of war against Pakistan in 1965.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The second proclamation of national emergency was made in December 1971 in the wake of attack by Pakistan. Even when this</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Emergency was in operation, a third proclamation of National Emergency was made in June 1975. Both the second and third proclamations were revoked in March 1977.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The first two proclamations (1962 and 1971) were made on the ground of &#39;external aggression’, while the third proclamation (1975) was made on the ground of &#39;internal disturbance’, that is, certain persons have been inciting the police and the armed forces against the discharge of their duties and their normal functioning.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Emergency declared in 1975 (internal emergency) proved to be the most controversial. There was widespread criticism of the misuse of Emergency powers. In the elections held to the Lok Sabha in 1977 after the Emergency, the Congress Party led by Indira Gandhi lost and the Janta Party came to power. This government appointed the Shah Commission to investigate the circumstances that warranted the declaration of an Emergency in 1975. The commission did not justify the declaration of the Emergency. Hence, the 44th Amendment Act was enacted in 1978 to introduce a number of safeguards against the misuse of Emergency provisions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part363.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part365.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
