Part VI of the Constitution deals with the government in the states.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Articles 153 to 167 in Part VI of the Constitution deal with the state executive. The state executive consists of the governor, the chief minister, the council of ministers and the advocate general of the state. Thus, there is no office of vice-governor (in the state) like that of Vice-President at the Centre.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The governor is the chief executive head of the state. But, like the president, he is a nominal executive head (titular or constitutional head). The governor also acts as an agent of the central government. Therefore, the office of governor has a dual role.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Usually, there is a governor for each state, but the 7th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1956 facilitated the appointment of the same person as a governor for two or more states.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="search-table-outter wrapper">

He is appointed by the president by warrant under his hand and seal. In a way, he is a nominee of the Central government. But, as held by the Supreme Court in 1979, the office of governor of a state is not an employment under the Central government. It is an independent constitutional office and is not under the control of or subordinate to the Central government.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part740.htm#bookmark1488" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;" name="bookmark1471">The Draft Constitution provided for the direct election of the governor on the basis of universal adult suffrage. But the Constituent Assembly opted for the present system of appointment of governor by the president because of the following reasons</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 4pt;">1 </span>:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">1. The direct election of the governor is incompatible with the parliamentary system established in the states.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">2. The mode of direct election is more likely to create conflicts between the governor and the chief minister.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">3. The governor being only a constitutional (nominal) head, there is no point in making elaborate arrangements for his election and spending huge amount of money.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">4. The election of a governor would be entirely on personal issues. Hence, it is not in the national interest to involve a large number of voters in such an election.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">5. An elected governor would naturally belong to a party and would not be a neutral person and an impartial head.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">6. The election of governor would create separatist tendencies and thus affect the political stability and unity of the country.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">7. The system of presidential nomination enables the Centre to maintain its control over the states.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">8. The direct election of the governor creates a serious problem of leadership at the time of a general election in the state.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">9. The chief minister would like his nominee to contest for governorship. Hence, a second rate man of the ruling party is elected as governor.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Therefore, the American model, where the Governor of a state is directly elected, was dropped and the Canadian model, where the governor of a province (state) is appointed by the Governor-General (Centre), was accepted in the Constituent Assembly.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution lays down only two qualifications for the appointment of a person as a governor. These are:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. He should be a citizen of India.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. He should have completed the age of 35 years.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Additionally, two conventions have also developed in this regard over the years. First, he should be an outsider, that is, he should not belong to the state where he is appointed, so that he is free from the local politics. Second, while appointing the governor, the president is required to consult the chief minister of the state concerned, so that the smooth functioning of the constitutional machinery in the state is ensured. However, both the conventions have been violated in some of the cases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="search-table-outter wrapper">

He should not be a member of either House of Parliament or a House of the state legislature. If any such person is appointed as governor, he is deemed to have vacated his seat in that House on the date on which he enters upon his office as the governor.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. He should not hold any other office of profit.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">3. He is entitled without payment of rent to the use of his official residence (the <i>Raj Bhavan</i>).</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">4. He is entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by Parliament.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">5. When the same person is appointed as the governor of two or more states, the emoluments and allowances payable to him are shared by the states in such proportion as determined by the president.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">6. His emoluments and allowances cannot be diminished during his term of office.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1473">In 2018, the Parliament has increased the salary of the governor from</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part740.htm#bookmark1489" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;">₹1.10 lakh to ₹3.50 lakh per month.</a><a href="part740.htm#bookmark1489" class="s34">2</a></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Like the President, the governor is also entitled to a number of privileges and immunities. He enjoys personal immunity from legal liability for his official acts. During his term of office, he is immune from any criminal proceedings, even in respect of his personal acts. He cannot be arrested or imprisoned. However, after giving two months’ notice, civil proceedings can be instituted against him during his term of office in respect of his personal acts.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Before entering upon his office, the governor has to make and subscribe to an oath or affirmation. In his oath, the governor swears:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(a) to faithfully execute the office;</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(b) to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law; and</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">(c) to devote himself to the service and well-being of the people of the state.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The oath of office to the governor is administered by the chief justice of the concerned state high court and in his absence, the senior-most judge of that court available.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Every person discharging the functions of the governor also undertakes the similar oath or affirmation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="search-table-outter wrapper">

However, this term of five years is subject to the pleasure of the President. Further, he can resign at any time by addressing a resignation letter to the President.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part740.htm#bookmark1490" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;" name="bookmark1475">The Supreme Court held that the pleasure of the President is not justifiable. The governor has no security of tenure and no fixed term of office. He may be removed by the President at any time.</a><a href="part740.htm#bookmark1490" class="s34">3</a></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution does not lay down any grounds upon which a governor may be removed by the President. Hence, the National Front Government headed by V.P. Singh (1989) asked all the governors to resign as they were appointed by the Congress government. Eventually, some of the governors were replaced and some were allowed to continue. The same thing was repeated in 1991, when the Congress Government headed by P.V. Narasimha Rao changed fourteen governors appointed by the V.P. Singh and Chandra Sekhar governments.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The President may transfer a Governor appointed to one state to another state for the rest of the term. Further, a Governor whose term has expired may be reappointed in the same state or any other state.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">A governor can hold office beyond his term of five years until his successor assumes charge. The underlying idea is that there must be a governor in the state and there cannot be an interregnum.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The President can make such provision as he thinks fit for the discharge of the functions of the governor in any contingency not provided for in the Constitution, for example, the death of a sitting governor. Thus, the chief justice of the concerned state high court may be appointed temporarily to discharge the functions of the governor of that state.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="search-table-outter wrapper">
