A Money Bill can be introduced only in the assembly and not in the council.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">2. The council cannot amend or reject a money bill. It should return the bill to the assembly within 14 days, either with recommendations or without recommendations.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">3. The assembly can either accept or reject all or any of the recommendation of the council. In both the cases, the money bill is deemed to have been passed by the two Houses.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">4. The final power to decide whether a particular bill is a money bill or not is vested in the Speaker of the assembly.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">5. The final power of passing an ordinary bill also lies with the assembly. At the most, the council can detain or delay the bill for the period of four months-three months in the first instance and one month in the second instance. In other words, the council is not even a revising body like the Rajya Sabha; it is only a dilatory chamber or an advisory body.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">6. The council can only discuss the budget but cannot vote on the demands for grants (which is the exclusive privilege of the assembly).</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">7. The council cannot remove the council of ministers by passing a no-confidence motion. This is because, the council of ministers is collectively responsible only to the assembly. But, the council can discus and criticise the policies and activities of the Government.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">8. When an ordinary bill, which has originated in the council and was sent to the assembly, is rejected by the assembly, the bill ends and becomes dead.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">9. The council does not participate in the election of the president of India and representatives of the state in the Rajya Sabha.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part786.htm#bookmark1584" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;" name="bookmark1559">10. The council has no effective say in the ratification of a constitutional amendment bill. In this respect also, the will of the assembly prevails over that of the council</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">15 </span>.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -24pt;  text-align: justify;">11. Finally, the very existence of the council depends on the will of the assembly. The council can be abolished by the Parliament on the recommendation of the assembly.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">From the above, it is clear that the position of the council <i>vis-a-vis </i>the assembly is much weaker than the position of the Rajya Sabha <i>vis-a-vis </i>the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in all spheres except financial matters and with regard to the control over the Government. On the other hand, the council is subordinate to the assembly in all respects. Thus, the predominance of the assembly over the council is fully established.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">Even though both the council and the Rajya Sabha are second chambers, the Constitution has given the council much lesser importance than the Rajya Sabha due to the following reasons:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">1. The Rajya Sabha consists of the representatives of the states and thus reflect the federal element of the polity. It maintains the federal equilibrium by protecting the interests of the states against the undue interference of the Centre. Therefore, it has to be an effective revising body and not just an advisory body or</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">dilatory body like that of the council. Onthe other hand, the issue of federal significance does not arise in the case of a council.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">2. The council is heterogeneously constituted. It represents different interests and consists of differently elected members and also include some nominated members. Its very composition makes its position weak and reduces its utility as an effective revising body. On the other hand, the Rajya Sabha is homogeneously constituted. It represents only the states and consists of mainly elected members (only 12 out of 250 are nominated).</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part786.htm#bookmark1585" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;" name="bookmark1560">3. The position accorded to the council is in accordance with the principles of democracy. The council should yield to the assembly, which is a popular house. This pattern of relationship between the two Houses of the state legislature is adopted from the British model. In Britain, the House of Lords (Upper House) cannot oppose and obstruct the House of Commons (Lower House). The House of Lords is only a dilatory chamber-it can delay an ordinary bill for a maximum period of one year and a money bill for one month.</a><a href="part786.htm#bookmark1585" class="s47">16</a></p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">Keeping in view its weak, powerless and insignificant position and role, the critics have described the council as a &#39;secondary chamber’, &#39;costly ornamental luxury’, &#39;white elephant’, etc. The critics have opined that the council has served as a refuge for those who are defeated in the assembly elections. It enabled the unpopular, rejected and ambitious politicians to occupy the post of a chief minister or a minister or a member of the state legislature.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">Even though the council has been given less powers as compared with the assembly, its utility is supported on the following grounds:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">1. It checks the hasty, defective, careless and ill-considered legislation made by the assembly by making provision for revision and thought.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">2. It facilitates representation of eminent professionals and experts who cannot face direct elections. The governor nominates one- sixth members of the council to provide representation to such people.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:16.9761pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:28pt"><td style="width:439pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:2pt;border-left-color:#D0D1D1" bgcolor="#000000"><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1435">PRIVILEGES OF STATE LEGISLATURE</a><a name="bookmark1561">&zwnj;</a></p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">Privileges of a state legislature are a sum of special rights, immunities and exemptions enjoyed by the Houses of state legislature, their committees and their members. They are necessary in order to secure the independence and effectiveness of their actions. Without these privileges, the Houses can neither maintain their authority, dignity and honour nor can protect their members from any obstruction in the discharge of their legislative responsibilities.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">The Constitution has also extended the privileges of the state legislature to those persons who are entitled to speak and take part in the proceedings of a House of the state legislature or any of its committees. These include advocate-general of the state and state ministers.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">It must be clarified here that the privileges of the state legislature do not extend to the governor who is also an integral part of the state legislature.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">The privileges of a state legislature can be classified into two broad categories-those that are enjoyed by each House of the state legislature collectively, and those that are enjoyed by the members individually.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part783.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part785.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
