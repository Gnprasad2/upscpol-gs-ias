The &quot;Look East Policy” was first initiated in 1992 by the then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">While addressing the India-ASEAN Summit (2014), the Prime Minister Narendra Modi said : &quot;A new era of economic development, industrialization and trade has begun in India. Externally, India’s &#39;Look East Policy’ has become &#39;Act East Policy’”. Similarly, the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, during her visit to Vietnam in 2014, told Indian envoys to &#39;Act East’ and not just &#39;Look East’.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1241.htm#bookmark2971" class="s85" name="bookmark2963">The features (or elements) of India’s &quot;Act East Policy” are as follows</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 5pt;">7 </span>:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. India’s Act East Policy focusses on the extended neighbourhood in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy which was originally conceived as an economic initiative, has gained political, strategic and cultural dimensions including establishment of institutional mechanisms for dialogue and cooperation.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. India has upgraded its relations to strategic partnership with Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, Singapore and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and forged close ties with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. Further, apart from ASEAN, ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and East Asia Summit (EAS), India has also been actively engaged in regional fora such as Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), Mekong Ganga Cooperation (MGC) and Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Act East Policy has placed emphasis on India-ASEAN cooperation in our domestic agenda on infrastructure, manufacturing, trade, skills, urban renewal, smart cities, Make in India and other initiatives. Connectivity projects,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">cooperation in space, S&amp;T and people-to-people exchanges could become a springboard for regional integration and prosperity.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. The objective of &#39;’Act East Policy” is to promote economic cooperation, cultural ties and develop strategic relationship with countries in the Asia-Pacific region through continuous engagement at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels thereby providing enhanced connectivity to the States of North Eastern Region including Arunanchal Pradesh with other countries in our neighbourhood.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. The North East of India has been a priority in our Act East Policy. The policy provides an interface between North East India including the state of Arunachal Pradesh and the ASEAN region.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">7. Various plans at bilateral and regional levels include steady efforts to develop and strengthen connectivity of Northeast with the ASEAN region through trade, culture, people-to- people contacts and physical infrastructure (road, airport, telecommunication, power, etc.).</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">8. On the Civilizational front, Buddhist and Hindu links are being energized to develop new contacts and connectivity between people.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">9. On Connectivity, special efforts are being made to develop a coherent strategy, particularly for linking ASEAN with North East India. Measures, including building transport infrastructure, encouraging airlines to enhance connectivity in the region, contacts between academic and cultural institutions are underway.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">10. India’s economic engagement with ASEAN has been stepped up - regional integration and implementation of projects are priorities. The ASEAN-India Agreement on Trade in Service and Investments has entered into force for India and seven ASEAN countries from 1 July 2015.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">11. On strategic issues, India has increased convergence on security interests with key partners both in bilateral and multilateral format. Closer cooperation in combating terrorism, collaborating for peace and stability in the region</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and promotion of maritime security based on international norms and laws are being pursued.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part1241.htm">NOTES AND REFERENCES</a></div><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part1239.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1241.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
