In his oath of office, the minister swears:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India,</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India,</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. to faithfully and conscientiously discharge the duties of his office, and</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. to do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill will.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In his oath of secrecy, the minister swears that he will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person(s) any matter that is brought under his consideration or becomes known to him as a Union minister except as may be required for the due discharge of his duties as such minister.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In 1990, the oath by Devi Lal as deputy prime minister was challenged as being unconstitutional as the Constitution provides only for the Prime Minister and ministers. The Supreme Court upheld the oath as valid and stated that describing a person as Deputy Prime Minister is descriptive only and such description does not confer on him any powers of Prime Minister. It ruled that the description of a minister as Deputy Prime Minister or any other type of minister such as minister of state or deputy minister of which there is no mention in the Constitution does not vitiate the oath taken by him so long as the substantive part of the oath is correct.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part454.htm#bookmark1101" class="s85" name="bookmark1086">The salaries and allowances of ministers are determined by Parliament from time to time.</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 5pt;">2</span> <span class="p">A minister gets the salary and allowances that are payable to a member of Parliament. Additionally, he gets a sumptuary allowance (according to his rank), free accommodation, travelling allowance, medical facilities, etc. In 2001, the sumptuary allowance for the prime minister was raised from ₹1,500 to ₹3,000 per month, for a cabinet minister from ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 per month, for a minister of state from ₹500</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to ₹1,000 per month and for a deputy minister from ₹300 to ₹600 per month.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part436.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part438.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
