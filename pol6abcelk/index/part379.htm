Where an assembly is dissolved, the members cease to be qualified to vote in presidential election, even if fresh elections to the dissolved assembly are not held before the presidential election.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">The Constitution provides that there shall be uniformity in the scale of representation of different states as well as parity between the states as a whole and the Union at the election of the President. To achieve this, the number of votes which each elected member of the legislative assembly of each state and the Parliament is entitled to cast at such election shall be determined in the following manner:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part395.htm#bookmark1017" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;" name="bookmark990">1. Every elected member of the legislative assembly of a state shall have as many votes as there are multiples of one thousand in the quotient obtained by dividing the population of the state by the total number of the elected members of the assembly</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">2</span>. This can be expressed as:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">2. Every elected member of either House of Parliament shall have such number of votes as may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to members of the legislative assemblies of the states by the total number of the elected</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">members of both the Houses of Parliament. This can be expressed as:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">The Presidentâ€™s election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote and the voting is by secret ballot. This system ensures that the successful candidate is returned by the absolute majority of votes. A candidate, in order to be declared elected to the office of President, must secure a fixed quota of votes. The quota of votes is determined by dividing the total number of valid votes polled by the number of candidates to be elected (here only one candidate is to be elected as President) plus one and adding one to the quotient. The formula can be expressed as:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">Each member of the electoral college is given only one ballot paper. The voter, while casting his vote, is required to indicate his preferences by marking 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. against the names of candidates. This means that the voter can indicate as many preferences as there are candidates in the fray.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">In the first phase, the first preference votes are counted. In case a candidate secures the required quota in this phase, he is declared elected. Otherwise, the process of transfer of votes is set in motion. The ballots of the candidate securing the least number of first preference votes are cancelled and his second preference votes are transferred to the first preference votes of other candidates. This process continues till a candidate secures the required quota.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">All doubts and disputes in connection with election of the President are inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision is final. The election of a person as President cannot be challenged on the ground that the electoral college was incomplete (ie, existence of any vacancy among the members of electoral college). If the election of a person as President is declared void by the Supreme Court, acts done by him before the date of such declaration of the Supreme Court are not invalidated and continue to remain in force.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part395.htm#bookmark1018" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;" name="bookmark991">Some members of the Constituent Assembly criticised the system of indirect election for the President as undemocratic and proposed the idea of direct election. However, the Constitution makers chose the indirect election due to the following reasons</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">3 </span>:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">1. The indirect election of the President is in harmony with the parliamentary system of government envisaged in the Constitution. Under this system, the President is only a nominal executive and the real powers are vested in the council of ministers headed by the prime minister. It would have been anomalous to have the President elected directly by the people and not give him any real power.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">2. The direct election of the President would have been very costly and time- and energy-consuming due to the vast size of the electorate. This is unwarranted keeping in view that he is only a symbolic head.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">Some members of the Constituent Assembly suggested that the President should be elected by the members of the two Houses of Parliament alone. The makers of the Constitution did not prefer this as the Parliament, dominated by one political party, would have invariably chosen a candidate from that party and such a President could not represent the states of the Indian Union. The present system makes the President a representative of the Union and the states equally.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;  text-align: justify;">Further, it was pointed out in the Constituent Assembly that the expression &#39;proportional representationâ€™ in the case of presidential election is a misnomer. Proportional representation takes place where two or more seats are to be filled. In case of the President, the vacancy is only one. It could better be called a preferential or alternative vote system. Similarly, the expression &#39;single transferable voteâ€™ was also objected on the ground that no voter has a single vote; every voter has plural votes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:16.9761pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:28pt"><td style="width:439pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:2pt;border-left-color:#D0D1D1" bgcolor="#000000"><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark869">QUALIFICATIONS, OATH AND CONDITIONS</a><a name="bookmark992">&zwnj;</a></p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s55" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Qualifications for Election as President</p><p class="s45" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">A person to be eligible for election as President should fulfil the following qualifications:</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">1.

He should be qualified for election as a member of the Lok Sabha.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -17pt;  text-align: justify;">4. He should not hold any office of profit under the Union government or any state government or any local authority or any other public authority. A sitting President or VicePresident of the Union, the Governor of any state and a minister of the Union or any state is not deemed to hold any office of profit and hence qualified as a presidential candidate.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part395.htm#bookmark1019" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;" name="bookmark993">Further, the nomination of a candidate for election to the office of President must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Every candidate has to make a security deposit of â‚¹15,000 in the Reserve Bank of India. The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled. Before 1997, number of proposers and seconders was ten each and the amount of security deposit was â‚¹2,500. In 1997, they were increased to discourage the non-serious candidates</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">4 </span>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part378.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part380.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
