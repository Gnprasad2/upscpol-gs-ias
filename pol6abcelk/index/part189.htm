By Naturalisation</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Central Government may, on an application, grant a certificate of naturalisation to any person (not being an illegal migrant) if he possesses the following qualifications:</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">(a) that he is not a subject or citizen of any country where citizens of India are prevented from becoming subjects or citizens of that country by naturalisation;</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">(b) that, if he is a citizen of any country, he undertakes to renounce the citizenship of that country in the event of his application for Indian citizenship being accepted;</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">(c) that he has either resided in India or been in the service of a Government in India or partly the one and partly the other, throughout the period of twelve months immediately preceding the date of the application;</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">(d) that during the fourteen years immediately preceding the said period of twelve months, he has either resided in India or been in the service of a Government in India, or partly the one and partly the other, for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than eleven years;</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(e) that he is of good character;</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part194.htm#bookmark376" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%;" name="bookmark363">(f) that he has an adequate knowledge of a language specified in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 4pt;">3 </span>; and</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">(g) that in the event of a certificate of naturalisation being granted to him, he intends to reside in India, or to enter into or continue in, service under a Government in India or under an international organisation of which India is a member or under a society, company or body of persons established in India. However, the Government of India may waive all or any of the above conditions for naturalisation in the case of a person who has rendered distinguished service to the science, philosophy, art, literature, world peace or human progress. Every naturalised citizen must take an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of India.</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">5. By Incorporation of Territory</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If any foreign territory becomes a part of India, the Government of India specifies the persons who among the people of the territory shall be the citizens of India. Such persons become the citizens of India from the notified date. For example, when Pondicherry became a part of India, the Government of India issued the Citizenship (Pondicherry) Order (1962), under the Citizenship Act (1955).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">6.

Such a registered person shall be deemed to be a citizen of India for all purposes as from the date of expiry of a period of ten years from the date of detection as a foreigner. But, in the intervening period of ten years, he shall have the same rights and obligations as a citizen of India, excepting the right to vote.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part188.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part190.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
