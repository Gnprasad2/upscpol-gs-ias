Some of the observations made by it, in this regard, are given below:</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1341" class="s85" name="bookmark1320">&quot;In India it is the Constitution that is supreme and that a statute law to be valid, must be in conformity with the constitutional requirements and it is for the judiciary to decide whether any enactment is constitutional or not”.</a><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1341" class="s14">2</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1342" class="s85" name="bookmark1321">&quot;Our constitution contains express provisions for judicial review of legislation as to its conformity with the constitution. This is especially true as regards the Fundamental Rights, to which the court has been assigned the role of sentinel on the qui vive”.</a><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1342" class="s14">3</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1343" class="s85" name="bookmark1322">&quot;As long as some Fundamental Rights exist and are a part of the Constitution, the power of judicial review has also to be exercised with a view to see that the guarantees afforded by these Rights are not contravened”.</a><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1343" class="s14">4</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1344" class="s85" name="bookmark1323">&quot;The Constitution is supreme lex, the permanent law of the land, and there is no branch of government above it. Every organ of government, be it the executive or the legislature of the judiciary, derives its authority from the Constitution and it has to act within the limits of its authority. No one however highly placed and no authority howsoever lofty, can claim that it shall be the sole judge of the extent of its power under the Constitution or whether its action is within the confines of such power laid down by the constitution. This Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and to this Court is assigned the delicate task of determining what is the power conferred on each branch of government, whether it is limited, and if so, what are the limits and whether any action of that branch transgresses such limits”.</a><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1344" class="s14">5</a></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;It is the function of the Judges, may their duty, to pronounce upon the validity of laws.

The function of judicial review is a part of the constitutional interpretation itself. It adjusts the Constitution to meet new conditions and needs of the time”.</a><a href="part717.htm#bookmark1347" class="s14">8</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part712.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part714.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
