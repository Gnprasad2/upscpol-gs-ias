The members of these services occupy top positions (or key posts) under both the Centre and the states and serve them by turns.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At present, there are three all-India services. They are:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Indian Administrative Service (IAS)</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Indian Police Service (IPS)</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.

In 1966, the Indian Forest Service was established as the third all-India service</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 5pt;">1 </span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The All-India Services Act of 1951 authorised the Central government to make rules in consultation with the state governments for the regulation of recruitment and service conditions of the members of all-India services. The members of these services are recruited and trained by the Central government but are assigned to different states for work. They belong to different state cadres; the Centre having no cadre of its own in this regard. They serve the Central government on deputation and after completing their fixed tenure they go back to their respective states. The Central government obtains the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">services of these officers on deputation under the well-known tenure system. It must be noted here that irrespective of their division among different states, each of these all-India services form a single service with common rights and status and uniform scales of pay throughout the country. Their salaries and pensions are met by the states.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The all-India services are controlled jointly by the Central and state governments. The ultimate control lies with the Central government while the immediate control is vested in the state governments. Any disciplinary action (imposition of penalties) against these officers can only be taken by the Central government.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the chief protagonist of all-India services in the Constituent Assembly. Hence, he came to be regarded as the &#39;Father of all-India Servicesâ€™.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part1038.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1040.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
