This Committee comprises of 30 members of Parliament, 20 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Act contains the following provisions relating to the composition and functions of the committee:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1.
