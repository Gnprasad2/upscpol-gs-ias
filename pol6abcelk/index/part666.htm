In the </a><i>First Judges </i>case (1982), the Court held that consultation does not mean concurrence and it only implies exchange of views. But, in the <i>Second Judges </i>case (1993), the Court reversed its earlier ruling and changed the meaning of the word consultation to concurrence. Hence, it ruled that the advice tendered by the Chief Justice of India is binding on the President in the matters of appointment of the judges of the Supreme Court. But, the Chief Justice would tender his advice on the matter after consulting two of his seniormost colleagues. Similarly, in the <i>Third Judges </i><a href="part710.htm#bookmark1306" class="s85">case</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 5pt;">2</span><span class="s15"> </span>(1998), the Court opined that the consultation process to be</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">adopted by the Chief justice of India requires &#39;consultation of plurality judges’. The sole opinion of the chief justice of India does not constitute the consultation process. He should consult a collegium of four seniormost judges of the Supreme Court and even if two judges give an adverse opinion, he should not send the recommendation to the government. The court held that the recommendation made by the chief justice of India without complying with the norms and requirements of the consultation process are not binding on the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The 99<span class="s21">th </span>Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014 and the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act of 2014 have replaced the collegium system of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts with a new body called the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). However, in 2015, the Supreme Court has declared both the 99<span class="s21">th </span>Constitutional Amendment as well as the NJAC Act as unconstitutional and void. Consequently, the earlier collegium system became operative again. This verdict was delivered by the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judges case<span class="s21">2a </span>(2015). The court opined that the new system (i.e., NJAC) would affect the independence of the judiciary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part665.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part667.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
