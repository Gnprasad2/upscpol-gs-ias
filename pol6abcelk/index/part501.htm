The leader of the largest Opposition party having not less than one-tenth seats of the total strength of the House is recognised as the leader of the Opposition in that House. In a parliamentary system of government, the leader of the opposition has a significant role to play. His main functions are to provide a constructive criticism of the policies of the government and to provide an alternative government. Therefore, the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha were accorded statutory recognition in 1977. They are also entitled to the salary, allowances and other facilities equivalent to that of a cabinet minister. It was in 1969 that an official leader of the opposition was recognised for the first time. The same functionary in USA is known as the &#39;minority leader’.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The British political system has an unique institution called the &#39;Shadow Cabinet’. It is formed by the Opposition party to balance the ruling cabinet and to prepare its members for future ministerial offices. In this shadow cabinet, almost every member in the ruling cabinet is &#39;shadowed’ by a corresponding member in the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">opposition cabinet. This shadow cabinet serves as the &#39;alternate cabinet’ if there is change of government. That is why Ivor Jennings described the leader of Opposition as the &#39;alternative Prime Minister’. He enjoys the status of a minister and is paid by the government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part500.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part502.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
