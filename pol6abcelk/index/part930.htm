The accountability of the executive (i.e., council of ministers) to the Parliament in the sphere of financial administration is secured through audit reports of the CAG. The CAG is an agent of the Parliament and conducts audit of expenditure on behalf of the Parliament. Therefore, he is responsible only to the Parliament.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The CAG has more freedom with regard to audit of expenditure than with regard to audit of receipts, stores and stock. &quot;Whereas in relation to expenditure he decides the scope of audit and frames his own audit codes and manuals, he has to proceed with the approval of the executive government in relation to rules for the conduct of the other audits.”<span class="s21">3a</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The CAG has &#39;to ascertain whether money shown in the accounts as having been disbursed was legally available for and applicable to the service or the purpose to which they have been applied or charged and whether the expenditure conforms to the authority that governs it’. In addition to this legal and regulatory audit, the CAG can also conduct the propriety audit, that is, he can look into the &#39;wisdom, faithfulness and economy’ of government expenditure and comment on the wastefulness and extravagance of such expenditure. However, unlike the legal and regulatory audit, which is obligatory on the part of the CAG, the propriety audit is discretionary.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The secret service expenditure is a limitation on the auditing role of the CAG. In this regard, the CAG cannot call for particulars of expenditure incurred by the executive agencies, but has to accept a certificate from the competent administrative authority that the expenditure has been so incurred under his authority.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution of India visualises the CAG to be Comptroller as well as Auditor General. However, in practice, the CAG is fulfilling the role of an Auditor-General only and not that of a Comptroller. In other words, &#39;the CAG has no control over the issue of money from the consolidated fund and many departments are authorised to draw money by issuing cheques without specific</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part933.htm#bookmark2127" class="s85" name="bookmark2118">authority from the CAG, who is concerned only at the audit stage when the expenditure has already taken place’</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 5pt;">4</span>. In this respect, the CAG of India differs totally from the CAG of Britain who has powers of both Comptroller as well as Auditor General. In other words, in Britain, the executive can draw money from the public exchequer only with the approval of the CAG.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part929.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part931.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
