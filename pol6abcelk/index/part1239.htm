This policy is aimed at strengthening and expanding of India’s relations with the Central Asian countries. These countries include Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1241.htm#bookmark2970" class="s85" name="bookmark2961">India’s &quot;Connect Central Asia” policy is a broad-based approach including political, security, economic and cultural connections. Its features (or elements) are as follows</a><span style=" color: #0000ED; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 5pt;">6 </span>:</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. India will continue to build on its strong political relations through the exchange of high level visits. India’s leaders will continue to interact closely both in bilateral and multilateral fora.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. India will strengthen its strategic and security cooperation. India already has strategic partnerships with some Central Asian countries. The focus will be on military training, joint research, counter-terrorism coordination and close consultations on Afghanistan.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. India will step up multilateral engagement with Central Asian partners using the synergy of joint efforts through existing fora like the SCO, Eurasian Economic Community (EEC) and the Custom Union. India has already proposed a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement to integrate its markets with the unifying Eurasian space.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. India looks to Central Asia as a longterm partner in energy, and natural resources. Central Asia possesses large cultivable tracts of land and there is potential for India to cooperate in production of profitable crops with value addition.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. The medical field is another area that offers huge potential for cooperation. India is ready to extend cooperation by setting up civil hospitals/clinics in Central Asia.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. India’s higher education system delivers at a fraction of the fees charged by Western universities. Keeping this in mind, India would like to assist in the setting up of a Central Asian University in Bishkek that could come up as a centre of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">excellence to impart world class education in areas like IT, management, philosophy and languages.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">7. India is working on setting up a Central Asian e-network with its hub in India, to deliver, tele-education and tele-medicine connectivity, linking all the five Central Asian States.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">8. Indian companies can showcase India’s capability in the construction sector and build world class structures at competitive rates. Central Asian countries, especially Kazakhstan, have almost limitless reserves of iron ore and coal, as well as abundant cheap electricity. India can help set up several medium size steel rolling mills, producing its requirement of specific products.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">9. As for land connectivity, India has reactivated the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). There is a need to discuss ways to bridge the missing links in the Corridor at the earliest and also work on other connecting spurs along the route.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">10. Absence of a viable banking infrastructure in the region is a major barrier to trade and investment. Indian banks can expand their presence if they see a favourable policy environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">11. India and Central Asian nations will jointly work to improve air connectivity between them. India is one of the biggest markets for outbound travelers estimated at USD 21 billion in 2011. Many countries have opened tourist offices in India to woo Indian tourists. Central Asian countries could emerge as attractive holiday destinations for tourists and even for the Indian film industry which likes to depict exotic foreign locales in its films.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">12. Connections between the people are the most vital linkages to sustain the deep engagement. There is particularly need to emphasise exchanges between youth and the future leaders of India and Central Asia. There is already a robust exchange of students. India and Central Asian nations will encourage regular exchanges of scholars, academics, civil society and youth delegations to gain deeper insights into each other’s cultures.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">India’s &quot;Connect Central Asia” policy is consonant with its overall policy of deepening engagement in Eurasia, its policy of strengthening relations with China, with Pakistan, and building on its traditional relationship with Russia. India hopes that its membership in numerous regional forums including at the SCO, would bolster India’s renewed linkages with the region.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part1238.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1240.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
