The chairperson should be a retired Chief Justice or a Judge of a High Court and members should be a serving or retired judge of a High Court or a District Judge in the state with a minimum of seven years experience as District Judge and a person having knowledge or practical experience with respect to human rights.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The chairperson and members are appointed by the Governor on the recommendations of a committee consisting of the chief minister as its head, the speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the state home minister and the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Assembly. In the case of a state having Legislative Council, the chairman of the Council and the leader of the opposition in the Council would also be the members of the committee. Further, a sitting judge of a High Court or a sitting District Judge can be appointed only after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court of the concerned state.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The chairperson and members hold office for a term of three years or until they attain the age of 70 years, whichever is earlier. They are elligible for re-appointment. After their tenure, the chairperson and members are not eligible for further employment under a state government or the Central government.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Although the chairperson and members of a State Human Rights Commission are appointed by the governor, they can be removed only by the President (and not by the governor). The President can remove them on the same grounds and in the same manner as he can remove the chairperson or a member of the National Human Rights Commission. Thus, he can remove the chairperson or a member under the following circumstances:</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(a) If he is adjudged an insolvent; or</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(b) If he engages, during his term of office, in any paid employment outside the duties of his office; or</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(c) If he is unfit to continue in office by reason of infirmity of mind or body; or</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(d) If he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">(e) If he is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for an offence.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to these, the president can also remove the chairperson or a member on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. However, in these cases, the President has to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an inquiry. If the Supreme Court, after the inquiry, upholds the cause of removal and advises so, then the President can remove the chairperson or a member.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The salaries, allowances and other conditions of service of the chairperson or a member are determined by the state government. But, they cannot be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">All the above provisions are aimed at securing autonomy, independence and impartiality in the functioning of the Commission.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part954.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part956.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
