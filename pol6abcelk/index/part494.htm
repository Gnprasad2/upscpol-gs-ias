He is elected after the election of the Speaker has taken place. The date of election of the Deputy Speaker is fixed by the Speaker. Whenever the office of the Deputy Speaker falls vacant, the Lok Sabha elects another member to fill the vacancy.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker remains in office usually during the life of the Lok Sabha. However, he may vacate his office earlier in any of the following three cases:</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. if he ceases to be a member of the Lok Sabha;</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. if he resigns by writing to the Speaker; and</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all the then members of the Lok Sabha. Such a resolution can be moved only after giving 14 days’ advance notice.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker’s office when it is vacant. He also acts as the Speaker when the latter is absent from the sitting of the House. In both the cases, he assumes all the powers of the Speaker. He also presides over the joint sitting of both the Houses of Parliament, in case the Speaker is absent from such a sitting.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">It should be noted here that the Deputy Speaker is not subordinate to the Speaker. He is directly responsible to the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">House.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Deputy Speaker has one special privilege, that is, whenever he is appointed as a member of a parliamentary committee, he automatically becomes its chairman.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, while presiding over the House, cannot vote in the first instance; he can only exercise a casting vote in the case of a tie. Further, when a resolution for the removal of the Deputy Speaker is under consideration of the House, he cannot preside at the sitting of the House, though he may be present.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">When the Speaker presides over the House, the Deputy Speaker is like any other ordinary member of the House. He can speak in the House, participate in its proceedings and vote on any question before the House.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Deputy Speaker is entitled to a regular salary and allowance fixed by Parliament, and charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Upto the 10th Lok Sabha, both the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker were usually from the ruling party. Since the 11th Lok Sabha, there has been a consensus that the Speaker comes from the ruling party (or ruling alliance) and the post of Deputy Speaker goes to the main opposition party.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, while assuming their offices, do not make and subscribe any separate oath or affirmation.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The institutions of Speaker and Deputy Speaker originated in India in 1921 under the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1919 (Montague-Chelmsford Reforms). At that time, the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker were called the President and Deputy President respectively and the same nomenclature continued till 1947. Before 1921, the Governor-General of India used to preside over the meetings of the Central Legislative Council. In 1921, the Frederick Whyte and Sachidanand Sinha were appointed by the Governor-General of India as the first Speaker and the first Deputy Speaker (respectively) of the central legislative assembly. In 1925, Vithalbhai J. Patel became the first Indian and the first elected Speaker of the central legislative assembly. The Government of India Act of 1935 changed the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">nomenclatures of President and Deputy President of the Central Legislative Assembly to the Speaker and Deputy Speaker respectively. However, the old nomenclature continued till 1947 as the federal part of the 1935 Act was not implemented. G.V. Mavalankar and Ananthasayanam Ayyangar had the distinction of being the first Speaker and the first Deputy Speaker (respectively) of the Lok Sabha. G.V. Mavalankar also held the post of Speaker in the Constituent Assembly (Legislative) as well as the provisional Parliament. He held the post of Speaker of Lok Sabha continuously for one decade from 1946 to 1956.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"  ><a href="part493.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part495.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav"  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
