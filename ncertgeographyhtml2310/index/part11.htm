Water is present in the atmosphere in three forms namely - gaseous, liquid and solid. The moisture in the atmosphere is derived from water bodies through evaporation and from plants through transpiration. Thus, there is a continuous exchange of water between the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation and precipitation.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1653">Water vapour present in the air is known as humidity. It is expressed quantitatively in different ways. The actual amount of the water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the </a><i>absolute humidity. </i>It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre. The ability of the air to hold water vapour depends entirely on its temperature. The  absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth. The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the <i>relative humidity. </i>With the change of air temperature, the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the relative humidity is also affected. It is greater over the oceans and least over the continents.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1654">The air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be </a><i>saturated. </i>It means that the air at the given temperature is incapable of holding any additional amount of moisture at that stage. The temperature at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air is known as <i>dew point.</i></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">condensation respectively. Evaporation is a process by which water is transformed from liquid to gaseous state. Heat is the main cause for evaporation. The temperature at which the water starts evaporating is referred to as the <i>latent heat of vapourisation.</i></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1657">Increase in temperature increases water absorption and retention capacity of the given parcel of air. Similarly, if the moisture content is low, air has a potentiality of absorbing and retaining moisture. Movement of air replaces the saturated layer with the unsaturated layer. Hence, the greater the movement of air, the greater is the evaporation.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1658">The transformation of water vapour into water is called </a><i>condensation. </i>Condensation is caused by the loss of heat. When moist air is cooled, it may reach a level when its capacity to hold water vapour ceases. Then, the excess water vapour condenses into liquid form. If it directly condenses into solid form, it is known as <i>sublimation. </i>In free air, condensation results from cooling around very small particles termed as hygroscopic condensation nuclei. Particles of dust, smoke and salt from the ocean are particularly good nuclei because they absorb water. Condensation also takes place when the moist air comes in contact with some colder object and it may also take place when the temperature is close to the dew point. Condensation, therefore, depends upon the amount of cooling and the relative humidity of the air. Condensation is influenced by the volume of air, temperature, pressure and humidity. Condensation takes place: (i) when</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1660">the temperature of the air is reduced to dew point  with its volume remaining constant; (ii) when both the volume and the temperature are reduced; (iv) when moisture is added to the air through evaporation. However, the most favourable condition for condensation is the decrease in air temperature.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1661">After condensation the water vapour or the moisture in the atmosphere takes one of the following forms — dew, frost, fog and clouds. Forms of condensation can be classified on the basis of temperature and location. Condensation takes place when the dew point is lower than the freezing point as well as higher than the freezing point.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1662">Dew</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark12954">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1663">When the moisture is deposited in the form of water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in air above the surface) such as stones, grass blades and plant leaves, it is known as </a><i>dew. </i>The ideal conditions for its formation are clear sky, calm air, high relative humidity, and cold and long nights.

So, the </a><i>fog </i>is a cloud with its base at or very near to the ground. Because of the fog and mist, the visibility becomes poor to zero. In urban and industrial centres smoke provides plenty of nuclei which help the formation of fog and mist.

In mist each nuceli contains a thicker layer of moisture. Mists are frequent over mountains as the rising warm air up the slopes  meets a cold surface. Fogs are drier than mist and they are prevalent where warm currents of air come in contact with cold currents. Fogs are mini clouds in which condensation takes place around nuclei provided by the dust, smoke, and the salt particles.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1669">Clouds</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark12957">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1670">Cloud is a  mass  of  minute water  droplets or tiny crystals of ice formed by the condensation of the water vapour in free air at considerable elevations.

When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall on to the earth’s surface. So after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as </a><i>precipitation. </i>This may take place in liquid or solid form. The precipitation in the form of water is called <i>rainfall, </i>when the temperature is lower than the 0°C, precipitation takes place in the form of fine flakes of snow and is called <i>snowfall. </i>Moisture is released in the form of hexagonal crystals. These crystals form flakes of snow. Besides rain and snow, other forms of precipitation are <i>sleet </i>and <i>hail, </i>though the latter are limited in occurrence and are sporadic in both time and space.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1686">Sleet </a><span class="p">is frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow-water.

Areas lying in the rain shadow zone of the interior of the continents and high latitudes receive very low rainfall-less than 50 cm per annum.
