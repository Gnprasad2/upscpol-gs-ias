The Information Technology (IT) revolution opened up new possibilities of economic and social transformation. The IT and IT enabled business process outsourcing (ITES- BPO) services continue to be on a robust growth path. Indian software industry has emerged as one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy. Exports of the Indian software and services sector were Rs. 78,230 crore in 2004-05 which is approximately 30-32 per cent increase from the previous year. The software industry has surpassed electronic hardware production. The Indian government has created a number of software parks in the country.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9564">The IT software and services industry account for almost 2 per cent of India’s GDP. India’s software industry has achieved a remarkable distinction for providing quality products. A large number of Indian software companies have acquired international quality certification. A majority of the multinational companies operating in the area of information technology have either software development centres or research development centres  in India. However, in the hardware development sector, India is yet to make any remarkable achievements.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9565">A major impact of this growth has been on employment creation, which is almost doubled every year.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9568">distortions or weaknesses that have crept in, maintain a sustained growth in productivity and gainful employment and attain international competitiveness.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9569">Within this policy, measures initiated are :</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">(1) abolition of industrial licensing, (2) free entry to foreign technology, (3) foreign investment policy, (4) access to capital market, (5) open trade, (6) abolition of phased manufacturing programme, and (7) liberalised industrial location programme. The policy has three main dimensions: <span class="s167">liberalisation</span>, <span class="s167">privatisation </span>and</p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">globalisation<span class="s216" style="  ">.</span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9570">The industrial licensing system has been abolished for all except six industries related to security, strategic or environmental concerns. At the same time, the number of industries reserved for public sector since 1956 have been reduced from 17 to 4. Industries related to atomic energy, substances specified in the Schedule of the Department of Atomic Energy as well as Railways have remained under the public sector. The government also has decided to offer a part of the shareholdings in the public enterprises to financial institutions, general public and workers. The threshold limits of assets have been scrapped and no industry requires prior approval for investing in the delicensed sector. They only need to submit a memorandum in the prescribed format.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9571">In the new industrial policy, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been seen as a supplement to the domestic investment for achieving a higher level of economic development. FDI benefits the domestic industry as well as the consumers by providing technological upgradation, access to global managerial skills and practices, optimum use of natural and human resources, etc. Keeping all this in mind, foreign investment has been liberalised and the government has permitted access to an automatic route for Foreign Direct Investment. The government has also announced changes in the industrial location policies.

In spite of all these concessions, Foreign Direct Investment has not been up to the expectation. There has been a big gap between approved and actual foreign direct investment, even though the numbers of foreign collaborations are increasing. Larger parts of this investment have gone to domestic appliances, finance, services, electronics and electrical equipment, and food and dairy products.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9577">Globalisation means integrating the economy of the country with the world economy. Under this process, goods and services along with capital, labour and resources can  move  freely  from one  nation  to another. The thrust of globalisation has been to increase the domestic and external competition through extensive application of market mechanism and facilitating dynamic relationship with the foreign investors and suppliers of technology. In Indian context, this implies: (1) opening of the economy to foreign direct investment by providing facilities to foreign companies to invest in different fields of economies activity in India; (2) removing restrictions and obstacles to the entry of multi­ national companies in India; (3) allowing Indian companies to enter into foreign collaboration in India and also encouraging them to set up joint ventures abroad; (4) carrying out massive import liberalisation programmes by switching over from quantitative restrictions to tariffs in</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9578">the first place, and then bringing down the level of import duties considerably; and (5) instead of a set of export incentives, opting for exchange rate adjustments for promoting export.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9579">A breakup of foreign collaboration approval reveals that the major share went to core, priority sectors while infrastructural sector was untouched. Further, gap between developed and developing states has become wider. Major share of both domestic investment as well as foreign direct investment went to already developed states. For example, out of the total proposed investment by the industrial entrepreneurs during 1991-2000 nearly one­ fourth (23 per cent) was for industrially developed Maharashtra, 17 per cent for Gujarat, 7 per cent for Andhra Pradesh, and about 6 per cent for Tamil Nadu while Uttar Pradesh, the state with  the largest  population has only 8 per cent. In spite of several concessions, seven north-eastern states could get less than 1 per cent of the proposed investment. In fact, economically weaker states could not compete with the developed states in open market in attracting industrial investment proposals and hence they are likely to suffer from these processes.</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part114.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part116.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script></body></html>
