Tropical evergreen forests are well stratified, with layers closer to the ground and are covered with shrubs and creepers, with short structured trees followed by tall variety of trees. In these forests, trees reach great heights up to 60 m or above. There is no definite time for trees to shed their leaves, flowering and fruition. As such these forests appear green all the year round. Species found in these forests include rosewood, mahogony, aini, ebony, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3269">The semi evergreen forests are found in the less rainy parts of these regions.

Forests were also cleared for introducing plantations of tea, rubber and coffee. The British also used timber for construction activities as it acts as an insulator of heat.

Deciduous forests are found in the foothills of the Himalayas. It is succeeded by the wet temperate type of forests between an altitude of 1,000-2,000 m. In the higher hill ranges of northeastern India, hilly areas of West Bengal and Uttaranchal, evergreen broad leaf trees such as oak and chestnut are predominant. Between 1,500-1,750 m, pine forests are also well-developed in this zone, with Chir Pine as a very useful commercial tree. Deodar, a highly valued endemic species grows mainly in the western part  of  the  Himalayan  range. Deodar is a durable wood mainly used in construction activity. Similarly, the </a><i>chinar </i>and the walnut, which sustain the famous Kashmir handicrafts, belong to this zone. Blue pine and spruce appear at altitudes of 2,225-3,048 m. At many places in this zone, temperate grasslands are also found. But in the higher reaches there is a transition to Alpine forests and pastures. Silver firs, junipers, pines, birch and rhododendrons, etc. occur between 3,000-4,000 m. However, these pastures are used extensively for transhumance by tribes like the Gujjars, the Bakarwals, the Bhotiyas and the Gaddis. The southern slopes of the Himalayas carry a thicker vegetation cover because of relatively higher precipitation than the drier north-facing slopes. At higher altitudes, mosses and lichens form part of the tundra vegetation.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3288">The southern mountain forests </a><span class="p">include the forests found in three distinct areas of Peninsular India viz; the Western Ghats, the Vindhyas and the Nilgiris.

The temperate forests are called </span>Sholas <span class="p">in the Nilgiris, Anaimalai and Palani hills. Some of the other trees of this forest of economic significance include, magnolia, laurel, cinchona and wattle.

The former is based on the records of the State Revenue Department, while the latter is based on aerial photographs and satellite imageries. In 2001, the actual forest cover was only 20.55 per cent.

The  importance  of  forests  in tribal economy is  well-known  as they are the source of sustenance and livelihood for tribal communities. It is commonly believed that the tribal communities live in harmony with nature and protect forests. Out of a  total of 593 districts 187 (2001) have been identified as tribal districts.

Community forestry involves the  raising of trees on public or community land such as the village pasture and temple land, roadside, canal bank, strips along railway lines, and schools etc. Community forestry programme aims at providing benefits to the community as a whole. Community forestry provides a means under which the people of landless classes can associate themselves in tree­ raising and thus, get those benefits which otherwise are restricted for landowners.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13027">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3327">Farm Forestry</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3328">Farm forestry is a term applied to the process under which farmers grow trees for commercial and non-commercial purposes on their farm lands.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3329">Forest departments of various states distribute seedlings of trees free of cost to small and medium farmers.
