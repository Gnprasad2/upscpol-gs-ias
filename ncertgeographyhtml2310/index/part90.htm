It is in this belt comprising Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand, the growth rate on the average remained 20-25 per cent.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_458.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8015">An important aspect of population growth in India is the growth of its adolescents. At present the share of adolescents i.e. up to the age group of 10-19 years is about 22 per cent (2001), among which male adolescents constitute 53 per cent and female adolescents constitute 47 per cent. The adolescent population, though, regarded as the youthful population having high potentials, but at the same time they are quite vulnerable if not guided and channelised properly. There are many challenges for the society as far as these adolescents  are concerned, some of which are lower age at marriage, illiteracy - particularly female illiteracy, school dropouts, low intake of nutrients, high rate of maternal mortality of adolescent mothers, high rates of HIV/AIDS infections, physical and mental disability or retardedness, drug abuse and alcoholism, juvenile delinquency and commitence of crimes, etc.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark8031">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8016">In view of these, the Government of India</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8018">has undertaken certain policies to impart proper education to the adolescent groups so that their talents are better channelised and properly utilised. The National Youth Policy is one example which has been designed to look into the overall development of our large youth and adolescent population.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8019">The National Youth  Policy  of  Government of India, launched in 2003, stresses on an all­ round improvement of the youth and adolescents enabling them to shoulder responsibility towards constructive development of the country. It also aims at reinforcing the qualities of patriotism and responsible citizenship.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_459.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8017">The thrust of this policy is youth empowerment in terms of their effective participation in decision making and carrying the responsibility of an able leader. Special emphasis was given in empowering women and girl child to bring parity in the male-female status. Moreover, deliberate efforts were made</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark8020">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8021">to look into youth health, sports and recreation, creativity and awareness about new innovations in the spheres of science and technology.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8022">It appears from the above discussion that the growth rate of population is widely variant over space and time in the country and also highlights various social problems related to the growth of population. However, in order to have a better insight into the growth pattern of population it is also necessary to look into the social composition of population.</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part89.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part91.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script></body></html>
