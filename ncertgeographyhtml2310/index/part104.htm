In 2001 about 53 per cent population of the country was dependent on it. The importance of agricultural sector in India can be gauged from the fact that about 57 per cent of its land is devoted to crop cultivation, whereas, in the world, the corresponding share is only about 12 per cent. In spite of this, there is tremendous pressure on agricultural land in India, which is reflected from the fact that the land-human ratio in the country is only 0.31 ha which is almost half of that of the world as a whole (0.59 ha). Despite various constraints, Indian agriculture has marched a long way since Independence.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8988">Strategy of Development</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13192">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_553.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8989">Indian agricultural economy was largely subsistence in nature before Independence. It had dismal performance in the first half of twentieth century. This period witnessed severe droughts and famines. During partition about one-third of the irrigated land in undivided India went to Pakistan. This reduced the proportion of irrigated area in Independent</a></p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark8993"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_554.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></a>	<span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_555.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span><a class="s216" name="bookmark8992">&zwnj;</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark8991">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8994">India. After Independence, the immediate goal of the Government was to increase foodgrains production by (i) switching over from cash crops to food crops; (ii) intensification of cropping over already cultivated land; and (iii) increasing cultivated area by bringing cultivable and fallow land under plough. Initially, this strategy helped in increasing foodgrains production. But agricultural production stagnated during late 1950s. To overcome this problem, Intensive Agricultural District Programme (IADP) and Intensive Agricultural Area Programme (IAAP) were launched. But two consecutive droughts during mid-1960s resulted in food crisis in the country. Consequently, the foodgrains were imported from other countries.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9000">&zwnj;</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark8999">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8995">New seed varieties of wheat (Mexico) and</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">rice (Philippines) known as high yielding varieties (HYVs) were available for cultivation by mid-1960s. India took advantage of this and introduced package technology comprising HYVs, along with chemical fertilizers in irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. Assured supply of soil moisture through irrigation was a basic pre-requisite for the success of this new agricultural technology. This strategy of agricultural development paid dividends instantly and increased the foodgrains production at very fast rate. This spurt of</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">agricultural growth came to be known as ‘<span class="s167">Green Revolution</span>’. This also gave fillip to the development of a large number of agro-inputs, agro-processing industries and small-scale industries. This strategy of agricultural development made the country self-reliant in foodgrain production. But green revolution was</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">initially confined to irrigated areas only. This led to regional disparities in agricultural development in the country till the seventies, after which the technology spread to the Eastern and Central parts of the country.</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8996">The Planning Commission of India focused its attention on the problems of agriculture in rainfed areas in 1980s. It initiated agro-climatic planning in 1988 to induce regionally balanced agricultural development in the country. It also emphasised</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8997">the need for diversification of agriculture and harnessing of resources for development of dairy farming, poultry, horticulture, livestock rearing and aquaculture.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_556.png"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8998">Initiation of the policy of liberalisation and free market economy in 1990s is likely to influence the course of  development of Indian agriculture. Lack of development of rural infrastructure, withdrawal of subsidies and price support, and impediments in availing of the rural credits may lead to inter-regional and inter-personal disparities in rural areas.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9001">the consumption of chemical fertilizers per unit area is three to four times higher than that of the national average.
