These are successfully grown from sea level to about 2,000 m altitude and from humid areas in eastern India to dry but irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, western U.P. and northern Rajasthan. In southern states and West Bengal the climatic conditions allow the cultivation of two or three crops of rice in an agricultural year. In West Bengal farmers grow three crops of rice called ‘</a><i>aus</i>’, ‘<i>aman</i>’ and ‘<i>boro</i>’.

About 85 per cent of total area under this crop is concentrated in north and central regions of the country i.e. Indo-Gangetic Plain, Malwa Plateau and Himalayas up to 2,700 m altitude.

Leading producers of </a><i>bajra </i>are the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Being a rainfed crop, the yield level of this crop is low in Rajasthan and fluctuates a lot from year to year.

At present, India produces about three-fifth of jute production of the world. West Bengal accounts for about three-fourth of the production in the country. Bihar and Assam are other jute growing areas. Being concentrated only in a few states, this crop accounts for only about 0.5 per cent of total cropped area in the country.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8967">Other Crops</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13190">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8968">Sugarcane, tea and coffee are other important crops grown in India.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8969">Sugarcane</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_548.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_549.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark8970">Sugarcane is a crop of tropical areas.

It is grown over undulating topography of hilly areas and well- drained soils in humid and sub-humid tropics and sub-tropics. In India, tea plantation started in 1840s in Brahmaputra valley of Assam which still is a major tea growing area in the country. Later on, its plantation was introduced in the sub-Himalayan region of West Bengal (Darjiling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Bihar districts).
