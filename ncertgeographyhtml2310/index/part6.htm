You are well aware that it has moved and moves vertically and horizontally. Of course, it moved a bit faster in the past than the rate at which it is moving now. The differences in the internal forces operating from within the earth which built up the crust have been responsible for the variations in the outer surface of the crust. The earth’s surface is being continuously subjected to external forces induced basically by energy (sunlight). Of course, the internal forces are still active though with different intensities. That means, the earth’s surface is being continuously subjected to by external forces originating within the earth’s atmosphere and by internal forces from within the earth. The external forces are known as </a><i>exogenic forces </i>and the internal forces are known as <i>endogenic forces. </i>The actions of exogenic forces result in wearing down (degradation) of relief/elevations and filling up (aggradation) of basins/depressions, on the earth’s surface. The phenomenon of wearing down of relief variations of the surface of the earth through erosion is known as <i>gradation. </i>The endogenic<a class="s216" name="bookmark881">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">as long as the opposing actions of exogenic and endogenic forces continue. In general terms, the endogenic forces are mainly land building forces and the exogenic processes are mainly land wearing forces. The surface of the earth is sensitive. Humans depend on it for their sustenance and have been using it extensively and intensively. So, it is essential to understand its nature in order to use it effectively without disturbing its balance and diminishing its potential  for the future.  Almost all organisms contribute to sustain the earth’s environment. However, humans have caused over use of resources. Use we must, but must also leave it potential enough to sustain life through the future. Most of the surface of the earth had and has been shaped over very long periods of time (hundreds and thousands of years) and because of its use and misuse by humans its potential is being diminished at a fast rate. If the processes which shaped and are shaping the surface of the earth into varieties of forms (shapes) and the nature of materials of which it is composed of, are understood, precautions can be taken to minimise the detrimental effects of human use and to preserve it for posterity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s7" name="bookmark883">G</a><span class="s7">EOMORPHIC </span>P<span class="s7">ROCESSES</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark884">You would like to know the meaning of geomorphic processes.

So, gravitational stresses are as important as the other geomorphic processes. Gravity is the force that is keeping us in contact with the surface and it is the force that switches on the movement of all surface material on earth.

Forces acting along the faces of earth materials are shear stresses (separating forces). It is this stress that breaks rocks and other earth materials. The shear stresses result in angular displacement or slippage. Besides the gravitational stress earth materials become subjected to molecular stresses that may be caused by a number of factors amongst which temperature changes, crystallisation and melting are the most common. Chemical processes normally lead to loosening of bonds between grains, dissolving of soluble minerals or cementing materials. Thus, the basic reason that leads to weathering, mass movements, erosion and deposition is development of stresses in the body of the earth materials.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark904">As there are different climatic regions on the earth’s surface the exogenic geomorphic processes vary from region to region.

Oxidation occurs where there is ready access to the atmosphere and oxygenated waters. The minerals most commonly involved in this process are iron, manganese, sulphur etc. In the process of oxidation rock breakdown occurs due to the disturbance caused by addition of oxygen. Red colour of iron upon oxidation turns to brown or  yellow. When oxidised  minerals  are placed in an environment where oxygen is absent, reduction takes place. Such conditions exist usually below the water table, in areas of stagnant water and waterlogged ground. Red colour of iron upon reduction turns to greenish or bluish grey.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">Can we give iron  rusting  as  an example of oxidation?

Many of these forces are applied both at the surface and within different earth materials leading to rock fracture.

Fractures will develop roughly parallel to the ground surface. In areas of curved ground surface, arched fractures tend to produce massive sheets or exfoliation slabs of rock. Exfoliation sheets resulting from expansion due to unloading and pressure release  may measure hundreds or even thousands of metres in horizontal extent.

This process is most effective in dry climates and high elevations where diurnal temperature changes are drastic. As has been mentioned earlier though these movements are very small they make the rocks weak due to continued fatigue. The surface layers of the rocks tend to expand more than the rock at depth and this leads to the formation of stress within the rock resulting in heaving and fracturing parallel to the surface. Due to differential heating and resulting expansion and contraction of surface layers and their subsequent exfoliation from the surface results in smooth rounded surfaces in rocks.

This process is most effective at high elevations in mid-latitudes where freezing and melting is often repeated. Glacial areas are subject to frost wedging daily. In this process, the rate of freezing is important. Rapid freezing of water causes its sudden expansion and high pressure. The resulting expansion affects joints, cracks and small inter granular fractures to become wider and wider till the rock breaks apart.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark953">Salt Weathering</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark954">Salts in rocks expand due to thermal action, hydration and crystallisation. Many salts like calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium and barium have a tendency to expand. Expansion of these salts depends on temperature and their thermal properties. High temperature ranges between 30 and 50°C of surface temperatures in deserts favour such salt expansion.

Human beings by disturbing vegetation, ploughing and cultivating soils, also help in mixing and creating new contacts between air, water and minerals in the earth materials. Decaying plant and animal matter help in the production of humic, carbonic and other acids which enhance decay and solubility of some elements.

Biomes and bio­ diversity is basically a result of forests (vegetation) and forests depend upon the depth of weathering mantles. Erosion cannot be significant if the rocks are not weathered. That means, weathering aids mass wasting, erosion and reduction of relief and changes in landforms are a consequence of erosion. Weathering of rocks and deposits helps in the enrichment and concentrations of certain valuable ores of iron, manganese, aluminium, copper etc., which are of great importance for the national economy.

That means, air, water or ice do not cany debris with them from place to place but on the other hand the debris may cany with it air, water or ice. The movements of mass may range from slow to rapid, affecting shallow to deep columns of materials and include creep, flow, slide and fall. Gravity exerts its force on all matter, both bedrock and the products of weathering. So, weathering is not a pre-requisite for mass movement though it aids mass movements. Mass movements are very active over weathered slopes rather than over unweathered materials.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark968">Mass movements are aided by gravity and no geomorphic agent like running water, glaciers, wind, waves and currents participate in the process of mass movements. That means mass movements do not come under erosion though there is a shift (aided by gravity) of materials from one place to another. Materials over the slopes have their own resistance to disturbing forces and will yield only when force is greater than the shearing resistance of the materials. Weak unconsolidated materials, thinly bedded rocks, faults, steeply dipping beds, vertical cliffs or steep slopes, abundant precipitation and torrential rains and scarcity of vegetation etc., favour mass movements.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark969">Several activating causes precede mass movements.

Why? Many slopes are steeper with almost vertical cliffs and escarpments in the Western Ghats and Nilgiris. Mechanical weathering due to temperature changes and ranges is pronounced.

Hence the energy</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">available to perform work will depend on the mass of the material and the velocity with which it is moving. Obviously then you will find that though the glaciers move at very low velocities due to tremendous mass are more effective as the agents of erosion and wind, being in gaseous state, are less effective.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark997">The work of the other two agents of erosion­ waves and ground water is not controlled by climate. In case of waves it is the location along the interface of litho and hydro sphere — coastal region — that will determine the work of waves, whereas the work of ground water is determined more by the lithological character of the region. If the rocks are permeable and soluble and water is available only then karst topography develops. In the next chapter we shall be dealing with the landforms produced by each of the agents of erosion.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark998">Deposition is a consequence of erosion. The erosional agents loose their velocity and hence energy on gentler slopes and the materials carried by them start to settle themselves. In other words, deposition is not actually the work of any agent. The coarser materials get</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark999">deposited first and finer ones later. By deposition depressions get filled up. The same erosional agents viz., running water, glaciers, wind, waves and groundwater act as aggradational or depositional agents also.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">There is a shift of materials in mass movements as well as in erosion from one place to the other.

Soil is a result of decay, it is also the medium for growth. It is a changing and developing body. It has many characteristics that fluctuate with the seasons. It may be alternatively cold and warm or dry and moist. Biological activity is slowed or stopped if the soil becomes too cold or too dry. Organic matter increases when leaves fall or grasses die. The soil chemistry, the amount of organic matter, the soil flora and fauna, the temperature and the moisture, all change with the seasons as well as with more extended periods of time. That means, soil becomes adjusted to conditions of climate, landform and vegetation and will change internally when these controlling conditions change.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1007">Process of Soil Formation</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark12907">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1008">Soil formation or pedogenesis depends first on weathering.

First, the weathered material or transported deposits are colonised by bacteria and other inferior plant bodies like mosses and lichens. Also, several minor organisms may take shelter within the mantle and deposits. The dead remains of organisms and plants help in humus accumulation. Minor grasses and ferns may grow; later, bushes and trees will start growing through seeds brought in by birds and wind. Plant roots penetrate down, burrowing animals bring up particles, mass of material becomes porous and sponge­ like with a capacity to retain water and to permit the passage of air and finally a mature soil, a complex mixture of mineral and organic products forms.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">Is weathering solely responsible for soil formation?

Parent materials can be any in­ </a><i>situ </i>or on-site weathered rock debris (residual soils) or transported deposits (transported soils). Soil formation depends upon the texture (sizes of debris) and structure (disposition of individual grains/particles of debris) as well as the mineral and chemical composition of the rock debris/deposits.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1016">Nature and rate of weathering and depth of weathering mantle are important consideration under parent materials. There may be differences in soil over similar bedrock and dissimilar bedrocks may have similar soils above them. But when soils are very young and have not matured these show strong links</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1017">with the type of parent rock.

The influence of topography is felt through the amount of exposure of a surface covered by parent materials to sunlight and the amount of surface and sub-surface drainage over and through the parent materials. Soils will be thin on steep slopes and thick over flat upland areas. Over gentle slopes where erosion is slow and percolation of water is good, soil formation is very favourable. Soils over flat areas may develop a thick layer of clay with good accumulation of organic matter giving the soil dark colour. In middle latitudes, the south facing slopes exposed to sunlight have different conditions of vegetation and soils and the north facing slopes with cool, moist conditions have some other soils and vegetation.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1020">Climate</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1021">Climate is an important active factor in soil formation. The climatic elements involved in soil development are : (i) moisture in terms of its intensity, frequency and duration of precipitation - evaporation and humidity;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">(ii) temperature in terms of seasonal and diurnal variations.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1022">Precipitation gives soil its moisture content which makes the chemical and biological activities possible. Excess of water helps in the downward transportation of soil components through the soil (eluviation) and deposits the same down below (illuviation). In climates like wet equatorial rainy areas with high rainfall, not only calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium etc. but also a major part of silica is removed from the soil. Removal of silica from the soil is known as </a><i>desilication. </i>In dry climates, because of high temperature, evaporation exceeds precipitation and hence ground water is brought up to the surface by capillary action and in the process the water evaporates leaving behind salts in the soil. Such salts form into a crust in the soil known as hardpans. In tropical</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1023">climates and in areas with intermediate precipitation conditions, calcium carbonate nodules </a><i>(kanker) </i>are formed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1024">Temperature acts in two ways — increasing or reducing chemical and biological activity. Chemical activity is increased in higher temperatures, reduced in cooler temperatures (with an exception of carbonation) and stops in freezing conditions. That is why, tropical soils with higher temperatures show deeper profiles and in the frozen tundra regions soils contain largely mechanically broken materials.</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1025">Biological Activity</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1026">The vegetative cover and organisms that occupy the parent materials from the beginning and also at later stages help in adding organic matter, moisture retention, nitrogen etc. Dead plants provide humus, the finely divided organic matter of the soil. Some organic acids which form during humification aid in decomposing the minerals of the soil parent materials.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1027">Intensity of bacterial activity shows up differences between soils of cold and warm climates. Humus accumulates in cold climates as bacterial growth is slow. With undecomposed organic matter because of low bacterial activity, layers of peat develop in sub-arctic and tundra climates. In humid tropical and equatorial climates, bacterial growth and action is intense and dead vegetation is rapidly oxidised leaving very low humus content in  the  soil. Further, bacteria and other soil organisms take gaseous nitrogen from the air and convert it into a chemical form that can be used by plants. This process is known as nitrogen fixation. Rhizobium, a type of bacteria, lives in the root nodules of leguminous plants and fixes nitrogen beneficial to the host plant. The influence of large animals like ants, termites, earthworms, rodents etc., is mechanical, but, it is nevertheless important in soil formation as they rework the soil up and down. In case of earthworms, as they feed on soil, the texture and chemistry of the soil that comes out of their body changes.</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1028">Time</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark1029">Time is the third important controlling factor in soil formation.
