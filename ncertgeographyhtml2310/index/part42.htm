People located in very cold and extremely hot climates survived on hunting. The people in the coastal areas still catch fish though fishing has experienced modernisation due to technological progress. Many species, now have become extinct or endangered due to illegal hunting (poaching). The early hunters used primitive tools made of stones, twigs or arrows so the number of animals killed was limited. Why has hunting been banned in India?</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_274.png"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 301pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5251">Gathering and hunting are the oldest economic activity known.

Gatherers collect valuable plants such as leaves, barks of trees and medicinal plants and after simple processing sell the products in the market. They use various parts of the plants, for example, the bark is used for quinine, tanin extract and corkâ€” leaves supply materials for beverages, drugs, cosmetics, fibres, thatch and fabrics; nuts for food and oils and tree trunk yield rubber, balata, gums and resins.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark5258">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_276.jpg"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5259">Gathering has little chance of becoming important at the global level.

People living in different climatic conditions selected and domesticated animals found in those regions. Depending on the geographical factors, and technological development, animal rearing today is practised either at the subsistence or at the commercial level.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s57" style="padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5266">Nomadic herding or pastoral nomadism is a primitive subsistence activity, in which the herders rely on animals for food, clothing, shelter, tools and transport. They move from one place to another along with their livestock, depending on the amount and quality of pastures and water. Each nomadic community occupies a well-identified territory as a matter of tradition.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_279.jpg"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s67" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent:  +0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5267">Fig. 5.3: Nomads taking their sheep up to the Mountains at the onset of summer</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark5268">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5269">A wide variety of animals is kept in different regions. In tropical Africa, cattle are the most important livestock, while in Sahara and Asiatic deserts, sheep, goats and camel are reared. In the mountainous areas of Tibet and Andes, yak and llamas and in the Arctic and sub Arctic areas, reindeer are the most important animals.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5270">Pastoral nomadism is associated with three important regions. The core region extends from the Atlantic shores of North Africa eastwards across the Arabian peninsula into Mongolia and Central China. The second region extends  over  the tundra  region  of Eurasia.  In the southern hemisphere there are small areas in South-west Africa and on the island of Madagascar (Fig. 5.4)</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5271">Movement in search of pastures is undertaken either over vast horizontal distances or vertically from one elevation to another in the mountainous regions. The process of migration from plain areas to pastures on mountains during summers and again from mountain pastures to plain areas during winters is known as </a><i>transhumance. </i>In mountain regions, such as Himalayas, Gujjars, Bakarwals, Gaddis and Bhotiyas migrate from plains to the mountains in summers and to the plains from the high altitude pastures in winters. Similarly, in the tundra regions, the nomadic herders move from south to north in summers and from north to south in winters.</p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5272">The number of pastoral nomads has been decreasing and the areas operated by them shrinking. This is due to (a) imposition of political boundaries; (b) new settlement plans by different countries.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5273">Commercial Livestock Rearing</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5274">Unlike nomadic herding, commercial livestock rearing is more organised and capital intensive. Commercial livestock ranching is essentially associated with western cultures and is practised on permanent ranches. These ranches cover large areas and are divided into a number of parcels, which are fenced to regulate the grazing. When the grass of one parcel is grazed, animals are moved to another parcel. The number of animals in a pasture is kept according to the carrying capacity of the pasture.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_280.png"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5275">This is a specialised activity in which only one type of animal is reared.
