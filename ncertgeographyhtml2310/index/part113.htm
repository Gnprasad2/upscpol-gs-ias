On the basis of size, capital investment and labour force employed, industries are classified as large, medium, small scale, and cottage industries. On the basis of ownership, industries are categorised as :</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 302pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) public sector, (ii) private sector, and (iii) joint and cooperative sector, Public sector enterprises are government/state controlled companies or corporations funded by governments. Industries of strategic and national importance are usually in the public sector. Industries are also classified on the basis of the use of their products such as :</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 302pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) basic goods industries, (ii) capital goods industries (iii) intermediate goods industries, and (iv) consumer goods industries.</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 301pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9466">Another method of classifying industries is on the basis of raw materials used by them. Accordingly, these can be : (i) agriculture­ based industries, (ii) forest-based industries,</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 302pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) mineral-based industries, and</p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 302pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">(iv) industrially processed raw material­ based industries.</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 302pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9467">Another common classification of industries is based on the nature of the manufactured products. Eight classes of industries, thus identified are : (1) Metallurgical Industries, (2) Mechanical Engineering Industries, (3) Chemical and Allied Industries,</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 302pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">(4) Textile Industries, (5) Food Processing Industries, (6) Electricity Generation,</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 302pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">(7) Electronics and (8) Communication Industries. Sometimes, you also read about foot loose industries. What are these? Have they any relationship with raw material location or not?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9469">Can you guess the reasons for the location of iron and steel industry in eastern and southern India? Why is there no iron and steel industry in U.P., Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat?</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9470">Location of industries is influenced by several factors like access to raw materials, power, market, capital, transport and labour, etc. Relative significance of these factors varies with time and place. There is strong relationship between raw  material and  type  of  industry. It is economical to locate the manufacturing industries at a place where cost of production and delivery cost of manufactured goods to consumers are the least. Transport costs, to a great extent, depend on the nature of raw materials and manufactured products. A brief description of factors influencing the location of industries are given below:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9471">Raw Materials</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13224">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_620.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9472">Industries using weight-losing raw materials are located in the regions where raw materials are located. Why are the sugar mills in India located in sugarcane growing areas? Similarly, the locations of pulp industry, copper smelting and pig iron industries are located near their raw materials. In iron and steel industries, iron ore and coal both are weight-losing raw materials. Therefore, an optimum location for iron and steel industries should be near raw material sources. This is why most of the iron and steel industries are located either near coalfields (Bokaro, Durgapur, etc.) or near sources of iron ore (Bhadravati, Bhilai, and Rourkela). Similarly, industries based on perishable raw materials are also located close to raw material sources.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9474">Markets provide the outlets for manufactured products. Heavy machine, machine tools, heavy chemicals are located near the high demand areas as these are market orientated. Cotton textile industry uses a non-weight-losing raw material and is generally located in large urban centre,</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">e.g. Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat, etc. Petroleum refineries are also located near the markets as the transport of crude oil is easier and several products derived from them are used as raw material in other industries. Koyali, Mathura and Barauni refineries are typical examples. Ports also play a crucial role in the location of oil refineries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9475">Transport</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13225">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9476">Have you ever tried to find out the reasons for the concentration of industries in Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and in and around Kolkata? It was due to the fact that they initially became the nodal point having transport links. The industries shifted to interior locations, only when railway lines were laid. All major industrial plants are located on the trunk rail routes.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13226">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9477">Labour</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9478">Can we think of an industry without labour? Industries require skilled labour. In India, labour is quite mobile and is available in large numbers due to our large population.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9479">Historical Factors</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13227">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9473">Have you ever thought of the reasons for emerging Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai as industrial nodes? These locations were greatly influenced by our colonial past. During the initial phase of colonisation, manufacturing activities received new impetus provided by the European traders. Places like Murshidabad, Dhaka, Bhadohi, Surat, Vadodara, Kozhikode, Coimbatore, Mysore, etc. emerged as important manufacturing centres. In the subsequent industrial phase of colonialism, these manufacturing centres experienced rapid growth due to competition from the goods manufactured in Britain and the discriminatory policies of colonial power.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9480">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_621.png"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9481">In the last phase of colonialism, the British promoted few industries in selected areas. This led to larger spatial coverage by different types of industries in the country.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9492">&zwnj;</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9491">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9482">Industrial Policy</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13228">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9483">India, being a democratic country aims at bringing about economic growth with balanced regional development.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9484">Establishment of iron and steel industry in Bhilai and Rourkela were based on decision to develop backward tribal areas of the country.
