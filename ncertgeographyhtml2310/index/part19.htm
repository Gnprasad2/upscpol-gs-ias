The climate of India has many regional variations expressed in the pattern of winds, temperature and rainfall, rhythm of seasons and the degree of wetness or dryness. These regional diversities may be described as sub-types of monsoon climate. Let us take a closer look at these regional variations in temperature, winds and rainfall.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2939">While in the summer the mercury occasionally touches 55°C in the western Rajasthan, it drops down to as low as minus 45°C in winter around Leh. Churn in Rajasthan may record a temperature of 50°C or more on a June day while the mercury hardly touches 19°C in Tawang (Arunachal Pradesh) on the same day. On a December night, temperature in Drass (Jammu and Kashmir) may drop down to minus 45°C while Tiruvanantapuram or Chennai on the same night records 20°C or 22°C. These examples confirm that there are seasonal variations in temperature from place to place and from region to region in India. Not only this, if we take only a single place and record the temperature for just one day, variations are no less striking. In Kerala and in the Andaman Islands, the difference between day and night temperatures may be hardly seven or eight degree Celsius. But in the Thar desert, if the day temperature is around 50°C, at night, it may drop down considerably upto 15°-20°C.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2940">Now, let us see the regional variations in precipitation. While snowfall occurs in the Himalayas, it only rains over the rest of the country. Similarly, variations are noticeable not only in the type of precipitation but also in its amount. While Cherrapunji and Mawsynram in the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya receive rainfall over 1,080 cm in a year, Jaisalmer in Rajasthan rarely gets more than 9 cm of rainfall during the same period.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2941">Tura situated in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya may receive an amount of rainfall in a single day which is equal to 10 years of rainfall at Jaisalmer. While the annual precipitation is less than 10 cm in the north­ west Himalayas and the western deserts, it exceeds 400 cm in Meghalaya.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2942">The Ganga delta and the coastal plains of Orissa are hit by strong rain-bearing storms almost every third or fifth day in July and August while the Coromandal coast, a thousand km to the south, goes generally dry during these months.

A high pressure centre in the region lying to the north of the Himalayas develops during winter. This centre of high pressure gives rise to the flow of air at the low level from the north towards the Indian subcontinent, south of the mountain range. The surface winds blowing out of the high pressure centre over Central Asia reach India in the form of a dry continental air mass. These continental winds come in contact with trade winds over northwestern India. The position of this contact zone is not, however, stable. Occasionally, it may shift its position as far east as the middle Ganga valley with the result that the whole of the northwestern and northern India up to the middle Ganga valley comes under the influence of dry northwestern winds.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2965">Jet Stream and Upper Air Circulation : </a><span class="p">The pattern of air circulation discussed above is witnessed only at the lower level of the atmosphere near the surface of the earth.

The variations in the atmospheric pressure closer to the surface of the earth have no role to play in the making of upper air circulation. All of Western and Central Asia remains under the influence of westerly winds along the altitude of 9-13 km from west to east. These winds blow across the Asian continent at latitudes north of the Himalayas roughly parallel to the Tibetan highlands (Figure 4.1). These are known as jet streams. Tibetan highlands act as a barrier in the path of these jet streams. As a result, jet streams get bifurcated. One of its branches blows to the north of the Tibetan highlands, while the southern branch blows in an eastward direction, south of the Himalayas. It has its mean position at 25°N in February at 200-300 mb level. It is believed that this southern branch of the jet stream exercises an important influence on the winter weather in India.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_156.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 1pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2967">Western Cyclonic Disturbance and Tropical Cyclones : </a><span class="p">The western cyclonic disturbances which enter the Indian subcontinent from the west and the northwest during the winter months, originate over the Mediterranean Sea and are</span><a class="s216" name="bookmark2968">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2969">brought into India by the westerly jet stream.

In fact, meteorologists have found an interrelationship between the northward shift of the equatorial trough (ITCZ) and the withdrawal of the westerly jet stream from over the North Indian Plain. It is generally believed that there is a cause and effect relationship between the two. The ITCZ being a zone of low pressure, attracts inflow of winds from different directions. The maritime tropical airmass (mT) from the southern hemisphere, after crossing the equator, rushes to the low pressure area in the general southwesterly direction.

This monsoon  trough  encourages  the  development  of  thermal  low  over north and northwest India. Due to the shift of ITCZ, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere cross the equator between 40° and 60°E longitudes and start blowing from southwest to northeast due to the Coriolis force. It becomes southwest monsoon. In winter,    the ITCZ moves southward, and so the reversal of winds from northeast to south and  southwest, takes place.

This causes the formation of an intense low pressure in the northwestern part of the subcontinent.

Roughly, this elongated low pressure monsoon trough extends over the Thar desert in the north-west to Patna and Chotanagpur plateau in the east-southeast  (Figure 4.9). The location of the ITCZ attracts a surface circulation of the winds which are southwesterly on the west coast as well as along the coast of West Bengal and Bangladesh. They are easterly or south­ easterly over north Bengal and Bihar. It has been discussed earlier that these currents of southwesterly monsoon are in reality ‘displaced’ equatorial westerlies.

Dust storms in the evening are very common during May in Punjab, Haryana, Eastern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. These temporary storms bring a welcome respite from the oppressing heat since they bring with them light rains and a pleasant cool breeze. Occasionally, the moisture-laden winds are attracted towards the periphery of the trough. A sudden contact between dry and moist air masses gives rise to local storms of great intensity.

These winds climb the slopes of the Western Ghats from 900-1200 m. Soon, they become cool, and as a result, the windward side of the Sahyadris and Western Coastal Plain receive very heavy rainfall ranging between 250 cm and 400 cm. After crossing the Western Ghats, these winds descend and get heated up. This reduces humidity in the winds. As a result, these winds cause little rainfall east of the Western Ghats. This region of low rainfall is  known as the rain-shadow area. Find out the rainfall at Kozhikode, Mangalore, Pune and Bangalore and note the difference (Figure 4.10).</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent:  +0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3081">(ii) Another branch of the Arabian sea monsoon strikes the coast north of Mumbai. Moving along the Narmada and Tapi river valleys, these winds cause rainfall in extensive areas of central India. The Chotanagpur plateau gets 15 cm rainfall from this part of the branch. Thereafter, they enter the Ganga plains and mingle with the Bay of Bengal branch.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13630">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent:  +0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3082">(iii) A third branch of this monsoon wind strikes the Saurashtra Peninsula and the Kachchh.

But the Arakan Hills along the coast of Myanmar deflect a big portion of this branch towards the Indian subcontinent. The monsoon, therefore, enters West Bengal and Bangladesh from south and southeast instead of from the south-westerly direction. From here, this branch splits into two under the influence of the Himalayas and the thermal low is northwest India. Its one branch moves westward along the Ganga plains reaching as far as the Punjab plains. The other branch moves up the Brahmaputra valley in the north and the northeast, causing widespread rains. Its sub-branch strikes the Garo and Khasi hills of Meghalaya. Mawsynram, located on the crest of Khasi hills, receives the highest average annual rainfall in the world.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3087">Here it is important to know why the Tamil Nadu coast remains dry during this season.

For instance the windward side of the Western Ghats register a rainfall of over 250 cm. Again, the heavy rainfall in the northeastern states can be attributed to their hill ranges and the Eastern Himalayas.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark3094">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark3096"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_165.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></a><a class="s216" name="bookmark3095">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent:  +0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3097">(iii) The monsoon rainfall has a declining trend with increasing distance from the sea.

The wet spells are interspersed with rainless interval known as ‘breaks’. These breaks in rainfall are related to the cyclonic depressions mainly formed at the head of the Bay of Bengal, and their crossing into the mainland. Besides the frequency and intensity of these depressions, the passage followed by them determines the spatial distribution of rainfall.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13635">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent:  +0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark13636">(v) The summer rainfall comes in a heavy downpour leading to considerable run off and soil erosion.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13637">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent:  +0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark13638">(vi) Monsoons play a pivotal role in the agrarian economy of India because over three-fourths of the total rain in the country is received during the south­ west monsoon season.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13639">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent:  +0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark13640">(vii) Its spatial distribution is also uneven which ranges from 12 cm to more than 250 cm.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13641">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent:  +0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark13642">(viii) The beginning of the rains sometimes is considerably delayed over the whole or a part of the country.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13643">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent:  +0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark13644">(ix) The rains sometimes end considerably earlier than usual, causing great damage to standing crops and making the sowing of winter crops difficult.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13645">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3098">Season of Retreating Monsoon</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13016">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3099">The months of October and November are known for retreating monsoons. By the end of September, the southwest monsoon becomes weak as the low pressure trough of the Ganga plain starts moving southward in response to the southward march of the sun. The monsoon retreats from the western Rajasthan by the first week of September. It withdraws from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Western Ganga plain and the Central Highlands by the end of the month. By the beginning of October, the low pressure covers northern parts of the Bay of Bengal and by early November, it moves</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3100">over Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

The land is still moist. Owing to the conditions of high temperature and humidity, the weather becomes rather oppressive. This is commonly known as the ‘October heat’. In the second half of October, the mercury begins to fall rapidly, particularly in northern India. The weather in the retreating monsoon is dry in north India but it is associated with rain in the eastern part of the Peninsula. Here, October and November are the rainiest months of the year.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark3102">The widespread rain in this season is associated with the passage of cyclonic depressions which originate over the Andaman Sea and manage to cross the eastern coast of the southern Peninsula. These tropical cyclones are very destructive. The thickly populated deltas of the Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri are their preferred targets. Every year cyclones bring disaster here. A few cyclonic storms also strike the coast of West Bengal, Bangladesh and Myanmar. A bulk of the rainfall of the Coromondal coast is derived from these depressions and cyclones. Such cyclonic storms are less frequent in the Arabian Sea.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s7" name="bookmark3103">T</a><span class="s7">RADITIONAL </span>I<span class="s7">NDIAN </span>S<span class="s7">EASONS</span></p><div class="search-table-outter wrapper">

It is on this basis that the climatic regions can be identified. A climatic region has a homogeneous climatic condition which is the result of a combination of factors. Temperature and rainfall are two important elements which are considered to be decisive in all the schemes of climatic classification. The classification of climate, however, is a complex exercise.
