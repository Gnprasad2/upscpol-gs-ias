You must have used it with reference to preparation for your examination or visit to a hill station. It involves the process of thinking, formulation of a scheme or programme  and implementation  of a set of actions to achieve some goal. Though it is a very broad term, in this chapter, it has been used with reference to the process of economic development.

It is a statutory body headed by the Prime Minister and has a Deputy Chairman and members. The planning in the country is largely carried out through Five Year Plans.</a></p><p class="s142" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9671">The First Five Year Plan was launched in 1951 and covered the period, 1951-52 to 1955-56. Second and Third Five Year Plans covered the period from 1956-57 to 1960-61 and 1961-62 to 1965-66 respectively.

This period was covered by annual plans, which are also termed as rolling plans. The Fourth Five Year Plan began in 1969-70 and ended in 1973-74. Following this the Fifth Five Year Plan began in 1974-75 but it was terminated by the then government one year earlier i.e. in 1977-78. The Sixth Five Year Plan took off in 1980. The Seventh Five Year Plan covered the period between 1985 and 1990. Once again due to the political instability and initiation of liberalisation policy, the Eighth Five Year Plan got delayed. It covered the period, 1992 to 1997. The Ninth  Five  Year  Plan covered the period from 1997 to 2002. The Tenth Plan began in 2002 and it is still in progress. It will come to an end on 31.3.2007. The approach paper of the Eleventh Plan entitled. “Towards Faster and More Inclusive Growth” has already been approved.</p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9672">reforms and reconstruction are often undertaken. Generally, there are two approaches to planning, i.e. sectoral planning and regional planning. The sectoral planning means formulation and implementation of the sets of schemes or programmes aimed at development of various sectors of the economy such as agriculture, irrigation, manufacturing, power, construction, transport, communication, social infrastructure and services.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9683">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9673">There is no uniform economic development over space in any country. Some areas are more developed and some lag behind. This uneven pattern of development over space necessitates that the planners have a spatial perspective and draw the plans to reduce regional imbalance in development. This type of planning is termed as regional planning.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9674">Target Area Planning</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13243">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9675">The planning process has to take special care of those areas which have remained economically backward. As you know, the economic development of a region depends upon its resource base. But sometimes resource-rich region also remain backward. The economic development also requires technology as well as investment besides the resource. With the planning experience of about one and half decades, it was realised that regional imbalances in economic development were getting accentuated. In order to arrest the accentuation of regional and social disparties, the Planning Commission introduced the ‘</a><i>target area’ </i>and <i>target group </i>approaches to planning. Some of the examples of programmes directed towards the development of target areas are <i>Command Area Development Programme, Drought Prone Area Development Programme, Desert Development Programme, Hill Area Development Programme. The Small Farmers Development Agency (SFDA) and Marginal Farmers Development Agency (MFDA) </i>which are the examples of target group programme.</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9676">In the 8th Five year Plan special area programmes were designed to develop infrastructure in hill areas, north-eastern states, tribal areas and backward areas.</a></p><p class="s167" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9677">Hill Area Development Programme</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13244">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9678">Hill Area Development Programmes were initiated during Fifth Five Year Plan covering 15 districts comprising all the hilly districts of Uttar Pradesh (present Uttaranchal), Mikir Hill and North Cachar hills of Assam, Darjiling district of West Bengal and Nilgiri district of Tamil Nadu. The National Committee on the Development of Backward Area in 1981 recommended that all the hill areas in the country having height above 600 m and not covered under tribal sub-plan be treated as backward hill areas.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9679">The detailed plans for the development of hill areas were drawn keeping in view their topographical, ecological, social and economic conditions.

It has been observed that this programme is largely confined to the development of agriculture and allied sectors with major focus on restoration of ecological balance. Since growing population pressure is forcing the society to utilise the marginal lands for agriculture, and, thereby causing ecological degradation, there is a need to create alternative employment opportunities in the drought- prone areas. The other strategies of development of these areas include adoption of integrated watershed development approach at the micro-level.

Under the Fifth Five Year Plan, the tribal sub-plan was introduced in 1974 and Bharmaur was designated as one of the five Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDP) in Himachal</p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9697">Pradesh. This area development plan was aimed at improving the quality of life of the </a><i>Gaddis </i>and narrowing the gap in the level of development between Bharmaur and other areas of Himachal Pradesh.

The female literary rate in the region increased from 1.88 per cent in 1971 to 42.83 per cent in 2001. The difference between males and females in literacy level i.e. gender inequality, has also declined. Traditionally, the </a><i>Gaddis </i>had subsistence agricultural-cum- pastoral economy having emphasis on foodgrains and livestock production. But during the last three decades of twentieth century, the cultivation of pulses and other cash crops has increased in Bharmaur region. But the crop cultivation is still done with traditional technology. The declining importance of pastoralism in the economy of the region can be gauged from the fact that at present only about one-tenth of the total households practise transhumance. But the <i>Gaddis </i>are still very mobile as a sizeable section of them migrate to Kangra and surrounding areas during winter to earn their livings from wage labour.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part116.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part118.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script></body></html>
