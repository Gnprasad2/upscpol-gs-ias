The plant was located on the basis of proximity to raw materials, thus, minimising the cost of transporting weight losing raw material. This plant has a unique locational advantage, as it receives coal from Jharia (Jharkhand) and iron ore from Sundargarh and Kendujhar.

In the ancient and the medieval times, it used to be only a cottage industry. India was famous worldwide for the production of muslin, a very fine variety of cotton cloth, calicos, chintz and other different varieties of fine cotton cloth. The development of this industry in India was due to several factors. One, it is a tropical country and cotton is the most comfortable fabric for a hot and humid climate. Second, large quantity of cotton was grown in India. Abundant skilled labour required for this industry was available in this country. In fact, in some areas the people were producing cotton textiles for generations and transferred the skill from one generation to the other and in the process perfected their skills.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9517">Initially, the British did not encourage the development of the indigenous cotton textile industry. They exported raw cotton to their mills in Manchester and Liverpool and brought back the finished products to be sold in India. This cloth was cheaper because it was produced at mass scale in factories in U.K. as compared to the cottage based industries of India.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9518">In 1854, the first modern cotton mill was established in Mumbai.

It was very close to the cotton producing areas of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Raw cotton used to be brought to Mumbai port to be transported to England. Therefore, cotton was available in Mumbai city itself. Moreover, Mumbai even then was the financial centre and the capital needed to start an industry was available there. As a large town, providing employment opportunities attracted labour in large numbers. Hence, cheap and abundant labour too was available locally.

Subsequently, two more mills, the Shahpur Mill and the Calico Mill were established in Ahmedabad. By 1947, the number of mills in India went up to 423 but the scenario changed after partition, and this industry suffered a major recession. This was due to the fact that the most of the good quality cotton growing areas had gone to West Pakistan and India was left with 409 mills and only 29 per cent of the cotton producing area.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9536">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9528">After Independence, this industry gradually recovered and eventually flourished. In 1998, India had 1782 mills; of which, 192 mills were in the public sector and 151 mills in the cooperative sector. The largest number, that is, 1,439 mills were in the private sector.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9529">The cotton textile industry in India can be broadly divided into two sectors, the organised sector and the decentralised sector. The decentralised sector includes cloth produced in handlooms (including </a><i>Khadi</i>) and powerlooms. The production of the organised sector has drastically fallen from 81 per cent in the mid-twentieth century to only about 6 per cent in 2000. At present, the powerlooms on the decentralised sector produce more than 59 per cent and the handloom sector produces about 19 per cent of all cotton cloth produced in the country.</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9530">Cotton is a “pure” raw material which does not lose weight in the manufacturing process. so other factors, like, power to drive the looms, labour, capital or market may determine the location of the industry. At present the trend is to locate the industry at or close to markets, as it is the market that decides what kind of cloth is to be produced. Also the market for the finished products is extremely variable, therefore, it becomes important to locate the mills close to the market.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9531">After the first mills were set up in Mumbai and Ahmedabad in the second half of the nineteenth century, the cotton textile industry expanded very rapidly. The number of units increased dramatically. The </a><i>Swadeshi </i>movement gave a major impetus to the industry as there was a call for boycotting all British made goods in favour of Indian goods. After 1921, with the development of the railway network other cotton textile centres expanded</p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9532">rapidly. In southern India, mills were set up at Coimbatore, Madurai and Bangalore. In central India, Nagpur, Indore, Solapur and Vadodara became cotton textile centres. Cotton textile mills were set up at Kanpur based on local investment. Mills were also set up at Kolkata due to its port facilities. The development of hydro-electricity also favoured the location of the cotton textile mills away from the cotton producing areas. The rapid development of this industry in Tamil Nadu is the result of the abundant availability of hydel power for the mills. Lower labour costs at centres like Ujjain, Bharuch, Agra, Hathras, Coimbatore and Tirunelveli also caused industries to be located away from cotton producing areas.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9533">Thus, the cotton textile industry is located in almost every state in India, where one or more of the locational factors have been favourable. The importance of raw materials has given way to market or to a cheaper local labour force or it may be the availability of power.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9534">Presently, the major centres of the cotton textile industry are Ahmedabad, Bhiwandi, Solapur, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Indore and Ujjain. All these centres are the traditional centres and are located close to the cotton producing regions. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are the leading cotton producing states. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Punjab are the other important cotton textile producers.

Chennai, Madurai, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Thanjavur, Ramanathapuram and Salem are the other important centres. In Karnataka, the cotton textile industry has developed in the cotton producing areas in the north-eastern part of the state. Davangere, Hubli, Bellary, Mysore and Bangalore are important centres. In Andhra Pradesh, the cotton textile industry is located in the cotton producing Telengana region, where most of the mills are spinning mills producing yarn. The important centres are Hyderabad, Secunderabad, Warangal and Guntur.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9539">In Uttar Pradesh, Kanpur is the largest centre.

India is the largest producer of both sugarcane and cane sugar and contributes about 8 per cent of the total sugar production in the world. Besides, </a><i>khandasari </i>and <i>gur </i>or jaggery are also prepared from sugarcane. This industry provides employment for more than 4 lakh persons directly and a large number of farmers indirectly.

The ratio of sugar to sugarcane varies between 9 to 12 per cent depending on its variety. Its sucrose content begins to dry during haulage after it has been harvested from the field. Better recovery of sugar is dependent upon its being crushed within 24 hours of its harvesting. Sugar factories hence, are located within the cane producing regions.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_632.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9537">Maharashtra has emerged as a leading sugar producer in the country and produces more than one-third of the total production of the sugar in the country.

Sugar mills are located in the cane growing tracts of Surat, Junagarh, Rajkot, Amreli, Valsad and Bhavnagar districts.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s167" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9551">Petrochemical Industries</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13234">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9552">This group of industries has been growing very fast in India. A variety of products come under this category of industries. In 1960s, demand for organic chemicals increased so fast that it became difficult to meet this demand. At that time, petroleum refining industry expanded rapidly. Many items are derived from crude petroleum, which provide raw materials for many new industries, these are collectively</a></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark9559"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_633.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9553">known as petrochemical industries. This group of industries is divided into four sub-groups:</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9560">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">(i) polymers, (ii) synthetic fibres, (iii) elastomers, and (iv) surfactant intermediate. Mumbai is the hub of the petrochemical industries. Cracker units are also located in Auraiya (Uttar Pradesh), Jamnagar, Gandhinagar and Hajira (Gujarat), Nagothane, Ratnagiri (Maharashtra), Haldia (West Bengal) and Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh).</p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9554">Three organisations are working in the petrochemical sector under the administrative control of the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals. First is the Indian Petrochemical Corporation Limited (IPCL), a public sector undertaking. It is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of the various petrochemicals like polymers, chemicals, fibres and fibre intermediates. Second is the Petrofils Cooperative Limited (PCL), a joint venture of the Government of India and Weaver’s Cooperative Societies. It produces polyester filament yarn and nylon chips at its two plants located at Vadodara and Naldhari in Gujarat. Third is the Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology (CIPET), involved in imparting training in petro-chemical industry.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9555">Polymers are made from ethylene and propylene. These materials are obtained in the process of refining crude oil. Polymers are used</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9556">as raw materials in the plastic industry. Among polymers, polyethylene is a widely used thermoplastic. Plastic is first converted into sheets, powder, resin and pellets, and then used in manufacturing plastic products. Plastic products are preferred because of their strength, flexibility, water and chemical resistance and low prices. Production of plastic polymers started in India in the late fifties and the early sixties using other organic chemicals. The National Organic Chemicals Industries Limited (NOCIL), established in private sector in 1961, started the first naphtha based chemical industry in Mumbai. Later, several other companies were formed. The plants located at Mumbai, Barauni, Mettur, Pimpri and Rishra are the major producers of plastic materials.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9557">About 75 per cent of these units are in small scale sector. The industry also uses recycled plastics, which constitutes about 30 per cent of the total production.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_634.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9558">Synthetic fibres are widely used in the manufacturing of fabrics because of their inherent strength, durability, washability, and resistance to shrinkage. Industries manufacturing nylon and polyester yarns are located at Kota, Pimpri, Mumbai, Modinagar, Pune, Ujjain, Nagpur and Udhna. Acrylic staple fibre is manufactured at Kota and Vadodara.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9561">Though plastics have become inseparable items in our daily use and they have affected our life style. But due to its non-biodegradable quality it has emerged as the greatest threat to our environment. Hence, use of plastic is being discouraged in different states of India. Do you know how does plastic adversely affect our environment?</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13235">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part113.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part115.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script></body></html>
