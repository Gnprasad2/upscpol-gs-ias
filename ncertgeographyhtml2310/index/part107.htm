Water gets polluted by foreign matters such as micro­ organisms, chemicals, industrial and other wastes. Such matters deteriorate the quality of water and render it unfit for human use. When toxic substances enter lakes, steams, rivers, ocean and other water bodies, they get dissolved or lie suspended in water. This results in pollution of water whereby quality of water deteriorates affecting aquatic systems. Sometimes, these pollutants also seep down and pollute groundwater. The Ganga and the Yamuna are the two highly polluted rivers in the country.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_577.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9226">Since there is a declining availability of fresh water and increasing demand, the need has arisen to conserve and effectively manage this precious life giving resource for sustainable development. Given that water availability from sea/ocean, due to high cost  of  desalinisation, is considered negligible, India has to take quick steps and make effective policies and laws, and adopt effective measures for its conservation. Besides developing water saving technologies and methods, attempts are also to be made to prevent the pollution. There is need to encourage watershed development, rainwater harvesting, water recycling and reuse, and conjunctive use of water for sustaining water supply in long run.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9229">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_578.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s167" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9230">Prevention of Water Pollution</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9236">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_579.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9231">Available water resources are degrading rapidly. The major rivers of the country generally retain better water quality in less densely populated upper stretches in hilly areas. In plains, river water is used intensively for irrigation, drinking, domestic and industrial purposes. The drains carrying agricultural (fertilisers and insecticides), domestic (solid and liquid wastes), and industrial effluents join the rivers. The concentration of pollutants in rivers, especially remains very high during the summer season when flow of water is low.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9232">The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in collaboration with State Pollution Control Boards has been monitoring water quality of national aquatic resources at 507 stations.

The Yamuna river is the most polluted river in the country between Delhi and Etawah. Other severely polluted rivers are: the Sabarmati at Ahmedabad, the Gomti at Lucknow, the Kali, the Adyar, the Cooum (entire stretches), the Vaigai at Madurai and the Musi of Hyderabad and the Ganga at Kanpur and Varanasi. Groundwater pollution has occurred due to high concentrations of heavy/toxic metals, fluoride and nitrates at different parts of the country.</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9235">The legislative provisions such as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, and Environment Protection Act 1986 have not been implemented effectively. The result is that in 1997, 251 polluting industries were located</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9237">along the rivers and lakes. The Water Cess Act, 1977, meant to reduce pollution has also made marginal impacts. There is a strong need to generate public awareness about importance of water and impacts of water pollution. The public awareness and  action can  be  very  effective in reducing the pollutants from agricultural activities, domestic and industrial discharges.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark9253">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s167" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9238">Recycle and Reuse of Water</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark13209">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9239">Another way through which we can improve fresh water availability is by recycle and reuse. Use of water of lesser quality such as reclaimed waste-water would be an attractive option for industries for cooling and fire fighting to reduce their water cost. Similarly, in urban areas water after bathing and washing utensils can be used for  gardening.  Water used for washing vehicle can also be used for gardening. This would conserve better quality of water for drinking</a></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark9247">The Central and State Governments have initiated many watershed development and management programmes in the country. Some of these are being implemented by non­ governmental organisations also. </a><i><b>Haryali </b></i>is a watershed development project sponsored by the Central Government which aims at enabling the rural population to conserve water for drinking, irrigation, fisheries  and afforestation.
