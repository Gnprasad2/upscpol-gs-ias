His village consists of three huts deep in the wilds. Not even birds or stray dogs that usually crowd villages can be seen in these areas. Wearing a small loin cloth and armed with his axe he slowly surveys the </a><span class="s58">penda </span>(forest) where his tribe</p><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">practices a primitive form of agriculture called shifting cultivation. Benda and his friends burn small patches of forest to clear them</p><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for cultivation. The ash is used for making the soil fertile. Benda is happy that the Mahua trees around him are in bloom. How lucky I am to be a part of this beautiful universe, he thinks as he looks up to see the Mahua, Palash and Sal trees that have sheltered him since childhood. Crossing the penda in a gliding motion, Benda makes his way to a stream. As he bends down to scoop up a palmful of water, he remembers to thank Loi-Lugi, the spirit of the forest for allowing him to quench his thirst. Moving on with his friends, Benda chews on succulent leaves and roots. The boys have been trying to collect Gajjhara and Kuchla, from the forest. These are special plants that Benda and his people use. He hopes the spirits of the forest will be kind and lead him to these herbs. These are needed to barter in the madhai or tribal fair coming up the next full moon. He closes his eyes and</p><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tries hard to recall what the elders had taught him about these herbs and the places they are found in. He wishes he had listened more carefully. Suddenly there is a rustling of leaves. Benda and his friends know it is the outsiders who have come searching for them in the wilds. In a single fluid motion Benda and his friends disappear behind the thick canopy of trees and become one with the spirit of the forest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark4715">The story in the box represents the direct relationship of a household belonging to an economically primitive society with nature. Read about other primitive societies which live in complete harmony with their natural environment. You will realise that in all such cases nature is a powerful force, worshipped, revered and conserved. There is direct dependence of</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark4716">human beings on nature for resources which sustain them. The physical environment for such societies becomes the “Mother Nature”.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark4717">The people begin to understand their environment and the forces of nature with the passage of time. With social and cultural development, humans develop better and more efficient technology. They move from a state of necessity to a state of freedom. They create possibilities with the resources obtained from the environment. The human activities create cultural  landscape. The imprints of human activities are created everywhere; health resorts on highlands, huge urban sprawls, fields, orchards and pastures in plains and rolling hills, ports on the coasts, oceanic routes on the oceanic surface and satellites in the space. The earlier scholars termed this as possibilism. Nature provides opportunities and human being make use of these and slowly nature gets humanised and starts bearing the imprints of human endeavour.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part24.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part26.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script></body></html>
