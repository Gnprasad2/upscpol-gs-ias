These forces have played a significant role in giving shape to various surface and subsurface features of the earth. You have already studied about the Plate Tectonics and the movement of the Earth’s plates in the book <i>Fundamentals of Physical Geography </i>(NCERT, 2006). Do you know that the Indian plate was to the south of the equator millions of years ago? Do you also know that it was much larger in size and the Australian plate was a part of it? Over millions of years, this plate broke into many parts and the Australian plate moved towards the southeastern direction and the Indian plate to the north. Can you map different phases in the movement of the Indian plate? This northward movement of the Indian plate is still continuing and it has significant consequences on the physical environment of the Indian subcontinent. Can you name some important consequences of the northward movement of the Indian plate?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: left;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2549">It is primarily through the interplay of these endogenic and exogenic forces and lateral movements of the plates that the present geological structure and geomorphologic processes active in the Indian subcontinent came into existence.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">Based on the variations in its geological structure and formations, India can be divided into three geological divisions.

Apart from these, the Karbi Anglong and the Meghalaya Plateau in the northeast and Rajasthan in the west are also extensions of this block. The northeastern parts are separated by the Maida  fault in West Bengal from the Chotanagpur plateau. In Rajasthan, the desert and other desert-like features overlay this block.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 18pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2557">The Peninsula is formed essentially by a great complex of very ancient gneisses and granites, which constitutes a major part of it. Since the Cambrian period, the Peninsula has been standing like a rigid block with the exception of some  of its western coast which is submerged beneath the sea and some other parts changed due to tectonic activity without affecting the original basement. As a part of the Indo-Australian Plate, it has been subjected to various vertical movements and block faulting. The rift  valleys  of  the  Narmada, the Tapi and the Mahanadi and the Satpura block mountains are some examples of it. The Peninsula mostly consists of relict and residual mountains like the Aravali hills, the Nallamala hills, the Javadi hills, the Veliconda hills, the</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2558">Palkonda range and the Mahendragiri hills, etc. The river valleys here are shallow with low gradients.</a></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 17pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2559">You are aware of the method of calculating the gradient as a part of your study of the book </a><i>Practical Work in Geography- Part I </i>(NCERT, 2006).

Consequently, they are still subjected to the interplay of exogenic and endogenic forces, resulting in the development of faults, folds and thrust plains. These mountains are tectonic in origin, dissected by fast-flowing rivers which are in their youthful stage. Various landforms like gorges, V-shaped valleys, rapids, waterfalls, etc. are indicative of this stage.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_134.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a class="s7" name="bookmark2564">I</a><span class="s7">NDO</span>-G<span class="s7">ANGA</span>-B<span class="s7">RAHMAPUTRA </span>P<span class="s7">LAIN</span><a class="s216" name="bookmark2565">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark2566">The third geological division of India comprises the plains formed by the river Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra.
