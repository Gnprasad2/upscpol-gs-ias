You know that these elements are landforms, soils, climate, water, natural vegetation and diverse flora and fauna. Can you make a list of elements which human beings have created through their activities on the stage provided by the physical environment? Houses, villages, cities, road-rail networks, industries, farms, ports, items of our daily use and all other elements of material culture have been created by human beings using the resources provided by the physical environment. While physical environment has been greatly modified by human beings, it has also, in turn, impacted human lives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark4709">Naturalisation of Humans and Humanisation of Nature</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark4710">Human beings interact with their physical environment with the help of technology. It is not important what human beings produce and create but it is extremely important ‘with the help of what tools and techniques do they produce and create’.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark4711">Technology indicates the level of cultural development of society. Human beings were able to develop technology after they developed better understanding of natural laws. For example, the understanding of concepts of friction and heat helped us discover fire. Similarly, understanding of the secrets of DNA and genetics enabled us to conquer many diseases. We use the laws of aerodynamics to develop faster planes. You can see that knowledge about Nature is extremely important to develop technology and technology loosens the shackles of environment on human beings. In the early stages of their interaction with their natural environment humans were greatly influenced by it. They adapted to the dictates of Nature. This is so because the level of technology was  very  low and the stage of human social development was also primitive. This type of interaction between primitive human society and strong forces of nature was termed as environmental determinism. At that stage of very low technological development we  can  imagine the presence  of a naturalised human,  who  listened to Nature,  was afraid of its fury and worshipped it.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part25.htm">The Naturalisation of Humans</a><a class="toc0" href="part26.htm">Humanisation of Nature</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part23.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part25.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script></body></html>
