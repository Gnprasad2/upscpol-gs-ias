The difference is that growth is quantitative and value neutral. It may have a positive or a negative sign.

This means that development cannot take place unless there is an increment or addition to the existing conditions. Development occurs when positive growth takes place. Yet, positive growth does not always lead to development. Development occurs when there is a positive change in quality.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5083">For example, if the population of a city grows from one lakh to two lakhs over a period of time, we say the city has grown.

The works of two South Asian economists, Mahbub-ul-Haq and Amartya Sen are important in this regard.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5091">The concept of human development was introduced by Dr Mahbub-ul-Haq. Dr Haq has described human development as development that enlarges people’s choices and improves their lives. People are central to all development under this concept. These choices are not fixed but keep on changing. The basic goal of development is to create conditions where people can live meaningful lives.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5092">A meaningful life is not just a long one.

Suitable indicators have been developed to measure each of these aspects. Can you think of some?</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 23pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5102">Very often, people do not have the capability and freedom to make even basic choices. This may be due to their inability to acquire knowledge, their material poverty, social discrimination, inefficiency of institutions and other reasons. This prevents them from leading healthy lives, being able to get educated or to have the means to live a decent life.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5103">Building people’s capabilities in the areas of health, education and access to resources is therefore, important in enlarging their choices. If people do not have capabilities in these areas, their choices also get limited.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5104">For example, an uneducated child cannot make the choice to be a doctor because her choice has got limited by her lack of education. Similarly, very often poor people cannot choose to take medical treatment for disease because their choice is limited by their lack of resources.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " src="Image_260.jpg"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5110">For example, in any country, it is interesting to see which group the most of the school dropouts belong to. This should then lead to an understanding of the reasons for such behaviour. In India, a large number of women and persons belonging to socially and economically backward groups drop out of school. This shows how the choices of these groups get limited by not having access to knowledge.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5111">Sustainability means continuity in the availability of opportunities. To have sustainable human development, each generation must have the same opportunities. All environmental, financial and human resources must be used keeping in mind the future. Misuse of any of these resources will lead to fewer opportunities for future generations.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5112">A good example is about the importance of sending girls to school. If a community does not stress the importance of sending its girl children to school, many opportunities will be lost to these young women when they grow up. Their career choices will be severely curtailed and this would affect other aspects of their lives. So each generation must ensure the availability of choices and opportunities to its future generations.</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5105">Productivity here means  human labour productivity or productivity in terms of human work. Such productivity must be constantly enriched by  building capabilities in people.</a><a class="s216" name="bookmark5113">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><a class="s216" name="bookmark5106">Ultimately, it is people who are the real wealth</a></p><p class="s65" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">Enact a five-minute play with your classmates showing <span class="s87">of nations.
