His teacher told him that the falling rupee is a most likely question either in the ‘Civil Services Mains Examination’ or in interview if he makes to it. Pavitran was wrestling with CAD, FII sell off, RBI’s squeeze on money supply, rising yields on government securities,mountinglosses to banks andother arcane details of themonetaryeconomy. He was struggling to grasp the concepts and understand the links between them which he was told explain the rupee’s downward journey. But his mind kept moving off to a far more enchanting scene. Pavitran is a great fan of the Southern movie queen Sunita. He always watched her movies on a ‘first-day-first-show-basis’. But this time around, he was forced to accord higher priority to stories of rupee’s travails. While he was settling down to his study, his friend Armugam who watched the newly released Sunita starrer <span class="s5">TrichyJunction </span>told him that that her item number in it was simply mind blowing.Pavitran found Sunita’simagineddanceposturesandgyrations floating alongsidetheCAD numbers and the bond yield curves. He wondered whether it would be best to watch the movie or at least the dance number to get the whole distracting business out of his head.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark835">Question</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Assume that you are Pavitran’s elder brother with whom he shares intimate thoughts and concerns. At this time what would be your advice to Pavitran?</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. <span class="p">Knowing that Sunita’s curvaceous figure keeps Pavitran obsessed for days after he has seen the movie, he should altogether avoid thinking about Sunita and not allow Armugam to discuss this film and its details.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. This being one time distraction, Pavitran might well watchthe movie and leave it at that.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. Pavitran should focus on studies as the mains examination is near and it is a very important examination.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4. <span class="s25">Both (1) and (3)</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark836">Discussion</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_553.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is nothing very unique or perverse in Pavitran’s mental state. Many young men (women) develop fascination about heroines (heroes) popular in the celluloid. It is acceptable if there is an artistic appreciation and strong liking of the role played by some actress or actor. But the trouble starts when one falls in morbid love with lights and shadows on the screen. Since Pavitran has such a condition and since the mains examination is not far it is good for him if he can avoid the distraction. He can see the movie after the examination gets over if not in a cinema hall but certainly on TV screen.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">It is also necessary that he learns to discipline himself from the temptations of instantaneous self-gratification. Emotionally mature individuals are able to postpone gratification of desire and concentrate on theimmediatechallenges.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Such distractions sometimes have an infectious quality. One friend starts a discussion about heroines and this or that dance sequence, sexual appeal etc. and everybody joins the rally. It is also good to cut oneself off from such company at least till the time exam is over – without being unpleasant or rude.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Thus answer choice (1) is appropriate.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">One might think that no great a loss would follow if Pavitran just spends three hours for Trichy Junction. The issue is not that. The issue is whether Pavitran is able to set his priority right looking to his tasks at hand. The issue is also whether he has the emotional capability to delay gratification whatever it is worth. Today it is Trichy Junction and Sunita, tomorrow there could be something else. To be a winner in such a difficult examination, he has to cultivate the right temperament or aptitude. From that perspective answer choice (2) is not acceptable.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Answer choice (3) is based on pure rationality. Powerful emotions or urges need moderation by reason. That is the essence of suggestion in (3). It is appropriate.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hence (4) is the right answer choice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part262.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part264.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
