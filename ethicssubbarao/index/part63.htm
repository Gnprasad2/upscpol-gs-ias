Ravidas was born in a cobbler family. In those days, caste system was strong. People were bound by many social restrictions and taboos. Upper castes mainly pursued spiritual knowledge and avocations. The hereditary specialization virtually shut off others, especially the lower social strata from spiritual activities.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">There have been saints who broke through such barriers. Ravidas was foremost among them. According to Dr. Vivek Bhattacharya, Ramananda initiated Ravidas into his religious order. Ramananda was an unorthodox Brahmin. Once he returned after a long pilgrimage. The orthodox Brahmins wanted him to undergo penance or <span class="s5">prayaschitta. </span>Ramananda abandoned the narrow caste concept, and allowed all to enter the temples and also allowed them to become Gurus. Ravidas was among his disciples.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark210">Saintly Ways</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Ravidas was a great devotee of Rama. He would spend his time in meditation and prayer. In the process, he neglectedshoe–making.Hewould be absent minded, unable to concentrate on work and fall behind schedules. His father became exasperated and turned Ravidas out of home. However, Ravidas continued with his old ways.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">He used to supply shoes free to saints and fakirs who happened to pass by his place. He had no interest in material possessions. He feared that they would divert his attention from God<span class="s5">. </span>He used to say, <span class="s5">“What shall I do with any other treasure? I want only my beloved God whom none would be able to steal. The name of god, simply by uttering,generatespowerinmy mind.That blissIcannevergetfromanythingelse”.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Ravidas was initially opposed by Brahmins and other castes because of his low caste status. According to one legend, Brahmins once refused to join a feast in which Ravidas was expected to join.Ravidas didnotattendit.ButtheBrahminssawhim sittingeverywherebetweenthem.Realizing their mistake, they apologized to him and paid him obeisance as to an acknowledged saint.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_153.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">The story may lack historical authenticity. But it yields interesting insights. One is that Ravidas’s saintly qualities triumphed over deep-seated social prejudices. Ramananda was considered a renegade by his fellow caste men. Still, he had the advantages of Brahminical birth and vast learning. In contrast, Ravidas despite his unquestioned piety and godliness had to overcome social barriers to receive his due (though he did not bother about worldly renown) from his coreligionists.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Ravidas is reputed to have miraculous healing powers. He liberally assisted whoever approached him.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">He never accepted offerings of money. One of his devoted followers once presented him with money. On visiting Ravidas, he was surprised to find the money where he had placed it. When he asked Ravidas about it, Ravidas told him to spend the money on building an inn for pilgrims.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark211">Religious Ideas</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To Ravidas, God was all. He thought that men differed from God in having a body. According to <span class="s5">Bhaktamala, </span>Ravidas “<span class="s5">heldthat the soul differs from God in that it is encumberedwith a body. God is everything, gracious to all passions, and should be worshipped with all the devotion that man is capable of. Ravidas selected virtue from vice, made choice of good acts and avoided things forbidden.” </span>Ravidas used to compose songs in praise of God. They became very popular. Thirty have found a place in <span class="s5">Granth Sahib,</span>the sacred religious text of Sikhs. Attracted by his devotion to God and spiritual powers, many people used to visit him. People felt that “his conversation and poetry were like the suns to dispel the darkness of doubt and infidelity.”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">According to <span class="s5">The Cultural History of India:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ravidas was the worshipper of the one infinite God, who is above and beyond all religious sects and without beginning or end. He preached that the lord resides in the hearts of His devotees, and cannot be known through the performance of rites and ceremonies. Only one who has felt the pangs of divine willalone find Him, and the highestexpression of religion in life is the service of men.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Many other saints including Kabir respected him. The fame of Ravidas spread far and wide so much so that even the queen of Chittore touched his feet and had initiation done through him. Ravidas was also responsible for the initiation of Meerabai of Rajasthan, the great royal saint of divine music. Ravidas has a large following known as <span class="s5">Ravidasis </span>who subscribe to theistic form of <span class="s5">Vaishnavism—</span>which is a <span class="s5">Bhakti </span>cult.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Dr. Vivek Bhattacharya considers that the “appearance of Guru Ravidas in the spiritual arena of India in the fifteenth century was a turning point in Indian history”. The acceptance by masses of the son of a cobbler as a spiritual guru represents the final culmination of the <span class="s5">Bhakti movement</span>. His elevation to the highest spiritual gallery of saints signals a great social and religioustransformation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part62.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part64.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
