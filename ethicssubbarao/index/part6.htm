The desires of a person are not bits and pieces randomly thrown together, but form a system which is held together by certain moral ideas. Here, we ignore man’s biological drives based on hunger, thirst and reproductive instincts as also the minimum amenities like shelter and clothing needed for human existence. An individual’s desires reflect the dominant moral features of his character. It is from this point of view that one can understand the significance of a man’s desires.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Human beings desire what they like; and what they like, Ruskin says, reveals what they are. In a way, an individual’s desires shed light on his character and morals. Character consists in the continuous dominance of certain moral features in a man’s conduct. It shows the moral universe which an individual occupies. A man of good character is one who is habitually guided by a sense of duty. A swindler is one who is constantly seeking means of defrauding others. A fanatic is one who is so completely dominated by a single thought that he shuts out completely other important points of view. Similarly, all other kinds of character may be described by reference to the ideas that are dominant in them. Accordingly, many writers define ‘conduct’ as the habitual modes of action that accompany a formed character. In a wider sense, conduct as used in Ethics refers to an individual’s moral life – and not just to an individual’s particular actions.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Ethics regards character as the most important aspect of human life. Occasional good deeds are of no great significance; they have to be performed habitually with few exceptions. Hence Aristotle</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">emphasised that the formation of good habits is essential for cultivating a good character. Will is an expression of character. As expressed in the saying that “the tree is known by its fruit”, good character shows itself in good acts of will. Accordingly, it is said that conduct refers to the habitual modes of action that accompany a formed character.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_005.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Generally, conduct corresponds to character. But it is sometimes said that a man’s conduct depends upon his character and circumstances. By circumstances, we mean in general, a man’s social surroundings such as lineage and upbringing, riches or poverty, health or disease, and so on. As we know, man’s moral effort consists partly in holding on to ethical norms in adverse circumstances.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">The above discussion points to two questions of morality. (1) What are ends to be pursued in life? (2) How can one pursue these ends? Or how can one strengthen his will to pursue the ends or ideals? Or what are the means by which one can cultivate right moral habits?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part5.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part7.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
