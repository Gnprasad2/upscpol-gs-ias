India has also been in the cross hairs of terrorists since long. We need to separate terrorism form force and violence with which it is associated. Force involving elements of compulsion or coercion is socially acceptable as when a judge awards a prison sentence to a criminal. Violence which involves force and physical injury is justified in individual self-defence and or when a nation fights its invaders. But few countenance violence for achieving political and social ends.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the general loathing for terrorism, it occasionally evokes mixed feelings. Defence of terrorism has become fashionable in some quarters. Many citizens are disturbed when they sometimes come across open or thinly disguised defence of terrorism in public discourse and in television channels.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Defence of terrorism in such discussions wears a mantle of high morality, sublime and beyond the reach of smelly masses. Such defences of terrorism appear in the garb of high minded battles for intellectual liberty, academic objectivity, concern for individual freedom and human rights. These defenders claim to uphold the democratic right of dissent and represent the worldviews of the oppressed. These defences obfuscate and cloud the moral issues which terrorism creates. This sows confusion and weakens the will to fight terrorism. It may seem that we are taking a militarist or anti-humanitarian stand and swimming against some streams of popular opinion. But our intention is simply to correct the one-sided view which students may gather from current discussions. This is particularly important since many defenders of terrorism are established academics, commentators and celebrities.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">We will discuss the issues involved in terrorism from the perspective of moral philosophy. We will also trace the roots of what we regard as wrong perspectives on the challenges which terrorism poses.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark799">Definition of Terrorism</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Terrorism is defined in many ways. Its main attributes are the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">A type of violence harming people and damaging property</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">Specific use of violence for achieving social and political ends</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">Creating great fear, alarm and a sense of panic among people</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">Reliance on random or arbitrary use of violence</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">Targeting innocent people or non-combatants</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Another definition of terrorismwhich Caleb Carr gave is: <i>“... thecontemporarynamegiven to, and the modern permutation of, warfare deliberately waged against civilians with the purpose of destroying their will to support either leaders or policies that agents of such violence find objectionable.” </i>It is noteworthy that terrorism is warfare and aims at undermining peoples’ will and belief in their way of living.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_531.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Ordinary people usually condemn terrorism. This attitude is part of common-sense. But what are the possible attitudes of ethical theories towards terrorism? As may be imagined, virtually no ethical theory supports terrorism. This may prove helpful since, as we have seen, ingenious explanations and defences of terrorism are sometimes offered.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark800">Terrorism and Moral Theories</a></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consequentialism</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Consequentialism may possibly condone some terrorist acts if their benefits or welfare effects far exceed the harm they cause. But this is only a theoretical possibility. Terrorism promotes the agenda of small groups at great cost to large populations. It imposes terrible costs on the targeted groups for questionable ends. Terrorist acts create backlash and stiffen opposition to terrorist aims. Terrorist groups often claim to be fighting for justice or for removal of injustice. Very few people subscribe to the justice of terrorist causes. It is, therefore, most unlikely that the net gains from terrorist acts can ever exceed the losses.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Consequentialist theory will also question the efficiency and efficacy of terrorist means. There are other means such as peaceful non-cooperation and civil disobedience for achieving political ends. Democracy allows other means of advancing one’s agenda, and these conform to political morality.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Consequentialist thinkers point out that what counts as doing justice in a given situation is often unclear. For example, in the Arab-Israeli conflict, is it possible to remove grievances of one side without adding to the grievances of the other? If we take into account the above considerations, few real life terrorists will be able to measure up to the requirements imposed by consequentialism.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kantian and natural law approaches</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Two other moral traditions---Kantian and natural law---are directly opposed to random violence which terrorism causes. They impose an indefeasible prohibition on the killing of the innocent. ‘Indefeasible’ here means that killing of innocents is never  permissible in any circumstances whatsoever. Sometimes this prohibition is expressed as the right of innocents not be killed or as our duty not to kill innocents. Thus, these traditions will never permit killing of innocents in malls, restaurants or on railway platforms. This is of course absolutely in line with common-sense.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Terrorists therefore portray the victims as far from innocent. They may claim that the targets belong to national groups which sanctioned injustice and oppression, and are therefore, complicit in evil deeds. The term ‘innocent’ usually designates an individual who is not guilty of moral or legal wrong doing. Terrorist groups tend to attribute remote and farfetched constructive liability to innocent people. For example, Emile Henry, after exploding a bomb in 1894 in a Paris cafe said, “There are no innocents”. This statement is, of course, a fig leaf to cover the crime.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Contractarian view</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_532.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">How will contractarianismreact to terrorism? This traditionconceives justice as a system of principles and dispositions which bind a group of people in so far as they mutually abide by that system. To use a phrase from John Rawls, justice is a sort of “cooperative venture for mutual advantage”. According to this view, justice is not binding under certain conditions, as for example, in the absence of cooperative behaviour and dispositions from others. Thus, terrorists place themselves outside the justice system by violating common (moral) principles and dispositions. In this view of the matter, the terrorist acts are ab initio unjust and indefensible, and deserve to be put down.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Up till now, we considered how different moral approaches are likely to view terrorism. Naturally, these approaches lead to conclusions similar to common sense ideas. Terrorists are misguided, ferocious fanatics who have no regard for human life or common decencies. Still, some writers seek to create a false, revolutionary, romantic halo (a la Che Guevara) around terrorists. Impressionable, idealistic young men and women have to guard themselves against this tendency.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark801">Terrorism in India and State Responses</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">In India, terrorism has diverse origins and aims. Whatever its form, terrorism questions the legitimacy of the state and its instrumentalities. It regards security forces and law and order machinery as oppressors and enemies. Terrorists engage security forces in war-like operations. Naxalites espouse what they consider as economic justice agenda. Terrorism in J&amp;K is externally sponsored. In the north-east, it is linked to local identities. We have characterized these movements in single sentences since our aim is only to outline the moral issues they create.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">In early years after our Independence, government measures to tackle terrorism and secessionist movements enjoyed almost universal support. There were occasional reports about the excesses of army and/or paramilitary forces in North-East. But gradually disquiet arose in some quarters over the means being used for handling terrorists. We need to consider the roots of such disquiet and the groups which articulate it. As we shall see, some people feel that anti-terrorist operations violate liberal, democratic, humanist and legal norms. However, as there is a trade-off between these norms and the requirements of national security, a balance has to be struck between them.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark802">Administrative and Legal Fallout of Encounters</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Operations of security forces against terrorists lead to varied outcomes. A terrorist may be captured during surveillance or investigations. He may be charged for serious offences. Then he becomes entitled to fair trial, due process of law and all the judicial safeguards available to ordinary criminals. The standard of evidence for proving guilt is as high as in ordinary crimes. It is but natural that few witnesses would like to risk their lives by deposing against the accused.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Terrorists are not treated as enemy agents. Although, according to Caleb Carr, terrorism is a form of warfare, terrorists are covered (asymmetrically) under ordinary law like other criminals. US security missions against hard-core terrorists are often based on the principle, ‘Take no prisoners’. The purpose is either to avoid ordinary trials of such terrorists or to avoid the inherent risk in trying to capture terrorists alive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_533.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Often, encounters take place between security personnel and terrorists with casualties on both sides. In these encounters, lives of soldiers are greatly imperilled. They have to observe prescribed rules of engagement while fighting terrorists in encounters. If terrorists die, they cannot be tried. But at times, relatives of deceased terrorists and activists file criminal charges like murder against men conducting operations. Existing laws partly insulate government servants, including security personnel, from culpability for acts done in good faith in line of duty. As such general law protection is inadequate the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) is enforced in disturbed areas. The provisions of this Act are outlined later in the chapter.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Terrorist deaths in encounters create uproar in media and activist community. Encounters are often depicted as brutal suppressions of human rights, security forces as cold blooded killers, and terrorists as innocent, harmless individuals or martyrs fighting for a cause. Soldiers sometimes err and deplorably kill innocents. Army should do its best to avoid such lapses. But critics also need to place themselves in the shoes of soldiers. In the fire and smoke of battle, in the heat of the moment, while staring death in face, and remembering loved ones back home, soldiers may overreact. Only better training and experience in handling such situations can improve their responses.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">But many well-meaning individuals overlook the grave risks which soldiers face. They have a right to self-defence even under strict moral codes. They cannot be expected to fight with hands tied behind their back. They face real time situations whose essence can be summed up as “Kill or be killed”. They are tackling battle hardened terrorists, and not pickpockets or fellows whistling at girls walking on the street. They have to act fast, and cannot calculate carefully ‘the quantum of appropriate force’. In such situations, soldiers are likely to keep firing till guns on the other side become silent.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Nowadays, many activists and academics argue for abolition of AFSPA. But its abolition will expose soldiers to a dual risk: the risks in armed encounters; and prosecutions and imprisonment. Withdrawing protection to soldiers fighting arduous battles will be most unjust. It will prevent them from acting fearlessly. No disciplined soldier will ‘take it easy’, and let terrorist-driven events runtheir course. However, withdrawal of legal cover will definitely undermine his/her morale.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark803">Tender Hearted Reactions to Terrorism</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Why is it that intelligent and reasonable people of good will argue in favour of excessive legal safeguards for terrorists? Why is it that they are willing to expose security forces battling terrorists to legal hazards in addition to battle risks? Diverse ideologies, doctrines and worldviews singly and jointly feed into this approach. These need earnest consideration.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Our views differ to an extent from some current opinions. However, we feel that serving and aspiring civil servants have to adopt a hard-nosed, realistic approach in these matters. They cannot be soft headed or get carried away by stars-in-the-eyes romanticism. This does not involve dumping civil liberties or human values. The issues merit consideration since the stakes involved are very high---the very survival of our nation.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark804">Human Rights</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_534.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">There is a tendency to regard human rights and civil liberties as absolute, unabridgeable and inviolable. This amounts to impracticable moral or legal absolutism. Rights and liberties have to be balanced against equally valued national objectives. Our Constitution permits reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights. Accordingly, courts watered down the right to property. The right to equality is diluted for accommodating policies providing reservations and other benefits to groups considered as victims of past injustice or prejudice. Similar logic would allow reasonable restrictions on civil liberties for fighting terrorism.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark805">Moral Standing of Terrorists</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Opposition of human rights groups to cruel treatment of terrorists is valid though by any moral criteria terrorists stand condemned. They nevertheless have moral status or moral standing. According to Kantianism and natural law ethics, the human rights of terrorists have to be respected. Human rights are rights we possess simply by virtue of our nature or humanity, and we retain them throughout our lives. A killer acts wrongly without thereby losing his moral standing. He should not be tortured or mutilated. This applies to terrorists who are captured and tried in courts. However, if they are awarded death penalty after due legal process, there should be no uproar about it.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark806">Paradox of Freedom/Tolerance</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Liberal advocates of civil liberties overlook another important issue. This point is made by Karl Popper in his book <i>Open Society and its Enemies</i>. He speaks of ‘paradox of tolerance’ and ‘paradox of freedom’. He highlights a dilemma which liberal, humane and democratic societies face. These societies are grounded in principles of tolerance and liberty. But can these be extended to those individuals or groups who oppose such principles? According to Popper, if unfettered liberties are granted to groups who believe neither in liberties or nor in tolerance, it will sound the death knell of free, open democratic societies. Some writers think that Western Europe is already facing such threats to its way of life.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark807">Equity and Reciprocity</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Principles of equity and reciprocity are also relevant to this discussion. As we noted earlier, John Rawls characterized justice as a cooperative venture for mutual benefit. All members of society which adopts a system of justice should abide by its rules. Otherwise, besides being iniquitous, it will break down. If any individuals or groups are disinclined to abide by constitutional arrangement, they cannot still claim its benefits. They automatically forfeit such rights. Giving full benefits of such rights to them is injustice to other law abiding citizens.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark808">Protecting the Nation</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Obviously, no one will deny the need for individual liberties to protect law-abiding citizens against governmental overreach. However, this principle works ideally in a normally functioning democracy in ordinary times. But when the even tenor of ordinary life is disturbed and when armed groups intent on insurrection challenge the state, restrictions on individual liberties become unavoidable. There are many historical examples which show that even established democratic states had to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_535.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">restrict individual liberties during wars and similar emergencies. The first duty of the state is protect a nation’s integrity, and to this end, it has to take all necessary measures. If a state loses to its armed enemies, there will be nothing left---neither constitution, nor order nor citizenry. This is not an alarmist view. Contemporary world has seen the disappearance of many states. And complete anarchy and total civil disorder now prevail in many other nations.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark809">Misapplication of Concepts</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">People often make ‘category errors’ i.e. apply principles applicable in one context to inapplicable situations. They show lack of due proportion in applying general principles to practical life. Ludwig Wittgenstein’s phrase ‘language game’ helps to explain such errors of activists. Wittgenstein uses characteristic situations of life as examples to illustrate certain philosophical ideas. Any language is governed by its rules (or grammar).</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">As it happens, rules are not easily transferable from one sphere of life to another. Often, we fail to recognize this point. For example, a seminar in a university is an academic game. Its rules may have no ready application to family dispute between parents and their kids. Pleading cases in favour of one accused of rape is a legal game. Its rules will hardly be applicable to preaching religious sermons. Similarly, a police encounter with terrorists is a different game whose rules arise in warfare. In these games, the bloodless categories of Ethics or philosophy have limited application. (However, some conventions of fair conduct of war may apply.) The phrase, “It is a different ball game” recognizes such difference between situations of life. This fact is overlooked in the heated debates on terrorism and human rights. Battle ground is not a seminar hall or a court room.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark810">Role of NGOs</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">A characteristic feature of modern world prevents dispassionate and objective discussion on human rights and allied issues. Modern society has a mind boggling number of NGOs and activist groups. Rich donors set up agencies and NGOs for single minded pursuit of specific agendas such as women’s rights, civil liberties, animal rights, and minority rights.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Although such pursuits are unexceptionable in themselves, they generate many attendant problems. One problem is their single-pointed, obsessive, compulsive pursuit of their aims to the exclusion of everything else. These groups are implacable and never satisfied unless their demands are met in toto. In anything and everything, they see violation of their cherished principles. In the process, their advocacy loses moderation and perspective. For example, they will cry hoarse over violation of civil liberties in a country while remaining absolutely silent on its originating cause like violence of disgruntled armed groups often supported by enemy nations. They behave like brief-holding lawyers arguing for only one client. NGOs are sometimes misused by nation states as stalking horses to run their agendas or to muddy political waters in foreign nations to which they are inimical.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Another problem is that these groups are most active in open and democratic nations. Since they have to ply a trade, they select the most hospitable locations. These are of course the diverse democratic nations like India. Unlike in olden days, individuals who manage these bodies are neither philanthropic nor charitable. They are ‘professionals’ with fat salaries. They are always on the lookout for spots where they can produce the maximum ‘bang for the buck’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_536.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Many of these groups have tie ups with UN and other international agencies. Now, we have to show due respect to UN since it is the pillar of the post Second World War global order. But it is also part of the international diplomatic system. It is an international political chess board on which national interests dictate the moves. These are accompanied by postures of moral high mindedness and concern for human values. Without being overly cynical, one has to take such moves and postures with due realism. It is a matter of no small irony that such moral posturing often comes from nations running the most autocratic and despotic regimes. As some of these nations are powerful militarily or economically, smaller nations and even activists and think tanks maintain a studious diplomatic silence. This situation leads to selective targeting of nations using the plank of human rights.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Readers may feel that we have been harsh on the NGOs. We have no intention of running down NGOs. Our comments are directed mostly against ‘activist’ NGOs. There are many others such as Bill Gates and Melissa Foundation and Aga Khan Foundation which render yeoman service to poor and suffering humanity. We hold such bodies in high esteem.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark811">Climate of Current Opinion in Media and Academia</a></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Media</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Finally, the current climate of opinion both in media and social science academia fuels the false narrative on terrorism. Their opinion is anti-establishment, that is, against the existing political set-up. The political wing of media is hostile to governments of the day. (There are exceptions. The US mainstream media was completely in sync with Obama and Hillary and continues to be highly hostile to Trump.) The media is ever ready to pounce on what it regards as the misdeeds of government and its agencies. They are ready to attack government with any available means even those that may harm national interest. We refer to general trends without meaning to paint all with the same brush.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Media houses are involved in cut throat competition for audience and advertising revenues. In order to attract audience attention, they resort to sensationalism and hype. Once again our intention is not to place all media persona in the same bracket. Many of them are learned, enlightened and perceptive. But media enterprises seem to have got trapped in a dynamic which modern technology and the need for gaining commercial traction have created. Given this background, media frequently highlight stories of alleged human rights violations of security personnel and other stories which grab immediate interest in viewers.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark812">Negative Academic Currents</a></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Critical outlook</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Many currents feed into the negativity of academic comment on our national affairs. Academic activity in its very nature aims at questioning prevailing opinions, practices and world views. As Herbert Marcuse remarked, the function of reason is negative and critical. Seeing philosophers as social critics, Karl Marx urged them to submit existing public institutions, and available alternatives, to ‘‘<i>ruthless criticism” ... ‘‘ruthless in two senses: the criticism must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the powers that be”. </i>They have to consider with detachment and impartiality whether political institutions and practices are justified.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_537.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Many writers such as Foucault have argued that institutions of modern society are oppressive, hierarchical, and dehumanizing. Many social theorists argue that deep conflict and dissonance simmer beneath the surface of liberal democracies. But these are effectively masked from us because we are conditioned by falsifying forms of social consciousness. To quote Karl Marx again, critical reflection consists in <i>‘‘enabling the world to clarify its consciousness, in waking it from its dream about itself, in explaining to it the meaning of its own actions.’’ </i>From such perspectives, it is possible to argue that liberal democracies are charades which hide social inequities, and use sophisticated means for pacifying oppressed groups.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Identity groups</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Modern political thinkers often adopt in their writing the point of view of specific identity groups as distinct from that of the larger polity. The groups identify themselves with their race, religion, and gender or minority status. They regard themselves as victims of society and as excluded from its privileges. ‘Multiculturalism’ advocates that dominant groups openly embrace the socially excluded and the marginalized and celebrate social diversities. Many social thinkers sympathise with these groups, and regard them as victims of social injustice. In this vein, scholars expose the ways in which what may appear to be impartial operation of rule of law in fact disguises various unacknowledged political agendas. Similarly, feminists highlight ‘gendered’ practices which aretacit forms patriarchal oppression.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">How do these ideas feed into the current criticism of state operations against terrorist groups? Many terrorist groups are portrayed as victims of oppression and social marginalization. Their alienation is the result of ill treatment they suffer at the hands of the state. Their terrorism, according to some people, is a justified response to the highhanded actions of the state. One may concede that some terrorist groups such as Naxalites and others in North-East have justifiable grievances. Enlightened economic, social and political policies are needed to remove those grievances and set right past wrongs. But some terrorist groups may be absolutely implacable in their attitudes and just refuse compromise and accommodation. In that case, the state may have few options for pursuing peaceful approaches. In any event, no state can unravel itself.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Irrational fear of nationalism</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Occasionally, we come across situations in which students (and some teachers) express anti-national sentiments. Fortunately, student responses are one-off, not deeply thought out actions. But how do we explain such responses from teachers? Their reactions are part of a modern trend which sees nationalism as a danger. Modern thinkers equate genuine nationalism with jingoism, associated among others, with Rudyard Kipling. Fascism is seen as a consequence of unbridled nationalism. Nationalism is also feared since it creates xenophobia or hatred for  foreigners. Many writers mistakenly associate anti-terrorist operations with violent assertion of nationalist feelings, state authority and elite hegemony. But such views are mistaken, and have no support among masses.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Many academics have a self-image of being anti-establishment dissenters. They tend to identify with other dissenters even if they resort to violence and terrorism. Some self-styled intellectuals consider themselves as keepers of a nation’s conscience, and try to hold it to unattainable and impracticable moral standards. Some frustrated people also join with any group which opposes government in any manner.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_538.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">In the preceding paragraphs, we explained why some influential individuals and sections express views out of line with broad national sentiments. In conclusion, we would urge that due consideration should be shown to those who battle for our safety and freedom. We cannot claim unfettered rights of expression to ourselves, or cleanse our consciences by mouthing high moral platitudes. We should not place the moral, psychological and emotional burden of fighting terror only on soldiers. It will be a moral double standard if we preserve all of these privileges and expect our soldiers to follow the motto (in Tennyson’s words):</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Not for us to reason why But to do and die</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark813">Indian Context and AFSA</a></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AFSPA empowers army officers operating in “disturbed” areas with following powers.</p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">After due warning, resort to fire or other force, even if it causes death, against those disturbing law or order, for maintaining public order</span></p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">To destroy arms dumps, hide-outs, fortified positions/shelters/training camps used for launching armed attacks</span></p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">To arrest without a warrant anyone who has committed or suspected to have committed cognizable offences and use needed force for arrest.</span></p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">To enter and search any premise for making arrests, or to rescuing wrongfully restrained persons or for seizing arms, ammunition or explosives</span></p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">Stop and search any vehicle or vessel carrying suspects or weapons</span></p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">Any one arrested should be handed over to the nearest police station at the earliest along with a report on the circumstances of the arrest.</span></p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;"> <span class="s4">Army officers have legal immunity for their actions.
