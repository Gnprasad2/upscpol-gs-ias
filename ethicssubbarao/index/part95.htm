He hails from a cultured family and has a happy married life. His young kid Zafar, aged 7 is exhibiting some behaviour patterns that disturb Mrs. and Mr. Khan. Zafar has been taking pleasure in hurting and torturing creatures for the last two years. It all started when he would pick up some insects such as cockroaches and worms and take delight in cutting them to pieces with a blade. The family keeps some pets including rabbits and some days ago Mr. Khan detected the boy vivisecting a rabbit in a lonely corner of their garden. By the time Mr. Khan intervened it was all over and young Zafar was almost relishing the sight of his bloody hand. Mr. Khan, of course, scolded the kid but they are worried about the gruesome incidents likely to happen from this kind of perverse behaviour.</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark275">Question</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What actions should the parents take? Select from the following options:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. They should ignore the incidents as childish pranks.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">2. They should explain to Zafar the need to behave kindly towards animals and to avoid violence in all forms.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. They should take Zafar to a psychiatrist for counselling and treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. They should notlet Zafar out of sightwhen he is alone.</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark276">Discussion</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The first course of action will be unwise. The type of violent behaviour shown by Zafar is unnatural. It should not be left unattended since the tendency may grow strong and become ingrained.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_221.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The second course of action may not work. Parents can certainly inculcate non-violent thoughts and behaviour in Zafar. But it is a question as to what extent he would absorb such advice. As he is too young, he may not realise that the danger of his behaviour trait.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The third option is the correct response. Normal children do not enjoy torturing and vivisecting insects. If Zafar has been doing this, there may be some underlying pathology. The last incident is definitely serious. More than adults, children generally get attracted to pets and start enjoying their company. Instead, if the boy is killing a pet which is as innocent as a rabbit, there may be a malady. This malady needs to be addressed or else it may spread and the boy may become more violent over time. Finally, he may end up even being a murderer. Early correction could circumvent many ugly situations in adulthood. Outbursts of violent episodes may originate from unpleasant events and a sense of frustration. This diagnosis is important and only after diagnosis a cure can be sought. Khan family would be well advised to consult a child psychologist for treatment of this pathological condition.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The last response will be impracticable. Parents cannot keep continuous watch over children. They may encourage Zafar to play withchildren of his age and promote hisinterest ingroup activities as a means of socialization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part94.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part96.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
