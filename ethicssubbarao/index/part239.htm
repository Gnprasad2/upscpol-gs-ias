Long ago, Aristotle spoke of the virtue of moderation or of the golden mean. But it refers to human temperament than to political creeds. Still, the label ‘moderate’ often appears in political discussions. Moderates may belong to groups who combine elements from two rigid systems or doctrines. Thus,</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">socialism borrows elements from communism and capitalism. It takes democracy and individual freedom from capitalism, and collectiveownership of means of production, publicsector and planning from communism. It is a via media. Moderates are reluctant to introduce major changes. They are not too worked up about the state of society.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">There can be hardliners and soft peddlers within the same party or organization. For example, in the US Democratic Party, Bernie Sanders is to the extreme left of the party. Journalists speak about hawks and doves in foreign policy establishments of USA or Russia. Analysts also speak about hard line and gentle Islamists. At times, such distinctions may exist only in the minds of writers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_480.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Moderates, though not enthusiastic for change, allow for greater innovations than conservatives. They live in an uncomfortable half way house and draw flak from committed party ideologues. They are derided as vacillating and feeble minded. Margaret Thatcher used to refer to her less firebrand supporters as ‘wets’. However, moderates often oppose the harsh and rigid versions of doctrines. They are more humane, and oppose pushing policy measures in violation of human considerations. Their approach can be summed up in the saying, “politics is the art of the possible”.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">We can think of two examples from Stalinist Russia of how moderation could have prevented great harm. If collectivization of agriculture had been implemented less ruthlessly, it would have saved millions of lives. Soviet state would not have suppressed dissent by lining up political opponents before firing squads or by exiling them to forced labour camps in Siberia. Our regrets over such past tragedies are unavailing since history is irreversible, and has no room for might-have-beens. One has to be cautious and wake up in time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part238.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part240.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
