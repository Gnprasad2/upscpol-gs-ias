Why is it important to study? Discuss any one environmental issue from the viewpoint of environmental ethics. </span><span class="s97">(150 words/ 10 marks)</span></p><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="s35">Conventional Ethics deals with moral problems in human contexts. Environmental ethics is a branch of modern applied ethics. It deals with norms, rules, values and criteria which should inform our treatment of nonhuman nature. It covers protection of environment, ecosystems, animal species, unique nature spots, preservation of biodiversity and sustainability.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Its importance lies in extending morality to nature including animal species, which experience pain. More pragmatically, biosphere which supports life on earth has a limited capacity. It needs to be used within its limits without exceeding its capacity for renewal. Otherwise, it will be irretrievably damaged and lose its life sustaining capacity.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A lake or water body is a living ecosystem. It sustains a great variety of plant and aquatic life, and increases biodiversity. Urbanization destroyed many lakes in India. They are heavily polluted; their sources and catchments have been encroached; weeds have destroyed other aquatic life. Lakes as sources of life, biodiversity and aesthetic environment should be preserved.(159 words)</p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) <span class="s94">Differentiate between the following </span><span class="s97">(200 words/ 10 marks)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(i) Law and Ethics</p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii) Ethical management and Management ofethics</p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) Discrimination and Preferential treatment</p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iv) Personal ethics and Professionalethics</p><p class="s101" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: -24pt;    text-align: justify;">(i) <span class="p">Though law and Ethics are related, they differ in many ways. Law is formal and promulgated by sovereign – king or ruler or parliament. It is written and publicised for public information. Obedience to law is compulsory, and its infraction is punishable. Ethics are voluntary. They derive from customs, religion and social norms. Ethics are wider and more stringent than law. </span><span class="s6">(60 words)</span></p><p class="s101" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: -25pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span class="p">Ethical management meansthatthosewho manage acompanyfollowmoralcodesand corporate governance norms.

Professional ethics are the codes which prescribe for professionals like doctors and engineers safe and appropriate methods of working in the interests of clients and society. </span><span class="s6">(37 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: left;">2. Given are two quotations of moral thinkers/philosophers. For each of these, bring out what it means to you in the present context:</p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) <span class="s94">“The weak can never forgive; forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.” </span><span class="s97">(150 words/10 marks)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) <span class="s94">“We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.” </span><span class="s97">(150 words/10 marks)</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -65pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">(a) Forgiveness is to pardon those who harm us or our family or group. It is against normal human tendency of paying others in the same coin. Many religions uphold forgiveness as a virtue. To forgive those who harm us needs moral, psychological and mental strength. We have to overcome feelings of revenge which sway us strongly. This needs moral strength, and overcoming ordinary human tendencies. Besides, we should be able to recognize rationally that in many matters ‘forgive and forget’ helps us in the long term. It ends disputes, clears our minds of clutter and ensures peaceful living. But this constructive resolution needs ability to get past and transcend ingrained negative passions.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus forgiveness presupposes mental and moral strength. However, forgiveness should not become a cover for weakness or inaction. Forgiveness is appropriate when the offences are not too serious. But it will be ruinous for a nation or society to forgive murderers, rapists, saboteurs or traitors. <span class="s6">(155 words)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -35pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) Child’s fear of darkness symbolizes fear of the unknown and unease felt when facing unusual phenomena. In ancient times, people feared natural events like thunder, lightning, floods, eclipses and diseases. They attributed them to evil spirits or to divine anger. However, men gradually saw the patterns of nature, and that it is usually benign. But ignorance and superstitions trouble men in many situationsabout whichthey areignorant or uncertain.Peoplehad many fearsabout how AIDs is transmitted. Many people seek comfort about future by relying on astrology or palmistry.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">If men fear the unknown, they also often turn away from light or truth. This happens when new scientific discoveries undermine strong religious or social beliefs. Thus, Copernicus’s theory of heliocentric solar system met with fierce religious opposition. Biblical fundamentalists still challenge Darwin’s theory of human evolution. Traditionalists oppose enlightened new social trends which threaten their way of life. <span class="s6">(150 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -43pt;    text-align: justify;">3. (a) Mere compliance with law is not enough; the public servant also has to have a well- developed sensibility to ethical issues for effective discharge of duties. Do you agree? Explain with the help of two examples, where</p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) an act is ethically right but not legally and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_747.png"/></span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span class="s94">an act is legally right, but not ethically. </span><span class="s97">(150 words/10 marks)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;    text-align: left;">(b) How do the virtues of trustworthiness and fortitude get manifested in public service?</p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 31pt;text-align: left;">Explain with examples. <span class="s97">(150 words/10 marks)</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -64pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">(a) Just complying with law means playing by the rule book and working mechanically showing no human sympathies or concerns. Following law is important in areas of work strictly bound by regulations or rules. They are usually areas concerned with mutual rights or disposal of public resources open to corruption and favouritism. But many spheres of publicservice are about providing essential goods and services to people and helping the poor and the indigent. In these areas, civil servants cannot perform effectively without warmth of heart and touch of compassion.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(i) After a domestic dispute, H, husband of W, forcibly takes her jewellery and cash and evicts her from home. She approaches the SP. The SP threatens to thrash H and his parents; H is scared and returns the ornaments and cash to</p><p style="padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">W. Though ethically defensible, SP’s action is illegal.</p><p class="s101" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span class="p">A first offender is awarded maximum punishment for simple theft. Though legal, the sentence is unethical because of its severity. </span><span class="s6">(159 words)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -34pt;text-align: justify;">(b) Moral agents should not betray the faith which others repose in them. They should live up to the trust which family, friends and business associates or official colleagues place on them.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Some acts such as cheating and criminal breach of trust are criminal offences. But untrustworthiness can be immoral though not illegal. In administrative situations, officers should be trustworthy. Sometimes, seniors give oral orders to their subordinates. Their execution can at times lead to controversies. On such occasions,seniors have to own up responsibility, andnot let theirsubordinatestake the rap. Otherwise, seniors will be untrustworthy.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fortitude or courage in administrative situations is reflected in courage of conviction. Officers have to show firm resolve, abide by norms, and act only in public welfare. They should not succumb to illegal pressures or inducements. They should not yield to threats and intimidation. Fortitude in these contexts is not valour in battle but steadfastly adhering to official codes and morality. <span class="s6">(158 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -43pt;    text-align: justify;">4. <span class="s94">(a) “Social Values are more important than economic values”. Discuss the above statement with examples in the context of inclusive growth of a nation. </span><span class="s97">(150 words/10 marks)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_748.png"/></span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) SomerecentdevelopmentssuchasintroductionofRTIAct,mediaandjudicial activism, etc., are proving helpful in bringing about greater transparency and accountability in the functioning of the government. However, it is also being observed that at times the mechanisms are misused. Another negative effect is that the offtcers are now afraid to take prompt decisions. Analyse this situation in detail and suggest how this dichotomy can be resolved. Suggest how these negative impacts can be minimized.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 335pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(150 words/10 marks)</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -63pt;text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">(a) Economic values are desirable attributes of an economy. For developing nations, these include steady growth in GDP accompanied by macroeconomic stability and economic diversification. These trends characterize an economy on track to become rich.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Social values highlight people’s educational, cultural and living levels which reflect national progress and welfare. Without social values, growth will not help people. Besides growth, any economy should ensure livelihoods for the poor; provide them with houses, schools and hospitals; and create minimum living standards.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Economists earlier believed that benefits of growth will gradually trickle down to the poor without deliberate state intervention. This did not occur or was taking too long. This led to the view that income and employment opportunities should be created for the poor through suitable programmes. MGREGA was enacted for creating employment; many rural development programmes aim at creating perennial income sources for the poor. Other programmes helping poor include housing, water supply and Jan Dhan Yojana for financial inclusion. <span class="s6">(160words)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: -32pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) Misuse of RTI together with judicial and media activism have created a piquant situation. Civil servants are normally conservative, risk-averse and publicity-shy. Making public their views on commercial and sensitive matters embarrasses them, spoils their relations with affected people, and increases career risks. Press distorts trivial matters. Officers’ service protections are getting pruned. Officers when they make bona fide mistakes are given no benefit of doubt or good faith. These are unintended consequences of well-meaning policies pursued without moderation.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Misuse or disproportionate use of these newinitiativesshould be avoided. Judiciary is invading executive sphere. Officers’ enthusiasm is bridled if other agencies are always breathing down their necks. It increases their risks, and breeds passivity. Judiciary has to restrain itself so that elected representatives and officials can act freely. Recently, Hon. Chief Justice of India (CJI) said that he would override the Speaker on what a money bill is. RTI commissioners and regulators should avoid extremism and refuse to pander to activists. Press Council should act toughly with irresponsible media. <span class="s6">(166 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">5. Two different kinds of attitudes exhibited by public servants towards their work have been identifted as the bureaucratic attitude and the democratic attitude</p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(a) Distinguish between these two terms and write their merits and demerits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_749.png"/></span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <span class="s94">Is it possible to balance the two to create better administration for the faster development of our country? </span><span class="s97">(150 words/10 marks)</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -55pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">(a) Bureaucratic attitudes reflect hierarchical discipline, implicit obedience to orders, top down instructions, and rule bound approaches. Democratic attitude rests on participatory, humanistic and flexible approaches and on bottom-up decision-making.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Merits of bureaucratic systems are: objectivity, rule-boundnature, certainty, and simplicity and Weberian rationality. Its demerits are rigidity, hide bound nature stifling initiative and innovation, and focus on procedures than on results. Democratic approaches can cause confusion, indiscipline, soft-headedness, slow action, and corruption through slackness.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;text-align: justify;">(b) Many argue that the bureaucratic values are unsuited to development needs. Development needs a proactive, dynamic, goal oriented and problem-solving approach. Decision-making has to focus not on procedural formalities but on development objectives. Officers have to work in teams with cohesion and team spirit, breaking hierarchies.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">However, bureaucratic values suck as due procedures, official discipline, financial accountability, and legal orientation are essential organizational requirements. They ensure objectivity and impartiality. Bureaucratic and democratic values in administration are thus not antithetical but complementary. <span class="s6">(156 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">6. Today we ftnd that in spite of various measures like prescribing codes of conduct, setting up vigilance cells/commissions, RTI, active media and strengthening of legal mechanisms, corrupt practices are not coming under control.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <span class="s97">Evaluate the effectiveness of these measures with justifications.</span></p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 39pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <span class="s97">Suggest more effective strategies to tackle this menace. (150 words/ 10 marks)</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -55pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">(a) Measures against corruption are not entirely ineffective. Codes of conduct are partially effective because their breach leads to punishment. For this reason, officers fear getting into bad books of vigilance commissions. RTI mainly aims at transparency and making government information public; reducing corruption is incidental to RTI. Press investigations can unearth malpractices. But they often lack factual and legal validity, and may be silenced. Tightening laws can help; but these get mired in procedures and in courts.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many anti-corruption steps have been taken by government. However, following areas can be strengthened or tried.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">• Speeding up sanctions, approvalsanddelivery of services to citizensandentrepreneurs to minimize scope for bribery</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Reducing economic controls and regulations</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Greater reliance on market forces</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_750.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Minimizing discretionary (as opposed to rule-based) decisions</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Strict rules for handling financialissues</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Striving for attitude change among civil servants, bribe givers and system manipulators.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align:justify; "><a name="bookmark1187">(151 words)</a></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -16pt;    text-align: justify;">7. <span class="s94">At the international level, the bilateral relations between most nations are governed on the policy of promoting one’s own national interest without any regard for the interest of other nations. This leads to conflicts and tensions between the nations. How can ethical consideration help resolve such tensions? Discuss with speciftc examples. </span><span class="s97">(150 words/ 10 marks)</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -31pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">Idealist thinkers advocate ethical dealing among nations, but it proved impracticable. Many writers describe the international political or diplomatic arena as a ‘war system’. As nations relentlessly pursue their own goals, morality takes backseat. Still, some enlightened nations moderate their positions to avoid anarchy and bloodshed.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Nehruji’s Panch Sheel or five principles, which he propounded with the then Chinese Prime Minister, can still inject morality into international affairs. According to these, nations should respect one another’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. They should not break up other nations. Nor should they interfere in their internal affairs either invoking human rights or compulsions of regime change. Nations should pursue equality, mutual benefit, peace and coexistence. These ideas are also embodied in UN Charter. Specific examples of amicable settlement of disputes between nations are hard to come by. Formation of European Union (though now under strain after Brexit) represents an effort at creating harmonious international bodies with built-in dispute resolution mechanisms. <span class="s6">(158 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -16pt;    text-align: justify;">8. <span class="s94">Public servants are likely to confront with the issues of ‘Conflict of Interest’. What do you understand by the term ‘Conflict of Interest’ and how does it manifest in the decision making by public servants? If faced with the ‘Conflict of Interest’ situation, how would you resolve it? Explain with the help of examples. </span><span class="s97">(150 words/10 marks)</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">Public officials have to decide matters on the basis of existing laws, rules, regulations and policies. They have to arrive at decisions objectively without getting influenced by subjective considerations. Subjectivity or one’s personal opinions and preferences should not be allowed to influence one’s decisions.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Further, they should not place themselves in situations which may affect their objectivity and independence. If officials have personal stake for any reason in any matter coming up for their decision, they are said to have a conflict of interest. It means that while duty pulls them in one direction, personal interest pulls them in an opposite direction.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Personal interest can crop up in many ways. An official may have to decide on a dispute over a contract in which his family has an interest. In an interview board in which he is a member, a close relative may appear as a candidate.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He should declare his interest in such matters and recuse himself from them. <span class="s6">(159 words)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_751.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part311.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part313.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
