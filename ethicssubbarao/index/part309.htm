Happiness can mean only sensual enjoyments; hence Mill distinguished between animal satisfactions and happiness resulting from refined cultivation of arts or spirituality. Happiness criterion fails to explain many actions such as the sacrifices which soldiers make in battle; of asceticism of saints; and of mothers jumping into rivers to save their children. Some argue that such self-denial gives these actors happiness. But this sounds artificial. People’s motives and goals differ, and happiness is not their sole aim.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Just trying to go after happiness is futile for it creates satiety and staleness. Happiness is a bye product resulting from intense interest and absorption in certain activities like art, philosophy, science or sports. Happiness is a state of mind. We experience it within a stable family, productive work, literary/artistic interests, and while helping the needy within our means. Paradoxically, egoism hinders happiness. <span class="s6">(160 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -26pt;    text-align: left;">(b) What does ethics seek to promote in human life?

This implies that administrators need an ethical orientation for sympathetically and earnestly helping people at large. Public administration involves constant decision-making. As diverse interests are involved in them, qualities of objectivity, open mindedness, evenhandedness and adherence to norms are crucial. Misconduct, abuse of power and self-aggrandizement have to be shunned.

It goes beyond financial honesty or non-corrupt behaviour. Probity means that public servants will take no undue advantage of any sort from their office. They will avoid any semblance of impropriety.

Virtue is its own reward. They can gently oppose improprieties. They can appeal to the good sentiments of seniors and political leaders. As the difficulties arise from external sources beyond their control, officers cannot overcome them on their own.

A knowledgeable person scores over ignorant opponents. This is obvious in games like chess. In public administration, knowledge covers grasp of rules, regulations and policies applicable to important decisions. These should be used for public good. But knowledgeable but unscrupulous people can twist these for personal gain or for helping cronies. Such officers can cleverly hide their tracks and even involve unsuspecting colleagues in their nefarious actions. In contrast, well- meaning but ill-informed <span style=" color: #1B1B1B;">officers </span>are ineffective.

Human beings occupy a privileged position in creation. Unlike other organisms, they are endowed with reason and capacity for conceptual thought. This attribute entitles them to a high moral standing, and their life and self-chosen aims are treated as inviolable. This also means that existence of human beings is itself the highest end. Therefore, men can never be treated as instruments for achieving any other goal. Any objective however noble, which diminishes human dignity, is unacceptable.</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This principle has often been violated in history. Examples are holocaust, killing of Kulaks during Russian collectivization and atrocities during Cultural Revolution in China. New technologies like cloning and stem cell research may tempt scientists and politicians to conduct experiments which violate the sanctity of human life and dignity. Similar dangers lurk in robotics and artificial intelligence; these advances need regulation in human interest. <span class="s106">(154 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -43pt;    text-align: justify;">4. <span class="s94">(a) Which eminent personality has inspired you the most in the context of ethical conduct in life?

He recognizedthe weaknesses-</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">--like idol worship, priestly class and excessive ritualism--which crept into Hinduism, and sought to remedy them. He lost faith in idol worship when he witnessed a rat running over Shiva idol and nibbling at offerings devotees gave. Thus, he changed his traditional views based on factual observations. His openness is remarkable considering his rural roots and conservative education.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">He was not just negative, but revived authentic, ancient Hindu practices. He opposed caste system and desired merit-based upward social mobility. He advocated that women should have full equality, as in ancient India, with men. This is a forward-looking idea presaging modern concepts of gender equity. His insistence that priests should be learned and pure hearted applies to all religions. Dayanand Saraswati created organizations for social work.

This situation damages individual and social welfare. Trust is essential for harmonious working of society. Economic transactions and social interactions suffer if individuals and economic agents distrust one another. Breach of trust is a vice and keeping promises is a virtue. If students do not trust teachers, if citizens do not trust police, if litigants have no faith in judiciary, and if constituents distrust elected representatives, economic progress will suffer.</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Peopleandinstitutions have to work hard to re-establish an atmosphere of trust.Politicians should act morally, refurbish their image, and work for people’s welfare. Public servants should observe norms and reduce corruption. They should provide services diligently and promptly to citizens. Business men should adhere to sound and ethical business practices.

However, there is no dearth of instances where affluent and powerful people indulge in corruption in a big way. Whatare the basic causes of corruption among people? Support your answer with examples. <span class="s97">(10 marks, 150 words)</span></p><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="s35">Low pay and facilities can lead to corruption since employees unable to meet expensesor access essential services resort to corruption. Permanent government servants are now well paid though contract employees still get poor pay. As corruption is practised by the well-off too, poverty alone does not explain corruption.</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Corruption arises from one’s unethical nature. Virtuous people refuse to be corrupt despite being poor. Many poor auto rickshaw drivers return valuables which passengers forgetfully leave behind. Rich doctors and lawyers take cash payments to avoid taxes. Excessive regulations breed corruption; officers are bribed by businesses to violate rules and speed up work. Corruption is also political. Parties fund their elections by striking backdoor deals with industrialists. Permissive morals, cynicism and lack of accountability promote corruption. Many recent scams would have gone unchecked but for CAG audit and judicial activism.

These include: hisfamilyand social background; hiseconomicstatus; hiseducation;age,occupation,and</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">membership in an urban or rural community; his ideological views; his knowledge; and his <span style=" color: #1B1B1B;">personality </span>traits.

These contrasting views depend on the interplay of factors impinging on one’s attitude to caste system. Members from traditional, conservative, orthodox and rural households may support caste system. They are part of its hierarchy; their relatives and friends are from the same caste; they tend to marry within caste. They have no exposure to modern social or economic trends or occupations. In contrast, those with urban, educated background and working in far off states in modern sectors and meeting diverse groups will have weaker caste affiliations. Caste barriers are weakening, though caste <span style=" color: #1B1B1B;">based </span>political mobilization is gaining strength. <span class="s103">(151 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">7. <span class="s94">What does ‘accountability’ mean in the context of public service?

Ministers are individually answerable to prime minister, and the cabinet to parliament. Public servants are also answerable in another sense. They not only have to perform assignedtasks but also have to followlawsand rules in discharging </span><span class="s104">their functions. Accountability implies that public servants should also follow ethical norms whether included in codes of conduct or in ordinary morals.</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Accountability is enforced through external and internal controls. Controls on public servants from outside bureaucracy include legislative supervision of administrative action; judicial scrutiny of government policies and orders; and popular participation in government. The internal controls include: rules and procedures; ethical and work standards; disciplinary measures for punishing erring officials; democratizing administration; and provisions for freedom of information and whistle blowers. Ideally, accountability should become part of the mindset of officials and should be spontaneous. <span class="s106">(154 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">8. <span class="s94">We are witnessing increasing instances of sexual violence against women in the country.

Programmes highlighting women’s role as mothers and guardians of children will help reduce domestic violence. It is often dowry related. Dramas and visual clips should be used to highlight the inequity of dowry demands and to refine sentiments of husbands and in-laws.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">Women police and plain clothes men should be deployed on buses and local trains both during peak and off traffic hours. Known rowdies should be periodically rounded up. Young women should be given training in self-defence. Their psychological strength should be boosted so that they can act bravely. Young girls should move in groups and</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">help one another in meeting violence.

Now-a-days, there is an increasing thrust on economic development all around the globe. At the same time, there is also an increasing concern about environmental degradation caused by development. Many a time, we face a direct conflict between developmental activity and environmental quality. It is neither feasible to stop or curtail the development process, nor it is advisable to keep degrading the environment, as it threatens our very survival.</p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Discuss some feasible strategies which could be adopted to eliminate this conflict and which could lead to sustainable development.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-left: 335pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(250 words, 20 marks)</p><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -31pt;text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="s35">Although conflicts arise often between economic development and environmental preservation, they can be largely reconciled. We should not adopt an either/or approach, favouring exclusively environment or development. Sustainable development aims at balancing the two.</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">Environmental concerns should be built into policies. While trying to develop natural resources, build projects and generate power, their impacts on environment have to be minimized. Our climate change policy seeks to tackle many adverse effects of global warming. <span style=" color: #231F20;">Simultaneously, it promotes sustainability in ecologically fragile areas</span><span style=" color: #F00;">.</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">Low carbon growth strategy, especially in energy and related sectors, reduces environmental damage. By reducing the energy intensity of GDP growth, by promoting energy efficiency and non-conventional energy sources, the consumption of depleting resources and emissions of GH gases can be reduced. Similarly, clean technologies both promote growth and cause less pollution.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">By conserving ecologically fragile areas such as Himalayas and Western Ghats, we can preserve environment, speed up growth and protect the livelihoods of the poor. Conservation strategies have <span style=" color: #231F20;">to cover </span>lakes, water bodies, rivers, mangroves and coastal areas. It is essential to conserve the biodiversity of the nation. Unless the extensive and rich gene pool of crops and biota is safeguarded, our food security will be endangered. Such biodiversity is best conserved in biospheres and other protected areas.</p><p class="s100" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To minimize the adverse effect of projects, they are <span style=" color: #231F20;">environmentally assessed, and suitable safeguards are built-in. Projects can be located in areas where they will have least harmful effects.</span></p><p class="s100" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Children have to imbibe lessons about the need to conserve environment.
