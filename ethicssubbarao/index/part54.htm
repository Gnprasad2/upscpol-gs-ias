This topic is mentioned under the rubric or heading of ‘human values’. Values can be seen in two ways: as ideals and as desirable individual moral qualities. We first look at the list of human values which Marshall Urban Wilbur gives. He lists human values as they relate to individual human beings. He classifies values as bodily values, economic values, values of recreation, values of association, character values, aesthetic values, intellectual values and religious values. This classification refers to values encompassing almost all human activities. The activities can be defined as bodily, social and those transcending these two.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_127.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The bodily, economic and recreation values involve the satisfaction of wants connected with man’s bodily self. They are organic Values of character and values of association are connected with man’s social self. They arise only in relations of the self to others. The aesthetic, intellectual and religious values while related to the bodily and social self and conditioned by them, arise only in functioning of the self that goes beyond them. These three categories are spiritual in two senses. They are spiritual in being hyper-organic. In addition, ‘spiritual values’ also mean objects of human interest which are of an ideal nature like truth, goodness and beauty. We call them things of the spirit.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The intellectual values of knowledge are highly prized. Knowledge has a highly instrumental value and is an indispensablemeans for acquisition of bodilyandeconomicgood.It helps in imbibing cultural, aestheticand social values.Humanbeings have an urge to realise theirinnate potentials as part of self realisation. Education is needed for this purpose. Religious values concern divine things, but some people have little inclination for them.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The above values pertain to individual men and women. What people consider as human values can vary. Values are codes of internal conduct, the principles according to which men lead their lives and make decisions. We get the values first from our parents. To these are added the values from peers, teachers and religion. Human Values are also defined as those universal concepts found in all cultures and societies at all times and places. Five such human values are - truth, right conduct, love, peace and non-violence.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Humanvaluescanhave anothermeaning as recognizing humanrights.Humanism as a doctrine placed man at the centre of discussion in philosophy, morals and humanities. It focuses on human happiness, human concerns and human freedom and achievement. It is what underlies the saying that ‘man is the measure of all things’. We can also say that ‘man is the be-all and end-all of things’. In one form, Kant’s categorical imperative implies this idea. Human beings have to be always treated as ends in themselves and not as means to any putative higher end.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Humanism is often seen in opposition to religion. Religious doctrines contain various perspectives on God and divine purposes. They claim that the universe is moving inexorably towards divinely ordained purposes. In this process, man though important, has to follow divine will and divine prescriptions as revealed to holy men or prophets. Humanism rejects religious ideas, affirms autonomy of humanreason and man’sduty to chalk out independentlythe paths of selfdevelopment and social progress. This approach will result in a different set of values, though generally not too different from those which religions uphold.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">So far, we considered the meanings of human values. We have to examine the lives and doctrines of great leaders, reformers and administrators from this viewpoint. Religious discourse may often focus on spiritual exercises, theological or doctrinal questions and on external religious observances. Sometimes, religious leaders promote narrow outlook of bigotry and sectarian intolerance. We have to steer clear of such views. Religious approaches have to promote feelings of common humanity, human fraternity, social equality and mutual tolerance. Students, in their reading of famous historical personalities, should concentrate on this aspect.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Our selection of historical personalities has to be necessarily restricted. We have mainly included religious and social reformers. We tried to include the more well–known figures. But it does not mean that we regard the others as unimportant. India is a land of great saints and spiritual</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">leaders. Only erudite and devoted scholars can do justice to the subject. Our limited purpose is to outline the inspiring lives and teachings of a few great spiritual thinkers. Students can follow this approach whilereading about otherleaders and administrators.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_128.png"/></span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part53.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part55.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
