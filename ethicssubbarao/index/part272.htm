This evening the Board of the corporation decided that she is to be appointed as the Chief Executive and President of the Board of the corporation for a term of three years. Obviously, she was overjoyed with the recognition and honour bestowed upon her – though she had migrated to USA only 18 years ago. After exchanging pleasantries with all the senior colleagues who had come to greet her in her chamber, she was late reaching home. When she just parked the car in her garage, on the spacious balcony, she saw her well-educated mom Malathi waiting for her. Seeing her, Rohini spoke in a cheerful tone “Mom, today I have great news to share with you.” Malathi’s response was instantaneous, “Rohini, there is no milk in the house. At least for tomorrow, why don’t you go and pick up some packets rightaway?”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Rohini was a bit surprised because her husband Ashwath should have reached home much earlier. When she asked what prevented Ashwath from doing this as she was already late, Malathi coldly told that Ashwath is tired this evening and resting.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Rohini was already at a high position in corporate ladder in USA and they were staying in an exclusive area. So she had to go to the nearby town to pick up milk and she took another 45 minutes to come home. Once in home she shared the good news with Malathi. Malathi however, in a sober tone told her that a woman has to look after husband, children and parents and that that is inevitable. So, Rohiniwould do well to leave her ‘crown’ in office and remain the good daughter she is.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark875">Question</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Review each of the following statements from the standpoint of emotional intelligence and state with reasons whether you agree with the statement or not. There may be more than one valid statement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_570.png"/></span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">1. <span class="p">Rohini did not expect this treatment from her mom. Before asking her to get milk right way Malathi should have at least shown curiosity about the good news that Rohini hinted at.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Malathi is right. An individual owes his/ her first duty to family members.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">3. Malathi has shown poor emotional competence. Even after knowing the good news instead of complimenting Rohini, she preferred to give a lecture like a wise person.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">4. With too little expression of positive emotions and obsessive focus on performance and duty, Indian parenting acquires a robotic quality. Malathi is a victim of that type of culture.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark876">Discussion</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The statement (1) is definitely valid. Rohini was late from office, and she had mentioned that she had good news to share. Any sensible family member at that time would want to know what the good news is. That is applied emotional intelligence – plain and simple. Procuring milk is not such a big issue. It would have been understandable if somebody had fallen seriously ill and shifting him/her to hospital was required. Then that activity would have overriding preference and sharing of good news could wait. That was not the situation.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">The secondstatement hasgotthe firstpart wrong.Yes,thereis aprimarydutyto familymembers, but that duty must be a sensible call. Trivia like buying milk cannot be elevated to the level of duty to keep in abeyance the joy of life and make it mechanical.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The third statement is correct. After hearing the news the educated lady that Malathi is, she should have appreciated the implication. It is no ordinary achievement for a woman executive to break the glass ceilings in American society. The achievement is especially remarkable because the executive is an immigrant and carries an unspoken burden of being non-native. Once that appreciation is in place she should have felt proud that her daughter has accomplished this feat and should have profusely congratulated her. There was no need to talk about duties – much less about the office ‘crown’. That sarcasm was completely out of place.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">There is substance in the fourth statement. Emphasis on performance and duty is fine. At the same time positive emotions – support, friendliness, empathy and sharing of joy in achievement – are equally important. The scale should be balanced in the middle and be not tilted on either side. Indian parenting may indeed have a bias and this bias might have found expression in the behaviour of Malathi.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s20" style=" background-color: #E6E7E8;">   Summary </span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ The expression ‘emotional intelligence’ may seem a contradiction in terms.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">¤ Philosophers saw a sharp dichotomy between the two sides – emotional and intellectual–of human mental life.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">¤ The skill sets which public servants require fall into three distinct, though not watertight, categories.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">¤ These are intellectual abilities (comprising mathematical and verbal skills), moral qualities and emotional intelligence.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">¤ The term IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a score on a test that measures an individual’s cognitive ability in comparison to the general population.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_571.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ IQ tests are designed to measure general ability to solve problems and understand concepts.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ These in turn include - reasoning ability, problem-solving ability, and ability to perceive relationships between things and ability to store and retrieve information.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ For over hundred years, intelligence meant only the scores of intelligence tests.

Its emergence marks a major shift in thinking. It arose from radical changes in the operating environment of businesses.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ The twin forces of globalization and information technology radically transformed the operating environment of businesses.

Nowadays, the teams are made up of knowledge workers with specialized skills.
