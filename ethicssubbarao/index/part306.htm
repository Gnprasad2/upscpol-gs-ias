What do you understand by ‘values’ and ‘ethics’? In what way is it important to be ethical along with being professionally competent?</p><p class="s95" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 324pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(10 marks | 150 words)</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">Values are what we consider good, desirable or worthwhile. They refer to rightness, duty, virtues, beauty, truth and holiness. Values are conceptions which enable us to select right ends and means. They represent the ideals we cherish.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">Ethics or morals are the commonly accepted behaviour codes we follow. They are standards we use to distinguish right actions from wrong actions and good thoughts, motives, and aims from bad ones. Values and ethics overlap.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Professionals need skills for efficiently doing their jobs. But mere technical competence is insufficient. Every profession---public service, medicine, accountancy or software programming---has its ethical codes which its practitioners have to observe. Such codes ensure provision of professional services at the required standards with due care and diligence. In addition, professionals have to observe common morality. For example, doctors or lawyers should not fleece customers nor take advantage of their often desperate situation. Professionals have to be sympathetic and humane so that people are genuinely satisfied. <span class="s6">(160 words)</span></p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: -43pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s96">2. </span><span class="s94">(a) What do you understand by the following terms in the context of public service? </span>(5 terms <span class="s98">× </span>3 marks each=15 marks |250 words)</p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) <span class="s94">Integrity</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) <span class="s94">Perseverance</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c) <span class="s94">Spirit of service</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(d) <span class="s94">Commitment</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(e) <span class="s94">Courage of conviction</span></p><p class="s99" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. Integrity <span class="s100">in public service first connotes honesty and eschewing corruption in all its forms. It also means intellectual honesty or giving correct advice to bosses without pandering to their views or wishes. It involves faithfully following national norms and dutifully implementing government policies even if one disagrees with them.</span></p><p class="s99" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Perseverance <span class="s100">means steadfast pursuit of one’s chosen goals without getting discouraged by setbacks. Essentially, one should not be deterred by temporary reverses. Government’s initiatives in economic, social and infrastructure spheres and for economic reforms face many hurdles. Still policy-makers and executives should not be disheartened but resolutely pursue such programmes.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Spirit of service <span class="p">refers to the desirable motivation which spurs our work in public organizations.One canthink of work as a means of earning a living, with attendant prestige, and opportunity to make a buck on the side. But work is an opportunity to help needy fellow citizens and contribute to social welfare.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_723.png"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Commitment <span class="p">means that one is intensely and passionately wedded to one’s work. Many people work on their jobs mechanically, lackadaisically, and as an unavoidable chore. Commitment is the mark of those like accomplished musicians or scientists or sportsmen for whom work is an end in itself and holds their interest all the time.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Courage of conviction <span class="p">means willingness to stick to one’s principles even if they are unpopular and face vehement opposition. Often, we hide our genuine feelings and views for sake of social conformity or for avoiding unpleasantness. But moral courage demands that we boldly espouse our favourite causes and express our genuine feelings.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align:justify; "><a name="bookmark1176">(258 words)</a></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: -25pt;    text-align:justify; ">(b) Indicate two more** attributes which you consider important for public service. Justify your answer. <span class="s97">(10 marks |100 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 56pt;text-align: left;">[(**other than those ftve earlier mentioned- integrity, perseverance etc.)</p><p class="s99" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -30pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="s100">Objectivity and compassion are two other attributes civil servants need. Many matters which public servants decide involve competing claims of litigants or helping people under government programmes. Objectivity ensures that in acting on such questions civil servants act without favouring or harming any individual or group out of prejudice or subjectivity.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Compassion is another attribute of good civil servants. In our country, many individuals and groups are still poor. Further, many suffer from ill effects of past social and economic practices. They cannot effectively articulate their needs and problems. Empathy and compassions will enable public servants to get into the shoes of the poor and vulnerable and help them proactively. <span class="s6">(110 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align:justify; ">3. <span class="s94">What is ’emotional intelligence’ and how can it be developed in people? How does it help an individual in taking ethical decisions? </span><span class="s97">(10 marks | 150 words)</span></p><p class="s99" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -31pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="s100">Emotional intelligence differs from logical and analytical abilities which underlie our thinking. It refers to constructive management of our emotions and passions. Its attributes are ability to postpone immediate pleasures, to persist with a task despite difficulties, to control one’s moods, to prevent despair from destroying our thinking, to sympathize with others and to be hopeful. It also enables us to understand the motives and feelings of others.</span></p><p class="s100" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Emotional intelligence has to be cultivated like other virtues. By nature, human beings are inward-looking and ignore the thoughts, feelings, motives and reactions of others. They need to silence their egos and take real interest in and pay heed to others. Constant practice can <span style=" color: #231F20;">help </span>in improving emotional intelligence.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Because of emotional intelligence, people empathize with others. Concern for others and benevolence it promotes are the basis for morality. It makes people less selfish and self- preoccupied; they will look to the problems of others and help them. <span class="s6">(156 words)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_724.png"/></span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">4. Some people feel that values keep changing with time and situation, while others strongly believe that there are certain universal and eternal human values. Give your perception in this regard with due justiftcation.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-left: 324pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: justify;">(10 marks | 150 words)</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -31pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">The views mentioned in the question are known as moral subjectivism or relativism and moral objectivism or universalism. Moral subjectivists argue that ethical norms are not universal and are relative to a society or culture. Some argue that morality can vary as between individuals.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Cultural relativism or differences in social norms are highlighted by anthropologists. However, the social norms they mention are outward forms of behaviour, fashions, ceremonies, etiquettes and religious practices. Many of these result from accidents of geography and history. Further, morality being social, no Individual can have his own morals.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">Universal moral values are deeply rooted in human nature. They are core morals such as prohibition of murder, rape, violence and of lesser anti-social tendencies. On the positive side, they include the cardinal virtues such as justice, prudence, fortitude, and temperance. These subsume all the other virtues like compassion, generosity and altruism, which are applicable in all human societies at all times. <span class="s6">(155 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -19pt;text-align: justify;">5. <span class="s94">What do you understand by the term ‘voice of conscience’? How do you prepare yourself to heed to the voice of conscience? </span><span class="s97">(10 marks| 150 words)</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -29pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">Conscience represents our moral being. It consists of the ethical principles which we have learnt and internalized. We imbibe these principles during our upbringing, study, and exposure to religious ideas. Conscience stands like a sentinel watching our actions and conduct. There are times when our actions, decisions and conduct fail to measure up to our acquired moral values embedded in our conscience. Conscience makes us conscious of such failures and causes mental disquiet. This is popularly known as ‘voice of conscience’.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Heeding the voice of conscience is another expression for following the path of morality. To this end, we should be conscious of moral codes, and follow them when appropriate situations arise. In ordinary situations of life in family, at office and among friends, moral issues seldom arise. But we should be on lookout and recognize the moral dimensions of situations. Following conscience, like forming good character, depends on practice and should be made into a habit.

Narrate one incident in your life when you were faced with such a crisis and how you resolved the same.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align:justify; ">(10 marks| 150 words)</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -31pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">Crisis of conscience refers to a situation that severely tests one’s moral calibre. One may end up violating moral values in such situations. They are hard to tackle. People are torn apart by conflict between conscience and self-interest.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_725.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">While in university, I met and fell in love with Bhagyalakshmi, a backward caste medical student. We decided to tell our parents only after getting jobs. Then, my father contracted a dangerous disease and had to take voluntary retirement. We had to live on meager income from his savings. A relative promised that if I marry his daughter he would clear father’s home loan. My parents were keen on the match. This put me in a quandary and mental turmoil. Then I discussed the problem with Bhagyalakshmi. We told parents of our love, and assured them that we would look after them. We promised to make loan repayments from our joint incomes after we get jobs. My parents agreed. <span class="s6">(158 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">7. <span class="s94">Given below are three quotations of great moral thinkers/philosophers. For each of these quotations, bring out what it means to you in the present context: </span><span class="s97">(each quote for 10 marks and 150 words=total 30 marks)</span></p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) “There is enough on this earth for every one’s need but not for no one’s greed.” Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;text-align: justify;">(b) “Nearly all mencan withstand adversity, but if you want to test aman’s character, give him power.”—Abraham Lincoln</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;text-align: justify;">(c) “I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who overcomes his enemies.”—Aristotle</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -51pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. (a) From economic angle, this refers to Gandhiji’s idealist view of the rich as holders of wealth only as trust and as under a moral duty to share it with the poor. Then, earth’s produce will suffice for all. From environmentalist view, it points to need for sustainable development.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) Unbridled political power breeds arbitrariness, oppression and corruption. Rulers get addicted to power, and give up ethical values. Power psychologically changes rulers for the worse. It goes quickly to head undermining one’s rational thinking and moral sense. Many perceptive thinkers highlighted this aspect of power. People can endure great trouble, but are quickly intoxicated by power.</p><p class="s101" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(c) <span class="p">According to sages and philosophers, human victories cover two areas. Men fight wars and defeat their enemies. Common sense considers these as victories, and celebrates war victories. Such victories need skill and courage. But men also have to tame their unruly passions and evil tendencies. This is harder since they involve changing our innate nature. </span><span class="s6">(160 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">8. <span class="s94">“The good of an individual is contained in the good of all.” What do you understand by this statement?

He belongs to a social collective, shares its norms and is situated within it. His whole existence in the present diversified economy depends on society. Modern amenities and comforts will be unthinkable in its absence. To some extent, one can pursue his goals and happiness independent of society. But one cannot be at the same time only self-seeking. A society of selfish individuals will become weak. Any society has to care for its poor and the weak; or they will be a drag on society.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Following measures will advance this principle in public life:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Encouraging and honouring philanthropists and altruistic individuals and bodies</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Following policies for inclusive economic and social growth</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Inculcating concern in government servants for poor and the weak</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Empowering women, children and socially disadvantaged groups</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Providing adequate budgetary outlay for programmes for the poor</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Bringing tribals into national main stream <span class="s13">(157 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: left;">9. It is often said that ‘politics’ and ‘ethics’ do not go together. What is your opinion in this regard? Justify your answer with illustrations.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 333pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(10 marks| 150 words)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. Politics whether in democratic or authoritarian societies involves acquiring and retaining power which often requires unethical means. Where the game of grabbing power is intense, and players are unsure whether rivals will ‘play by rules’, they will adopt unfair means. As authority is a coveted goal, people will abandon morality for its sake.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">In democratic societies, especially during elections, candidates are only too ready to break rules. They appeal to narrow sentiments which rest on caste prejudice, religious fanaticism and regional identities. They will make wild promises and adopt policies which damage economic well-being and social harmony. To meet election expenses and for making money, they tie up with vested interests. If they get into power, they will support the vested interests at the cost of the common man.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">The experience of authoritarian regimes is much worse. As examples, we can cite Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia or the Pol Pot regime. Democracy and constitutional safeguards alone can check unbridled power. <span class="s6">(160 words)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part305.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part307.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
