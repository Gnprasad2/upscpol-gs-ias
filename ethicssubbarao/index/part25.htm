There are some actions which have both good and bad consequences. These are known as acts with double effects.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The problem is that it is difficult to decide whether such actions are good or bad.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For resolving such questions, moralists have proposed the following general principles.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ The action which produces the double effects must be either good or indifferent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_029.png"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ If it is inherently bad, it can never become good, and will continue to be bad.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ The good effect must be direct i.e. it should not happen via a bad effect.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ The intention or purpose of the act must be good.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ There must be a reason or cause upfront for performing the action.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ The good effect must be proportionately much more than the bad effect.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">In acts with double effects, the main problem is to decide whether the good effect is the outcome of the bad effect. In that case, the act becomes bad. If the good effect persists when the evil effect is removed, then the good effect is not caused by the evil effect. In case of doubt, one needs to make certain that the good effect is not subordinated to the bad one. The point to note is that for a double effect to be good, the good effect should not be caused by the evil effect.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">A few examples will help in explaining the principle of double effect. St. Thomas Aquinas first formulated the principle, and illustrated it with an example of self defence. X is attacked by Y. While protecting himself, X kills Y. The good effect is that X saved himself. The bad effect is that Y got killed. Aquinas regarded the act as good since X did not intend to kill Y. It happened as an unintended consequence or by-product of his self defensive action. Aquinas, however, made it clear that the force used in self defence should not be excessive, but just sufficient to serve the purpose of saving X. The currently popular term ‘collateral damage’ refers to actions with double effects. It takes comic form in movie car chases in which villains pursue the hero and the heroine, but in the process, drive helter skelter the people sitting in wayside cafes.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our next example is from the Stanford encyclopaedia of philosophy.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">The terror bomber aims to bring about civilian deaths in order to weakenthe resolve of the enemy: when his bombs kill civilians this is a consequence that he intends. The tactical bomber aims at military targets while foreseeing that bombingsuchtargetswill cause civiliandeaths. Whenhisbombskill civiliansthis is a foreseenbut unintended consequence of his actions. Even if it isequally certain that the two bomberswill cause the same number of civilian deaths, terror bombing is impermissible.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">As we mentioned earlier, actions with double effects should produce many more beneficial than harmful effects. This is the standard traditional philosophical view.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark39">Criticisms of the Doctrine of Double Effect</a></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Moral agents are responsible for all the anticipated consequences of their actions.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ If moral agents can foresee the two effects of their actions, they have to take moral responsibility for both effects. They cannot evade responsibility by deciding to intend only the effect that suits them or the good effects.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ Some people (those who believe in moral objectivism) argue that intentions of individuals are irrelevant, and that morality cannot decide the rightness or wrongness of an act by looking at the intention of the person who carries it out. In their view, some acts are objectively right or wrong, and the intention of the person who carries out those acts is irrelevant.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ However, most legal systems regard the intention of a person (or <span class="s5">mens rea </span>in legal terminology) is a vital element in deciding his culpability and the gravity of the crime, particularly in cases of causing death.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_030.png"/></span></p>  <p  style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 146pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Case Study </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Michael is a surgeon in the United States. On the issue of abortion, social opinion is sharply divided in the USA. There is one group of conservative, religious and pro life activists, who regard human life from its inception as sacrosanct. They totally oppose abortion in principle. They also belong to the right wing of the political spectrum.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">The other group consists of liberals of various hues including women’s rights activists. They are known as pro choice, and advocate that a pregnant woman should have full freedom to undergo abortion. For them, the decision of a woman to continue or terminate her pregnancy is her individual choice and not a matter of social or religious policy.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">As a prolife protagonist, Michael believed that abortion was wrong, even in order to save the mother’s life. So, he refuses to perform an abortion for Martha who fears that her pregnancy might endanger her health in some ways. Since Martha had faith in Michael’s skills, she decides reluctantly to go to another clinic.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">After a couple of years Martha is pregnant again and this time she is diagnosed with cancer, and goes to Michael for an operation. He agrees to perform a hysterectomy on Martha although the foetus might die in the process.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark40">Question</a></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Do you think that Michael’s decisions show his moral inconsistency?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark41">Discussion</a></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">In this case, we can apply the doctrine of double effect. It makes a subtle distinction between a result which a moral agent intends, and a result which follows as a side effect of what he does. In the first situation, the result (death of foetus) is a direct consequence of his action; he intends it. In the second situation, though he may foresee the result, he does not intend it.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">This principle explains why Michael later agreed to perform the operation. Had he performed abortion, he would have intended the death of the unborn baby. This would be against his moral principle of valuing life. But in carrying out the hysterectomy to treat Martha’s cancer, Michael would aim to save Martha’s life while merely foreseeing the death of the foetus. It would be an unfortunate side effect. Performing an abortion, by contrast, would involve intending to kill the foetus as a means of removing risks to Martha’s health.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Evidently, the distinction involved is rather fine. In certain situations, as in a war of self defence, even when one foresees human losses, one does not intend it. It is an unfortunate and unavoidable side effect. But these are exceptions. By and large, one has to avoid unacceptable levels of collateral damage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_031.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s20" style=" background-color: #E6E7E8;">   Summary </span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_032.png"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ Since the beginning of philosophical inquiry, some thinkers have expressed deeply sceptical views about Ethics raising doubts about the value of Ethics in human life or arguing that ethical studies can have no logical foundations.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Egoism simply means that ment are only concerned with their individual advantages,</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">pleasures and welfare and have no care for others.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">¤ Psychological egoism is not a doctrine about ethical behaviour; it is a psychological theory</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">according to which men are so constituted that they always act in their selfish  interest.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ Ethical egoism is the view that people should in fact act according to their self interest.

But there is no objective standard of morality which transcends individual cultures and which can serve as basis for evaluating individual cultures.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ In brief, determinism holds that the decisions and actions of human beings are causally determined by external forces. Men are not autonomous agents who can decide on their own. They have no free will or independent volition.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ Determinism creates a problem for morality because if human beings have no free will and if their actions are all causally determined, then they cannot be held responsible for their actions.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ Men are acting freely when there are no external constraints or internal compulsions on them.
