Conflict of interest in the public sector arises when (a) offtcial duties, (b) public interest, and (c) personal  interest are taking priority one above the other. How can this conflict be resolved? Describe with an example.</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 326pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(150 Words/ 10 marks)</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;    text-align: justify;">Ans. <span class="p">Conflict of interest arises when a public servant’s official duties and/or public interest and his personal interest collide. Ordinarily, there will be no disharmony between an official’s duties and publicinterest. Democracies ensure that duties of public servants are aligned to laws and norms and to furthering public well being. But in repressive regimes officials may be forced to enforce laws and policies detrimental to public interest. However, this type of conflict is not part of the conventional meaning of conflict of interest. Commonly, it refers to a clash between personal interest and official duties.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">A has to decide a land dispute in which his close relative is interested.

Officers often face these temptations. An officer may give undue help to an industrial group known to him. He may give in to a minister’s pressure to twist policies against public good. Officials may condone wrong deeds of powerful individuals. Instead of tendering honest, objective advice, they may try to please their political masters.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">Two young customs officials visiting Goa check into government guest house.

CSR schemes will improve health, education, and skill development in the company’s neighborhoods. Their beneficial impact will create synergy between the company’s operations and locally available skill set and enterprise. Company will reap benefits of external economies which CSR thus creates.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Further, CSR programmes can reduce local poverty and improve local environment and infrastructure. Although the initial spin off is from company to the local area, it will after a time lag redound to the company’s advantage. It creates a harmonious setting for a company’s working and builds trust with local people. This will reduce transaction costs and boost profits.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: justify;">Thus CSR can promote social and economic growth which increases public and private expenditure creatinggreaterprofit makingopportunities.Inthismanner,CSR willincrease environmental quality and company’s economic sustainability. <span class="s6">(168 words)</span></p><p class="s96" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -43pt;    text-align: justify;">5. <span class="s94">(a) “Great ambition is the passion of a great character.

They are rigid, single minded and hard driving in pursuing their objectives. If their aims are noble and their methods moral and humane, their actions result in great progress. Contrarily, if their goals are base and if their methods are cruel and inhumane, their actions bring about ruin, desolation and enormous human misery.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">Hitler was an evil dictator.

Children are impressionable, and the ethical ideas they imbibe influence them throughout life. Their moral character is formed in childhood and early youth. This is the meaning of Wordsworth’s observation that child is the father of man.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Teachers and parents are uniquely placed to shape the thoughts and morals of children. Children share a strong bond of love with their parents, and are particularly receptive to parental influence. If parents rear children in a moral environment and instill values and virtues in them, children will become ideal citizens.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Children have a natural respect for teachers. Teachers acquaint children with natural and social worlds. They regale children with stories, dramas, songs, poems and stirring stories from history. They can inculcate a sense of pride and morality in children by teaching them about our national culture and ethos. Thus parents and teachers through acculturation of children can produce a moral citizenry. <span class="s6">(166 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align:justify; ">6.

It aims at maintaining peaceful and friendly relations between nations, avoiding wars, and ensuring international security.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">Historyhas been marked by incessant wars between nations and resultant destruction and disruptions. UN and League of Nations earlier were created to end wars and to peacefully settledisputes between nations. Still,the scourge of war has not vanished.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">The first goal of a nation’s external policy should be to protect its interests, but to avoid wars. No society can prosper or live in comfort without internal and external peace. Peaceful conditions should be permanent so that nations and their citizens have a sense of lasting security. To this end, international arrangements should prevent chances of frequent outbreaks of violence.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;    text-align: justify;">While this goal is desirable, no nation can neglect its defence.

This is the essence of materialist and consumerist creeds. Chasing various material pleasures becomes the goal of life. This brings an individual into conflict with a broader conception of good life which centres on pursuit of virtue, helping others, cultivating the mind and followingphilosophical, literary and artisticinterests. When an individual makes moral choices, he has to jettison alluring opportunities for material gain and pleasure. An honest public servant has to shun the temptation of illegally making money. In sticking to his official code, he has to forgo chances of ‘high living’ which is central to narrow conceptions of good life. A good life in a narrow sense could mean living comfortably without worries, strains and stresses. This could lead officers to give up principles in order to avoid conflicts with politicians, seniors, and influential people. Thus narrow perceptions of good life have contributed to erosion of moral values. </span><span class="s6">(166 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -25pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) Increased national wealth did not result in equitable distribution of its beneftts.

Agricultural growth was achieved by increased irrigation, and by use of Green Revolution technology relying on hybrid seeds and fertilizer use. As agricultural land ownership was unequal, this growth benefited the rich landlords.

To this day, most of the employment is generated in the informal sector with low wages, insecure jobs, and non-existent labour welfare provisions. Trickle-down theories falsely argued that benefits will gradually reach the poor. Efforts were made from the Fourth Plan onwards to help the poor by increasing their income by creating employment and income earning opportunities. Despite these, many Indians are poor in terms of income, assets, HDI and general deprivation. Many enclaves of wealth and modernity in cities like Mumbai, NRC, and Bengaluru stand out amidst extensive poverty and deprivation. <span class="s6">(167 words)</span></p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -43pt;    text-align: left;">8.

They are objective, impersonal and rule bound. Their structure is pyramidical with many layers. Each level is answerable to one above it, and controls those below it.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;">While these create a chain of command ensuring discipline and accountability, they can be dysfunctional. Excessive discipline saps initiative of officials. ’Discipline and punish’ approach puts officials on guard and creates inhibitions and diffidence in them.
