Changes in theory and contemporary events contributed to this trend. The new topics which now figure on discussions of international morality are the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Transfer of resources from rich countries to less developed nations</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">¤ Removing inequities in economic exchanges (trade, commerce and finance) between developed and less developed countries</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Giving greater voice to developed countries in the working of international agencies</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Humanitarian assistance to countries in the grip of famine andimmiserization</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Intervention in states which carry out genocide, ethnic cleansing or war on their own people</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Naturalization of people who migrate into a country and settle there</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Adopting a cosmopolitan as opposed to a national approach to morals.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We will discuss these questions in the rest of the chapter.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark903">International Economic Equity: Promoting Equitable Development</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The world is divided into a few rich and many poor nations. During the imperialist phase of the world history, many poor nations were the colonies of the rich nations. The poverty of the poor countries is largely due to the exploitation of the imperialist nations. While the imperialist nations progressed economically, the poor countries stagnated. The historically unequal relations between the rich and poor nations have got embedded into the international economic system, and continue to persist in new forms.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Many international economic institutions are under the hegemony of the rich nations. These nations dominate the management structures of the international institutions such as IMF, World Bank and WTO, and significantly influence their policies and processes. International morality in the economic sphere impliesthat rich nations should helpthepoor nations. Such help can consist of providing concessional economic aid, changing the international economy to the advantage of the poor, and giving the poor nations a greater representation in the international economic institutions. Many of these questions form part of international economic relations. They are in the agenda of “North south dialogue” which refers to the negotiations between the rich and poor nations on economic matters.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The disparities between North and South or the gap between rich and poor has doubled in the recent decades. Presently, 20% of world’s people consume more than 80% of its wealth. During the 1980s, per capita incomes declined in many developing countries especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty, famine, and disease remain widespread. Third World countries cannot cope with these problems, and in a global economy they need help from the industrial North.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_596.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Economic development has a moral component in that it enhances the quality of life. Ideally, development promotes a suitable environment for people to develop their full potential and lead productive and creative lives. This also underlies the ethical end of human self realisation. As a prerequisite to this end, development has to generate employment, and provide social services covering health, education and sanitation. Rich nations have a moral duty to help the poor nations in their developmental efforts.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">After the Second World War, there was a general recognition that peace requires economic integration between nations. Multilateral institutions like the World Bank, and IMF were set up around that time to promote international cooperation and assistance. This architecture exists till this day. Initially, the multilateral institutions had two goals: helping in the post war reconstruction of the war ravaged countries; and promoting development in poor countries. Afterwards, some rich nations created their own agencies for aiding poor countries. Many NGOs were also active advocates of aid to poor nations.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">The ideal way of assisting the development efforts of poor nations is through grants which have no repayment obligations. Soft loans with low interest and long repayment period come next. International aid or official development assistance (ODA) is a grant from donor nations to poor countries. Unlike loans, it places no burden on its recipients.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">The developed nations made certain commitments to assist the poor countries. The World Council of Churches in 1958 called on the rich countries to allocate 1 percent of their national income as aid for developing countries. The Development Assistance Group of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) later endorsed this recommendation. UN General Assembly in 1970 agreed to a target of 0.7 percent. But very few rich countries are meeting this target.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part286.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part288.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
