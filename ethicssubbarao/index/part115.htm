There is a tendency to use the two terms interchangeably. Codes of ethics usually contain general values while codes of conduct clearly spell out the principles which are derived from values. Inthe words of Jeremy Bentham, a principle is “a general law or rule that guides behaviour or decisions,” whereasvaluesarticulate “anaspirationof anidealmoral state.”</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">On the connection between values and principles in the domain of public administration, Terry Cooper says:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_248.png"/></span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;    text-align: justify;">An ethical principle is a statement concerning the conduct or state of being that is required for the fulfilment of a value; it explicitly links a value with a general mode of action. For example, justice may be considered a significant value, but the term itself does not tell us what rule for conduct or state of society would follow if we include justice in our value system. We wouldneed aprinciple of justice to show us what pattern of actionwould reflect justice as a value. A common form of the justice principle is “Treat equals equally and unequals unequally<span class="p">”.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;    text-align:justify; ">We might interpret this principle as meaning that all adult citizens have to be treated alike with the same political rights and obligations. If one is allowed to vote, then all must be allowed to vote. Nowadays many companies post ethical codes on their websites. They do not often distinguish</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">between a code of ethics and a code of conduct. A code of ethics will first specify values that underlie the code and will describe a company’s obligations to its stakeholders. It will describe how the company conducts its business. It will describe the manner in which the company proposes to implement its values and vision. It will guide the staff about the company’s ethical standards and on how to achieve them. In contrast, a code of conduct is generally addressed to and meant for the use of employees alone. It usually lists unacceptable behaviours or actions; employees have to obey the code; and it may be silent on values.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Values are general moral obligations; principles are the expected ethical conditions or behaviours whichfollowfromvalues.Values refer to political andsocial visionsand exaltedgoalswhich societies seek to achieve. In contrast, codes of conduct have a narrow focus. Codes of conduct are particular rules of conduct either imposed from higher levels of an organization or voluntarily accepted as the requirements of a profession or occupation.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">A code of ethics differs from a code of conduct in another way. A code of ethics or a code of morality has a wide canvas. It may virtually cover all aspects of a man’s life. It will contain prescriptions and prohibitions which cover one’s personal, social, economic, political and religious life. Codes of ethics apply to the culture, education, and religion of a whole society. Codes of conduct generally cover an individual’s official or professional conduct.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part114.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part116.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
