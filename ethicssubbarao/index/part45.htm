They date back to Vedic period and have gone through a long period of evolution. They come from many sources, such as Vedas, Upanishads, Dharmasastras, Puranas, epics, itihasas and the like. Hindu doctrinal content has not been consolidated in a single text – though <span class="s5">Bhagavat Gita </span>comes closest to it. Hindu scriptures have received varying interpretations. Hindu saints and reformers altered many Hindu practices. However, we will briefly outline what are commonly considered the central Hindu doctrines with a focus on their moral content.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark114">Four Principal Moral Ends</a></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We can begin with the Hindu conception of the four principal moral ends of life — <span class="s5">Dharma </span>(moral law), <span class="s5">Artha </span>(wealth), <span class="s5">ftama </span>(desire), and <span class="s5">Moksha </span>(salvation). The moral ends enable men to lead a happy moral life and also attain salvation after death. <span class="s5">Dharma </span>signifies the rational control of human passions, appetites and desires. <span class="s5">Dharma </span>is the correct way in which a human being has to fulfil his personal, social and moral needs.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Commentators hold two views on the nature of <span class="s5">dharma </span>or moral law. Some hold that it is a command of God. God’s prescriptions cover moral actions; God’s prohibitions refer to evil deeds which men should avoid. Other writers consider that moral law is an imperative which men have to follow without exceptions. It is not embodied in God; it is, however, a moral ideal which transcends the physical world of space and time. In fact, its moral perfection lies beyond human reach; men can only strive towards that moral ideal. As we shall see, the general and specific duties of men in common life are found in Varnashrama dharma.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Artha <span class="s6">and </span>Kama</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_093.png"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Before considering <span class="s5">dharma </span>in more detail in the form of virtuous behaviour, we may outline the concepts of <span class="s5">Artha </span>and <span class="s5">ftama</span>. <span class="s5">Artha </span>in the sense of wealth stands for material means of well being. A householder needs a minimum of wealth to maintain his family and to meet its wholesome desires. <span class="s5">Artha </span>is not an endorsement of the greed at the root of an acquisitive society. It recognises the need for money to ensure a minimum living standard and to pursue artistic and aesthetic activities.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Although <span class="s5">ftama </span>is desire, one can regard it as happiness arising from satisfaction of wants. The reference is not to endless desires but to those which are common to men living within family. They need not be the wants of the individual but of the whole family including children. In Hindu ethics happiness is subordinated to dharma or virtue. Moral conduct creates <span class="s5">Punya </span>or beneficial Karmic effect. Bad conduct creates <span class="s5">papa </span>or evil karmic effects. <span class="s5">Punya </span>leads one to heaven and <span class="s5">papa </span>to hell. But these states of existence seem impermanent since men will be reborn after their <span class="s5">papa </span>or <span class="s5">Punya </span>lapse.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dharma <span class="s6">and </span>Moksha</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Dharma <span class="s19">in its form as virtue is the ultimate value or the end in itself. It resembles the summum bonum of the Aristotelian philosophy. The ultimate goal of Hindu religion is that soul should be liberated from the constraints of the physical world and its myriad problems. In this state, human soul transcends its empirical self and loses its worldly content. Although it is difficult to visualize this state, it can be thought of as soul without the troubles, anxieties and disturbances which characterize its earthly existences.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Moksha <span class="s19">is conceived somewhat differently by different writers. </span>Moksha <span class="s19">means that the self lives in its pure spiritual form or essence. It is free from the encumbrances of the physical world of senses or of the material universe of space and time. Soul loses its vital and intellectual properties which it had while inhabiting the body. It becomes eternal and immortal. In Sankara’s interpretation, the soul merges with </span>Brahman<span class="s19">. Ramanuja says that it is in essential community with God. It realises infinite beatitude in God.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark115">Varnashrama Dharma</a></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The above account of Hindu ethics, it is clear, relates to the individual, the way he should enjoy his earthly existence within the bounds of <span class="s5">dharma </span>and prepare himself for <span class="s5">Moksha</span>. Hinduism also has an ethic which links an individual’s morals to his membership of a social group. It is the famous <span class="s5">Varnashrama dharma</span>. In this version, society is divided into four occupational groups. The Brahmins have to master Vedas, practise religious ceremonies, and promote  spiritualism in society. They are the guardians of the society’s academic and spiritual traditions. The <span class="s5">ftashtriyas </span>are the warrior class. They have to acquire military skills and defend the society against internal and external threats. The <span class="s5">Vaishyas </span>are the trading community who has to carry on commerce and industry. The <span class="s5">Shudras </span>are the artisans and craftsmen who create the amenities of civilization.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Apart from the morals arising from one’s station in society, there are duties which have to be performed at different stages of life. Thus a student (<span class="s5">Brahmachari</span>) has to lead a pure, chaste life,</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">learn Vedas, and imbibe knowledge from teachers. A man has to marry and raise a family for his happiness and social good. In the next stage of <span class="s5">Vanaprastha</span>, one has to dedicate himself to solitary prayer and meditation. In the final stage, man has to become a wandering monk (<span class="s5">sanyasin</span>), living on alms and devoting himself to service to society and God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_094.png"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Obviously, the occupational patterns of society today scarcely resemble those of ancient India. The point that is still valid is that one has to faithfully work in one’s field of occupation. Thus, a soldier, fire officer or a teacher has clearly demarcated duties. As for the duties appropriate to different life stages, they have to be adopted with due regard to the enormous changes which the ancient society has undergone. The stage-of-life duties have to be related to the context of the modern society.</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Countless volumes have appeared on caste in India. They are generally very critical of caste system. That the caste system has created divisions among Hindus is a fact which received constant emphasis from leaders of national movement and religious reformers. Mahatma Gandhi in particular worked hard for removing the practice of untouchability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part44.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part46.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
