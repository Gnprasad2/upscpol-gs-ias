After Rajesh Chaudhary got into the civil service, they got married. Vaidehi’s father was a prominent politician who lived in the State capital. But the young couple did not publicise the fact and kept a low profile. Vaidehi’s father did not want to entangle Rajesh Chaudhary in any political matters. After a few field postings, Rajesh was transferred to the State capital. The young couple moved into Vaidehi’s parental home.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Being a politician’s home, it had a stream of political visitors. Rajesh initially kept himself away from the political crowd. But then he slowly became interested in the political gossip. He began mixing with the more prominent and interesting politicians. He began telling some juicy bits of political news to his service colleagues in their tea club–the time civil servants take off for official gossip. He also helped out a few politicians in some minor cases. Some of them made frivolous comments about the ‘synergy’ which marriage ties between families of bureaucrats and politicians can create. Vaidehi was none too pleased. Being a politician’s daughter, she had sharp antenna and did not want Rajesh to be identified with any political formation. She did not want him to land in any trouble. Her father was also wary of Rajesh getting mixed up with his political pals for many of them were dubious characters. But he was hesitant to say anything to his son-in-law.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Fortunately, the matter got naturally resolved.Rajesh Chadhary’syounger sister got admission in a well known business school in the city. Vaidehi persuades Rajesh to move to their small official flat which is close to the school. She tells him that his sister can study peacefully in the flat. Her father also heaves a sigh of relief.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark358">Question</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What in your view can be an appropriate response to the situation depicted in the case?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Vaidehi is making a mountain of a molehill.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. The couple should not have, in the first instance, moved into Vaidehi’s parental home.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Vaidehi’s concerns are valid.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. Civil servants cannot avoid involvement in some measure with politicians and their activities<span class="s25">.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark359">Discussion</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The first alternativeis unacceptable.Thereis a problemsinceRajesh is developingexcessiveproximity with political leaders. This can create problems for him in his career in future.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The second alternative is not relevant to the issue. The problem is not that they moved into the residence of Vaidehi’s parents. It is that Rajesh is getting very close to politicians whereas civil servants need to maintain some distance from them.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The whole matter may seem innocuous. But the catch is that Rajesh is getting sucked into the political arena. We are fond of listening to political gossip as the popularity ratings of political news channels attest. But civil servants have to stay away from political matters. Rajesh is young and can be led astray by political operators. Though a politician, his father-in-law was aware of the danger.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Vaidehi shrewdly realised that her husband’s excessive political interests may undermine his neutral image. Her anxieties are well-founded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_263.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The last alternative makes a misleading statement. It is true that politicians and civil servants interact constantly with one another. But this should not be seen as involvement of civil servants in political affairs. Theirrole is different from that of political leaders. In their interactions with political leaders, officials should be politically neutral and avoid getting into political matters of any sort.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark360">Observing Social Laws and Cultural Norms</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Civil servants should meticulously follow certain social laws which people seldom observe. They should neither accept nor offer dowry. Nor should they contract a bigamous marriage, even when permissible under a religious personal law, except with government’s prior sanction. They should not engage persons below 14 years of age for household work.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Civil servants have to observe certain cultural norms in their personal capacity. These cover the existing policies regarding age of marriage; preservation of the environment, wild life and cultural heritage; prevention of crimes against women; and the two children family norm.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Civil servants should never be under influence of alcohol while on duty; nor should they allow or permit an addiction to drink and drugs to affect their work. They have to scrupulously observe prohibition laws that may be in force in any State.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part123.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part125.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
