Envy is the daughter of pride, the author of murder and revenge, the beginner of secret sedition and the perpetual tormentor of virtue. Envy is the filthy slime of the soul; a venom, a poison, or quicksilver which consumes the flesh and dries up the marrow of the bones.” —Socrates <span class="p">Envy is resentment of others for their wealth and success.

An envious person wishes ill of others. He is unable to bear their success and happiness. Often, he is unable to take active measures for harming others. But their very success and happiness become the source of his misery. Envy arises when another gets what one has tried to unsuccessfully to acquire. People seek degrees, jobs, power and money. When they find that they have been unable to get such things, and that others have got them deservedly or otherwise, they become jealous.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Jealousy is a source of great unhappiness. It is a wholly negative emotion, and yields no advantage. In modern world people live in a highly competitive enviornment. Success in any field is highly valued. Even when people are otherwise well off with a comfortable job, they are in a rat race. It is one thing to be committed and industrious. But the competitive environment creates situations in which rewards in professions and jobs are unevenly distributed. Competition and heartburn are especially high among individuals who are within similar groups. They compare themselves with others and feel envy whenever others seem to be going ahead of them. Competition extends to the education and career of children also. This attitude creates an unhealthy mental atmosphere.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Envy goes against the moral injunction that we should love our neighbours. Religions preach that one should love even one’s enemies. Envy is basically irrational since the riches or poverty of another make no difference to our condition. We are in no way affected by what happens to others. It does not increase or diminish our wealth. Hence, manythinkers and writers advise that we should eschew envy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part89.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part91.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
