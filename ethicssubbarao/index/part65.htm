The details of his life are not known with any great historical authenticity. Tiruvalluvar was born in Tamilnadu perhaps in Mylapore of present- day Chennai. Tiruvalluvar was a householder who probably worked under a king. According to some legends, he was a weaver. His wife’s name is Vasuki.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Tiruvalluvar’s fame rests on his great work <span class="s5">Thirukkural</span>. Scholars are divided on the period of its composition. The commonly accepted period of Tiruvalluvar is 2<span class="s42">nd </span>century AD. Thirukkural is assigned to this period because Tiruvalluvar seems to have borrowed ideas from Arthasastra ( 250 B.C. 150 A.D.) and because the two Tamil epics <span class="s5">Manimekhalai </span>and <span class="s5">Silappadikaram </span>(200-500AD) contain references to Tirukkural’s couplets. However, 31 B.C. is the year of Tiruvalluvar’s birth as accepted by the Tamil Academy of Madurai.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite its antiquity, Thirukkural reflects humane, refined and universal moral values. The following observations of Albert Schweitzer contained in his book ‘<span class="s5">Indian Thought and Its Development</span>’ (1951) are worth recalling in this context:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_157.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">“<span class="s5">With sure strokes the ftural draws the ideal of simple ethical humanity. On the most varied questions concerning the conduct of man to himself and to the world its utterances are characterised by nobility and good sense. There hardly existsinthe literature of the worlda collectionof maximsinwhichwe find so muchloftywisdom</span>”.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Thirukkural consists of three parts covering:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) virtues;</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) worldliness; and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c) love.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Thirukkural contains 133 chapters, each containing 10 couplets, thus making a total of 1330 couplets. Virtue is accordedthe highest priority in Thirukkural.The chapters on virtue and love (<span class="s5">inbam</span>) deal with ethical living in private life. <span class="s5">Porul </span>or wealth deals with public affairs. Virtue is discussed in 380 verses, worldliness in 700 stanzas and love (<span class="s5">Inbam</span>) in 250 verses. A general idea of the contents of Thirukkural can be had by looking at the couplets and the topics they cover: 40 couplets are on God, Rain, Virtue and Ascetics, 200 couplets on Domestic Virtue, 140 couplets on Higher Virtue based on Grace, 250 couplets on Royalty, 100 couplets on Ministers of State, 220 couplets on the Essential requirements of Administration, 130 couples on Morality, both positive and negative, and 250 couplets on Human Love and Passion.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: left;">In what follows, we cite a few quotations from Thirukkural to convey the spirit of its moral sentiments. After paying homage to ascetics, Tiruvalluvar emphasises family and personal virtue. On Virtue</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“Rage, Envy, Greed and Harsh words Avoided is virtue.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: left;">Hepraisesthequalitiesof affability,gratitude,self-control,right conduct andfaithfulnessinthe first section of Virtue. Extolling the significance of vegetarianism he says:</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“How can one be kindly? If he fattens on other’s fat?”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: left;">He also expresses the Christian idea that one should forgive one’s enemies, and return evil with good.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark216">“Punish a sinner by paling him With a good deed, and forget.”</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On Love and family</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tiruvalluvar’s idealism leads him to lavishly praise feminine virtue:</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If woman might of chastity retain, What choicer treasure doth the world contain</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">AlthoughTiruvalluvar discusses romantic love, he preaches that it should culminate in married life. For it sets out the commitments and responsibilities of the couple towards each other and towards their families and society at large. Tiruvalluvar places high value on family life, and the joys of raising children. Professor C.R. Krishnamurti in <span class="s5">Thamizh Literature Through the Ages </span>observes, “These verses would be particularly relevant today when genuine commitment between married couples is gradually becoming conspicuous by its absence. One also wonders at what point in history the financial and religious inputs began to creep into the matrimonial relationships in the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Thamizh social fabric!” As an aside, we may note that all over India religious inputs in matrimonial relationships are waning while financial inputs are growing.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark217">On the Importance of Wealth</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_158.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Tiruvalluvar recognises the supreme value of virtue, but thinks that without wealth it becomes impracticable. The following couplet shows how a poor man’s thoughts will get fixated on the spectre of hunger.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“Will that hunger return? Which nearly killed me yesterday?”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Simultaneously, Tiruvalluvar finds fault with avarice and miserliness:</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“He is poor though a millionaire Who neither gives nor spends.”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;    text-align: justify;">Tiruvalluvar emphasises that worldly wisdom or prudence is necessary to live in harmony in society. One needs to get along well with fellow men.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark218">On Politics &amp; Governance</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tiruvalluvar hasmade many wiseobservations on statecraft. He discussestherelationshipbetween theking, his ministers andsubjects. He highlights theimportance of learning, agriculture and social service. He denounces corruption and nepotism, the evils of current politics, as evil and unwise. His prescription for a thriving society is based on a blend of personal character, social conduct and state action.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark219">On Moral Enforcement</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many moral thinkers advocate harsh morality and rigid enforcement of morals. Idealistic morals have to make allowance for common human weaknesses, and to the exigencies of real life. Tiruvalluvar takes this fact into account, and recognises the need for some exceptions from moral norms. He gives an instance where uttering a falsehood may be justified.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Falsehood may take the place of truthful word If blessing from fault it can afford</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark220">Literary aspects</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We may note a few other significant points about Thirukkural. According to Tamil scholars, its composition is marked by great literary beauty. The expressions used for describing human emotions areverydelicate.Various aspects of love are described in a subtlemanner.Tiruvalluvar nevermisses an opportunity of cautioning people against unchaste behaviour.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="s5">Sacred Couplets is considered a masterpiece of human thought, compared in India and abroad to the Bible, John Milton’s Paradise Lost, and the works of Plato. The Thirukkural is an all inclusive moral guide whose foremost</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">moral imperatives are not to kill and to tell the truth<span class="p">” (Webster’s Encyclopaedia of Literature)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Tiruvalluvar’s poetry reflects his moral seriousness, depth of conviction and his understanding of human psychology. His thinking is catholic and free from religious dogmatism. It is a matter of great wonderthat Tiruvalluvar, who lived so long back in history,expressedsuchliberal and sublime thoughts. He was far, far ahead of his times.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the end, we include a list of pithy sayings from Tiruvalluvar:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Something may not be achievable even by God or through God’s help. But the effort exerted to attain that non-achievable will yielditsdeserving result!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_159.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Though the world goes round with many activities, it is dependent on agriculture. Hence, though laborious, farming is the foremost activity.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ As water changes its nature, fromthe nature of thesoil in which it flows, so will thecharacter of men resemble that of their associates.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Friendship is not just a smile on the face; It is what is felt deep within a smiling heart.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ The stalks of water-flowers are proportionate to the depth of water; so is men’s greatness proportionate to their minds (Knowledge).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Avoid an act which you may repent later; if done by mistake, better not to repeat it.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Whatever is thought to be donewill be achieved as planned, if the plannerspossess firmness in execution.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Excessive or deficient food or activity causes disorders in mobility,breathing and digestion.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Agriculturists are the linchpin of the mankind since they support all others who cannot till the soil.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ The learned teacher makes you enjoy learning; on leaving, makes you to keep thinking of his teaching.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Think and then undertake the work; to think after commencement will bring disgrace.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Determined efforts result in prosperity; idleness will bring nothing.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Defer not virtue to another day; receive her now; and at the dying hour she will be your undying friend.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Water will flow from a water well in proportion to the depth to which it is dug, and knowledge will flow from a man in proportion to his learning.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ That which God gives, nobody can ban.

However, extending this account further will lead to repetition of the earlier pattern of discussions. Our purpose is to offer a model of analysis which students can apply to their readings on other leaders, rulers and reformers. Students need to learn about all such prominent figures and make short notes about them in the form of bullet points.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s20" style=" background-color: #E6E7E8;">   Summary </span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ This chapter is about lives of leaders, reformers and administrators.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ We interpret leaders to mean national leaders of freedom movement.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Students would be reading about them while covering Independence movement and polity.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ We interpret administrators to mean able Indian rulers from ancient, medieval and modern times.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ We interpret reformers as social, moral and religious reformers. These are transformational figures that reshape the moral values and worldview of the society.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ As it is impossible to cover all important leaders, reformers and administrators, we have selected a few for discussion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_160.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Students need to take notes whenever they come across such personalitiesin their reading.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Their lives have to be studied in the background of human values.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Human values can be individual values – linked with man’s bodily self, social self and spiritual self.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Human values can also be interpreted as universal values found in all societies, religions and periods.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Five such human values are - truth, right conduct, love, peace and non-violence.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Human values can have another meaning as recognizing human rights. Humanism as a doctrine placed man at the centre of discussion in philosophy, morals and humanities. It focuses on human happiness, human concerns and human freedom and achievement.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Human beings have to be always treated as ends in themselves and not as means to any putative higherend.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Humanism rejects religious ideas, affirms autonomy of human reason and man’s duty to chalk out independently the paths of self development and social progress.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Religious discourse may often focus on spiritual exercises, theological or doctrinal questions and on external religious observances. Sometimes, religious leaders promote narrow outlook, bigotry and sectarian intolerance. We have to steer clear of such views. Religious approaches have to promote feelings of common humanity, human fraternity, social equality and mutual tolerance.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Vivekananda fused Hindu Vedantic ideals with Western scientific and humanistic thought. He worked against the tendency of Hindus to devote themselves to exclusive sects and doctrines. He reminded Indians of their glorious traditions. He popularized Vedanta philosophy in the West. Above all, he reminded people of the need to help the masses submerged in poverty and ignorance.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ The great contributions of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa are: establishing the possibility of directlyexperiencing God;preaching of harmony of religions; harmonizingancient religious practices with modern secular life; discounting the abuses which have entered religions; and improving the tone of morality in social life. His thoughts are free from obscurantism.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Aurobindo’s writings boosted the morale of the nation still in bondage. They lifted the feeling of despondency, gloom and inferiority from the minds of people living in subjugation to a foreign power. Aurobindo reminded people of the nation’s glorious past. There is nothing narrow or chauvinistic in Aurobindo’s thoughts. His message of spiritual self enlightenment based on deep internal meditation is addressed to the whole humanity.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ Ram Mohan Roy possessed an acute mind, broad religious sympathies, a very powerful personality and great drive for reforms. Both his range of interests and sphere of activities werewide. He fought relentlesslyagainst the abusesandcorruptpracticesthat creptintothe once healthy body of Hindu doctrine. He looked beyond India’s political downfall, loss of independence and humiliation. He looked towards a radiant future based on absorption of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Western culture and democratic discipline. He was a true believer in the equality of sexes and toiled to raise the status of women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_161.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ Dayananda Saraswati gave the slogan: “back to Vedas”. He was an iconoclast who opposed the traditional rituals of Hinduism, idol worship, conventional priesthood and the caste barriers. He was a great practical reformer who built many institutions and promoted many constructive activities.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ Narayana Guru was a great spiritual master. He taught religious tolerance and social harmony. His teachings have a social orientation. He was concerned about the plight of the poor and the downtrodden and worked for their welfare.

His works popularized Indian cultural thoughts in many parts of the world. He is the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize. Though famous as a poet, he also wrote novels, short stories, dramas, articles, essays and was a painter too. His songs, known as <span class="s5">Rabindrasangeet </span>are very popular in Bengal.

These are seen as means to strong nation building.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">¤ The “appearance of Guru Ravidas in the spiritual arena of India in the fifteenth century was a turning point in Indian history”. The acceptance by masses of the son of a cobbler as a spiritual guru represents the final culmination of the <span class="s5">Bhakti movement</span>.

Guru Nanak had great respect for women, allowed them to participate fully in all religious gatherings and accorded them full share in religious functions.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Guru Nanak created the <span class="s5">Gurumukhi </span>script by simplifying the Sanskrit characters.

Purity of life, obedience to Guru, mercy, charity, temperance, justice, straightforwardness, truthfulness, sacrifice, service, love and abstinence from animal food are among the virtues on which great emphasis is laid; while lust, anger, pride, hatred, egoism, greed, selfishness, cruelty, backbiting and falsehood are strongly condemned.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Besides moral earnestness and simplicity, syncretism, Catholicism and liberalism are the other admirable attributes of Guru Nanak’s teaching.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Tiruvalluvar was a great poet, preacher and thinker.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">¤ Tiruvalluvar’s fame rests on his great work Thirukkural. Scholars are divided on the period of its composition. The commonly accepted period of Tiruvalluvar is 2<span class="s42">nd </span>century AD.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">¤ Thirukkural consists of three parts covering: a) virtues; b) worldliness; and c) love.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Despite its antiquity, Thirukkural reflects humane, refined and universal moral values. It is considered a masterpiece of human thought, compared in India and abroad to the Bible, John Milton’s Paradise Lost, and the works of Plato.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">¤ Tiruvalluvar’s poetry reflects his moral seriousness, depth of conviction and his understanding of human psychology. His thinking is catholic and free from religious dogmatism. It is a matter of great wonder that Tiruvalluvar, who lived so long back in history, expressed such liberal and sublime thoughts. He was far, far ahead of his times.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PRACTICE QUESTIONS</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.
