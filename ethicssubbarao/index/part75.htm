Virtue is any excellence of character. Virtue may be defined as the acquired power or capacity for moral action. This definition implies that virtue is cultivated through moral exertion. Virtue applies to qualities exhibited in right conduct, for example, courage. Virtues–such as ‘just’, ‘liberal’, ‘brave’, etc.–are applied to persons as well as to their acts. We do not regard these attributes as belonging to acts considered apart from their agents. Virtue is primarily a permanent attribute of the moral agent. It does not really belong to the transient acts and feelings which reflect it. Virtue is regarded as a possession worth aiming at for its own sake–to be indeed a part of the perfection of man that some regard as the sole ultimate good.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The synonyms of vice are fault, depravity, sin, iniquity, wickedness, and corruption. Vice is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered immoral, depraved, or degrading. Vice also refers to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, or an infirmity. In compion usage, vice may also refer to a bad or unhealthy habit such as smoking.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Ethical texts contain long lists of virtues and vices. But analysis shows that many of these are not separate and distinct. They stand for the same moral concept. If one eliminates such common virtues and vices, their number comes down. Thus, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato recognised only four cardinal virtues – wisdom, fortitude, temperance and justice. All other virtues can be reduced to these four or shown as equivalent to them. However, we will cover a wider range of virtues recognised separately in commonparlance.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Moral philosophers have divide vices into major and minor categories. The major vices are called in religious language as deadly or mortal sins. These are anger, vanity, avarice, lust, sloth, envy and gluttony. Our discussion will cover these vices. They include virtually all the human frailties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_184.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">In this chapter, we adopted a particular style of presentation. Before starting discussion on any virtue or vice, we give a list of famous quotations on it. Each quotation expresses incisively some aspect of the virtue or the vice. Students can gain useful insights by reflecting on these quotations from great thinkers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part74.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part76.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
