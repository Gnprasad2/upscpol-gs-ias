Responding to audit comments about loss of revenue and irregularities in vehicle registration centres and at toll points, Government has introduced computer systems and CCTV cameras. A control centre was created at State headquarters with real time data and image transfer. The new system evoked strong opposition from vested interests within and outside government. Vishvambar studied English literature in his college days. He had no background of computers. The whole process, he confided to his close aides, went over his head. Fortunately, he had some officers who studied in IITs. He left the whole matter to them. When asked to visit and supervise the control room operations, he joked that the new fangled ideas are for the young and that it is difficult to teach new tricks to an old dog.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark866">Question</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Selectoneofthefollowinganswerchoicesandgivereasonswhyyouaccept orreject ananswerchoice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_565.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. Vishvambar is over delegating. Technicalities need to be managed by specialist professionals but he should know what’s and why’s of every important step or decision related to the project from management perspective.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. In a responsible position such as Vishvambar is holding, the leader has a duty to be passionate about major projects going on in the Department. By that test he is failing.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. Government has made a blunder in posting an officer with academic background in literature into such technicallyintensivejob as that of thetransport commissioner.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">4. Only (1) and (2)</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark867">Discussion</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Answer choice (1) is correct, because it is clear from the behaviour of Vishvambar that he has adopted hands off approach towards this project. Senior managers too need to ‘make their hands dirty’ – strugglingwiththe problems andthechallenges.Thisprocessincludeslearning newsubjects (at least at the basic level) and acquiring new skill set. Apparently Vishvambar is unwilling to do that for IT application in his department.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Obviouslythe project is an important one which is expected to bringtransparency in functioning of the department, reduce corruption and enhance state’s revenue. He cannot avoid thinking about the problems involved in IT application in his department because there are a few IITian employees working for him. A project like this needs consideration not only of technical dimensions but also others such as convenience of public in general in transacting business in the new format or system and elimination of touts from the department. These matters concern general administration and IT interface with people will be guided by these considerations. Vishvambar is failing to appreciate how much a person who has eyes and ears open and acquaintance with affairs of common man’s life can contribute to the development of a good web based platform. He can make that contribution only when he appreciates how the technology works. He does not have to become a designer or software code writer for that purpose. In the context, therefore, his hands off approach is far from being responsible.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In view of the discussion in the previous two paragraphs the answer choice (2) is also correct.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Answer choice (3) is definitely wrong. Academic background should not be the dominant consideration in appointment of senior executives in Government. Yes, extraordinary achievement in some field of relevance can and should be taken into account. There is no principle that a person with literature or liberal arts background in University cannot be placed in a department which has an IT intensive project. There have been many distinguished civil servants who have done exceptionally well in a field in which she or he did not have previous exposure. It all depends on motivation and passionate application. Background is never an insurmountable barrier for achievers in management or civil services. Thus answer choice (3) is incorrect.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hence (4)</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark868">Programmes for Poor</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_566.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We have so far discussed how emotional intelligence is necessary for increasing organisational efficiency in the new knowledge-based global business environment. There is, however, another aspect which is relevant to organizing and implementing welfare programmes for the deprived groups. Government servants implement the programmes according to the prescribed guidelines. But mere mechanical efficiency is inadequate for successful implementation of these programmes. They need to show personal commitment to ensure that such programmes succeed. They have to put their heart and soul into the effort. Programmes for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, women and children fall into this category.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">These programmes are hard to design and execute. Unlike other sectoral programmes, these lack adequate infrastructure, committed and knowledgeable staff and suffer from low visibility. They lack glamour. Government servants find it much harder to implement these programmes than those in infrastructure or industry. This is true of all social and poverty alleviation programmes. The client groups are poor, illiterate and unorganized. Unlike industrialists or project developers, they have neither initiative nor drive. They can confer no benefits of any sort on government servants. Government servants often view them as a troublesome burden, and seek transfers to other departments. This is where young officers have to display idealism and compassion even at the cost of undergoing some personal inconveniences.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part269.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part271.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
