Rakesh is a responsible district level officer, who enjoys the trust of his higher officials. Knowing his honesty, the government entrusted him with the responsibility of identifying the beneficiaries under a health care scheme meant for senior citizens.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The criteria to be a beneficiary are the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) 60 years of age or above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) Belonging to a reserved community.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c) Family income of less than 1 Lakh rupees per annum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(d) Post-treatment prognosis is likely to be high to make a positive difference to the quality of life of the beneficiary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">One day, an old couple visited Rakesh’s office with their application. They have been the residents of a village in his district since their birth. The old man is diagnosed with a rare condition that causes obstruction in the large intestine. As a consequence, he has severe abdominal pain frequently that prevents him from doing any physical labour. The couple has no children to support them. The expert surgeon whom they contacted is willing to do the surgery without charging any fee. However, the couple will have to bear the cost of incidental charges, such as medicines, hospitalization, etc., to the tune of rupees one lakh. The couple fulfils all the criteria except criterion ‘b’. However, any financial aid would certainly make a significant difference in their quality of life.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How should Rakesh respond to the situation? <i>(250 words)</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">2. As a senior officer in the Ministry, you have access to important policy decisions and upcoming big announcements such as road construction projects before they</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;">are notified in the public domain. The Ministry is about to announce a mega road project for</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">which the drawings are already in place. Sufficient care was taken by the planners to make use of the government land with the minimum land acquisition from private parties.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Compensation rate for private parties was also finalized as per government rules. Care was also taken to minimize deforestation. Once the project is announced, it is expected that there will be a huge spurt in real estate prices in and around that area.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Meanwhile, the Minister concerned insists that you realign the road in such a way that it comes closer to his 20 acres farmhouse. He also suggests that he would facilitate the purchase of a big plot of land in your wife name at the prevailing rate which is very nominal, in and around the proposed mega road project. He also tries to convince you by saying that there is no harm in it as he is buying the land legally. He even promises to supplement your savings in case you do not have sufficient funds to buy the land. However, by the act of realignment, a lot of agricultural lands has to be acquired, thereby causing a considerable financial burden on the government, and also the displacement of the farmers. As if this is not enough, it will involve cutting down of a large number of trees denuding the area of its green cover.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Faced with this situation, what will you do? Critically examine various conflicts of interest and explain what your responsibilities are as a public servant. <i>(250 words)</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. It is a State where prohibition is in force. You are recently appointed as the Super-</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">intendent of Police of a district notorious for illicit distillation of liquor. The illicit liquor leads to many death, reported and unreported, and causes a major problem for the district authorities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">The approach till now had been to view it as a law and order problem and tackle it accordingly. Raids, arrest, police cases, and criminal trials – all these had only limited impact. The problem remains as serious as ever.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Your inspections show that the parts of the district where the distillation flourishes are economically, industrially and educationally backward. Agriculture is badly affected by poor irrigation facilities. Frequent clashes among communities gave boost to illicit distillation. No major initiatives had taken place in the past either from the government’s side or from social organizations to improve the lot of the people.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Which new approach will you adopt to bring the problem under control? <i>(250 words)</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">4. A big corporate house is engaged in manufacturing industrial chemicals on a large scale. It proposes to set up an additional unit. Many states rejected its proposal due to the detrimental effect on the environment. But one state government acceded to the request and permitted the unit close to a city, brushing aside all opposition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">The unit was set up 10 years ago and was in full swing till recently. The pollution caused by the industrial effluents was affecting the land, water and crops in the area. It was also causing serious health problems to human beings and animals. This gave rise to a series of</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">agitations demanding the closure of the plant. In a recent agitation thousands of people took part, creating a law and order problem necessitating stern police action. Following the public outcry, the State government ordered the closure of the factory.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">The closure of the factory resulted in the unemployment of not only those workers who were engaged in the factory but also those who were working in the ancillary units. It also very badly affected those industry which depended on the chemicals manufactured by it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">As a senior officer entrusted with the responsibility of handling this issues, how are you going to address it? <i>(250 words)</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">5. Dr X is a leading medical practitioner in a city. He has set up a charitable trust through which he plans to establish a super-speciality hospital in the city to cater to the medical needs of all sections of the society. Incidentally, that part of the State had been neglected over the years. The proposed hospital would be a boon for the region.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">You are heading the tax investigation agency of that region. During an inspection of the doctor’s clinic, your officers have found out some major irregularities. A few of them are substantial which had resulted in considerable withholding of tax that should be paid by him now. The doctor is cooperative. He undertakes to pay the tax immediately.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">However, there are certain other deficiencies in his tax compliance which are purely technical in nature. If these technical defaults are pursued by the agency, considerable time and energy of the doctor will be diverted to issues which are not so serious, urgent or even helpful to the tax collection process. Further, in all probability, it will hamper the prospects of the hospital coming up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are two options before you:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: left;">1. Taking a broader view, ensure substantial tax compliance and ignore defaults that are merely technical in nature.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: left;">2. Pursue the matter strictly and proceed on all fronts, whether substantial or merely technical.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the head of the tax agency, which course of action will you opt and why? <i>(250 words)</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">6. Edward Snowden, a computer expert and former CIA administrator, released confidential Government documents to the press about the existence of Government surveillance programmes. According to many legal experts and the US Government, his action violated the Espionage act of 1971, which identified the leak of State secret as an act of treason. Yet, despite the fact that he broke the law, Snowden argued that he had a moral obligation to act. He gave a justification for his “whistle blowing” by stating that he had a duty “to inform the public as to that which is done in there name and that which is done against them.”</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">According to Snowden, the Government’s violation of privacy had to be exposed regardless of legality since more substantive issues of social action and public morality were involved here. Many agreed with Snowden. Few argued that he broke the law and compromised national security, for which he should be held accountable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Do you agree that Snowden’s actions were ethically justified even if legally prohibited? Why or why not? Make an argument by weighing the competing values in this case.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;">(250 words)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2017</h3><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7. You are an honest and responsible civil servant. You often observe the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(a) There is a general perception that adhering to ethical conduct one may face difficulties to oneself and cause problems for the family, whereas unfair practices may help to reach the career goals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(b) When the number of people adopting unfair means is large, a small minority having a penchant towards ethical means makes no difference.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(c) Sticking to ethical means is detrimental to the larger developmental goals</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(d) While one may not involve oneself in large unethical practices, but giving and accepting small gifts makes the system more efficient.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Examine the above statements with their merits and demerits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">8. You are aspiring to become an IAS officer and you have cleared various stages and now you have been selected for the personal interview. On the day of the interview, on the way to the venue you saw an accident where a mother and child who happen to be your relatives</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;">were badly injured. They needed immediate help.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What would you have done in such a situation? Justify your action.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">9. You are the head of the Human Resources department of an organization. One day one of the workers died on duty. His family was demanding compensation. However, the company denied compensation because it was revealed in investigation that he was drunk at the time of the accident. The workers of the company went on to strike demanding compensation for the family of the deceased. The Chairman of the management board has asked for your recommendation.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">What recommendation would you provide to the management? Discuss the merits and demerits of each of the recommendation.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">10. You are the manager of a spare parts company A and you have to negotiate a deal with the manager of a large manufacturing company B. The deal is highly competitive and sealing the deal is critical for your company. The deal is being worked out over a dinner. After dinner the manager of manufacturing company B offered to drop you to the hotel in his car. On the way to hotel he happens to hit motorcycle injuring the motorcyclist badly. You know the manager was driving fast and thus lost control. The law enforcement officer comes to</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">investigate the issue and you are the sole eyewitness to it. Knowing the strict laws pertaining to road accidents you are aware that your honest account of the incident would lead to the prosecution of the manager and as a consequence the deal is likely to be jeopardised, which is of immense importance to your company.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are the dilemmas you face? What will be your response to the situation?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">11. A building permitted for three floors, while being extended illegally to 6 floors by a builder, collapses. As a consequence, a number of innocent labourers including women and children died. These labourers are migrants of different places. The government immediately announced cash relief to the aggrieved families and arrested the builder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Give reasons for such incidents taking place across the country.

You are a Public Information Officer (PIO) in a government department. You are aware that the RTI Act 2005 envisages transparency and accountability in administration. The act has functioned as a check on the supposedly arbitrarily administrative behaviour and actions. However, as a PIO you have observed that there are citizens who filed RTI applications not for themselves but on behalf of such stakeholders who purportedly want to have access to</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">information to further their own interests. At the same time there are these RTI activists who routinely file RTI applications and attempt to extort money from the decision makers. This type of RTI activism has affected the functioning of the administration adversely and also possibly jeopardises the genuineness of the applications which are essentially aimed at getting justice.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">What measures would you suggest to separate genuine and non-genuine applications? Give merits and demerits of your suggestions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2016</h3><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">13. A fresh engineering graduate gets a job in a prestigious chemical industry. She likes the work. The salary is also good. However, after a few months she accidentally discovers that a highly toxic waste is being secretly discharged into a river nearby. This is causing health problems to the villagers downstream who depend on the river for their water needs. She is perturbed and mentions her concern to her colleagues who have been with the company for longer periods. They advise her to keep quite as anyone who mentions the topic is</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">summarily dismissed. She cannot risk losing her job as she is the sole beard-winner for her family and has to support her ailing parents and siblings. At first, she thinks that if her seniors are keeping quiet, why should she stick out her neck. But her conscience pricks her to do something to save the river and the people who depend upon it. At heart she feels that the advice of silence given by her friends is not correct though she cannot give reasons for it.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;">She thinks you are a wise person and seeks your advice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) What arguments can you advance to show her that keeping quiet is not morally right?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) What course of action would you advice her to adopt and why?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">14. Land needed for mining, dams and other largescale projects is acquired mostly from Adivasis, hill dwellers and rural communities. The displaced persons are paid monetary compensation as per the legal provisions. However, the payment is often tardy. In any case, it cannot sustain the displaced families for long. These people do not possess marketable skills to engage in some other accusation. They end up as low paid migrant laborers.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Moreover, the development goes to industries, industrialists and urban communities whereas the costs are passed on to these poor helpless people. This unjust distribution of costs and benefits is unethical.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Suppose you have been entrusted with the task of drafting a better compensation-cum- rehabilitation policy for such displaced persons, how would you approach the problem and what would be the main elements of your suggested policy?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">15. Suppose you are an officer in charge of implementing a social service scheme to provide support to old and destitute women. An old and illiterate woman comes to you to avail the benefits of the scheme. However, she has no documents to show that she fulfils the eligibility criteria. But after meeting her and listening to her you feel that she certainly needs support. Your enquiries also show that she is really destitute and living in a pitiable condition. You are in a dilemma as to what to do. Putting her under the scheme without necessary documents would clearly be violation of rules. But denying her the support would be cruel and inhuman.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) Can you think of a rational way to resolve this dilemma?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) Give your reasons for it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">16. You are a young, aspiring and sincere employee in a Government office working as an assistant to the director of your department. Since you have joined recently, you need to lean and progress. Luckily your superior is very kind and ready to train you for your job. He is a very intelligent and well-informed person having knowledge of various departments. In short, you respect your boss and are looking forward to lean a lot from him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Since you have good tuning with the boss, he started depending on you. One day due to ill health he invited you at his place for finishing some urgent work. You reached his house and before you could ring the bell you heard shouting noises. You waited for a while. After</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">entering the house the boss greeted you and explained the work. But you were constantly disturbed by the crying of a woman. At last, you inquired with the boss but his answer did not satisfy you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next day, you were compelled to inquire further in the office and found out that his behavior</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">is very bad at home with his wife. He also beats up bit wife. His wife is not well educated and is a simple woman in comparison to her husband. you see that though your boss is a nice person in the office, he is engaged in domestic violence at home.

ABC Ltd. is a large transnational company having diversified business activities with a huge shareholder base. The company is continuously expanding the generating employment. The company, in its expansion and diversification programme, decides to establish a new plant at Vikaspuri, an area which is underdeveloped.

She soon discovered that she has to seek permission from a number of Government agencies. The rules and procedures were quite confusing and cumbersome. What frustrated her most were</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">delays, callous attitude of officials and constant demand for bribes.

There is a disaster-prone State having frequent landslides, forest fires, cloudbursts, flash floods and earthquakes, etc. Some of these are seasonal and often unpredictable. The magnitude of the disaster is always unanticipated. During one of the seasons, a cloudburst caused devastating floods and landslides leading to high casualties. There was major damage to infrastructure like roads, bridges and power generating units. This led to more than 100000 pilgrims, tourists and other locals trapped across different routes and locations.

A visit is scheduled during which he will visit the site along with the chief engineer and the senior architect. He wants you to check out all the papers relating to it and to ensure that the visit is properly arranged. You examine the file</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">which relates to the period before you joined the department. The land was acquired from the local Panchayat at a nominal cost and the papers show that clearance certificates are available from the two of the three authorities who have to certify the site’s suitability. There is no certification by the architect available on file. You decide to visit Rampur to ensure that all is in order as stated on file. When you visit Rampur, you find that the plot under reference is part of Thakurgarh Fort and that the walls, ramparts, etc., are running across it. The fort is well away from the main village, therefore a school here will be a serious inconvenience for the children. However, the area near the village has potential to expand into a larger residential area. The development charges on the existing plot, at the fort, will be very high</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">and the question of heritage site has not been addressed.

They are of the view that the girls should be quickly married off with minimum education. The girls are also competing for jobs after education, which have traditionally remained in boys’ exclusive domain, adding to unemployment amongst male population.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">The younger generation feels that in the present era, girls should have equal opportunities for education and employment, and other means of livelihood. The entire locality is divided between the elders and the younger lot and further sub-divided between sexes in both generations. You come to know that in Panchayat or in other local bodies or even in busy crossroads, the issue is being acrimoniously debated.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">One day you are informed that an unpleasant incident has taken place.

Now-a-days, there is an increasing thrust on economic development all around the globe. At the same time, there is also an increasing concern about environmental degradation caused by development. Many a time, we face a direct conflict between developmental activity and environmental quality. It is neither feasible to stop or curtail the developmental process, nor it is advisable to keep degrading the environment, as it threatens our very survival.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Discuss some feasible strategies which could be adopted to eliminate this conflict and which could lead to sustainable development.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">26. Suppose one of your close friends, who is also aspiring for civil services, comes to you for discussing some of the issues related to ethical conduct in public service. He raises the following points:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: left;">1. In the present times, when unethical environment is quite prevalent, individual attempts to stick to ethical principles may cause a lot of problems in one&#39;s career. It may also cause hardship to the family members as well as risk to one&#39;s life. Why should we not be pragmatic and follow the path of least resistance, and be happy with doing whatever good we can?</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: justify;">2. When so many people are adopting wrong means and are grossly harming the system, what difference would it make if only a small minority tries to be ethical? They are going to be rather ineffective and are bound to get frustrated.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: left;">3. If we become fussy about ethical considerations, will it not hamper the economic progress of our country? After all, in the present age of high competition, we cannot afford to be left behind in the race of development.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: left;">4. It is understandable that we should not get involved in grossly unethical practices, but giving and accepting small gratifications and doing small favours increases everybody&#39;s motivation. It also makes the system more efficient. What is wrong in adopting such practices?</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Critically analyze the above viewpoints. On the basis of this analysis, what will be your advice to your friend?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">27. You are a no-nonsense, honest officer. You have been transferred to a remote district to head a department that is notorious for its inefficiency and callousness. You find that the main cause of the poor state of affairs is the indiscipline of a section of employees. They do not work themselves and also disrupt the working of others. You first warned the troublemakers to mend their ways or else face disciplinary action. When the warning had</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">little effect, you issued a show cause notice to the ringleaders. As a retaliatory measure, these troublemakers instigated a woman employee amongst them to file a complaint of sexual harassment against you with the Women&#39;s Commission. The Commission promptly seeks your explanation. The matter is also publicized in the&#39; media to embarrass you further. Some of the options to handle this situation could be as follows:</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Give your explanation to the Commission and go soft on the disciplinary action.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.

(i) Suppose you are the CEO of a company that manufactures specialized electronic equipment used by a government department. You have submitted your bid for the supply of this equipment to the department. Both the quality and cost of your offer are better than those of the competitors. Yet the concerned officer is demanding a hefty bribe for approving the tender. Getting the order is important both for you and for your company. Not getting the order would mean closing a production line. It may ay also affect your own career. However, as a value-conscious person, you do not want to give bribe.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(ii) Valid arguments can be advanced both for giving the bribe and getting the order, and for refusing to pay the bribe and risking the loss of the order.

Some candidates were provided external help in the examination. Rameshwar brought these incidents to the notice of his seniors.

Rectification of these</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">lacunae at this stage would require a substantial amount of demolition and rework which will cause a tangible loss to the contractor and will also delay completion.

He advised for further expediting the project for completion in time. However, you are convinced that this was a serious matter which might affect public safety and should not be left unaddressed. What will you do in such a situation?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Some of the options are given below. Evaluate the merits and demerits of each of these options and finally suggest what course of action you would like to take, giving reasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Follow the advice of the Chief Engineer and go ahead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Make exhaustive report of the situation bringing out all facts and analysis along with your own viewpoints stated clearly and seek for written orders from the Chief Engineer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Call for explanation from the Junior Engineers and issue orders to the contractor for necessary correction within targeted time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Highlight the issue so that it reaches superiors above the Chief Engineer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Considering the rigid attitude of the Chief Engineer, seek transfer from the project or report sick.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">33. So far as child labor norms for hazardous industries like firecrackers industry are concerned, International Labour Organization (ILO) has set the minimum age as 18 years. In India, however, this age is 14 years. The units in industrial clusters of firecrackers can be classified into registered and non-registered entities. One typical unit is household based</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;">work</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Though the law is clear on the use of child labour employment norms in registered/ non- registered units, it does not include household based works. Household based work means children working under the supervision of their parents/relative. To evade child labor norms,</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">several units project themselves as household-based works but employ children from outside.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Needless to say that employing children saves the costs for these units leading to higher profits to the owner. On your visit to one of the units at Sivakasi, the owner takes you around the unit which has about 10-15 children below 14 years of age. The owner tells you that in his household-based unit, the children are all his relatives. You notice that several children smirk, when the owner tells you this. On deeper enquiry, you figure out that neither the owner nor the children are able to satisfactorily establish their relationship with each other.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) bring out and discuss the ethical issues involved in the above case.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(b) What would be your reaction after your above visit?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">34.

The PS also informs you that he is aware of the long pending and urgent proposal of our institute for grant of funds for modernization, which are awaiting the functionary’s approval. He assures you that he would get these proposals cleared.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) What are the options available to you?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(b) Evaluate each of these options and choose the option which you would adopt, giving reasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">35. As a senior officer in the Finance Ministry, you have access to some confidential and crucial information about policy decisions that the Government is about to announce.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These decisions are likely to have farreaching impact on the housing and construction</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">industry. If the builders have access to this information beforehand, they can make huge profits. One of the builders has done a lot of quality work for the Government and is known to be close to your immediate superior, who asks you to disclose this information to the said builder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(a) What are the options available to you?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(b) Evaluate each of these options and choose the options which you would adopt, giving reasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">36.
