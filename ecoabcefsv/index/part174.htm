However, the fears of recession haunted both the US and Europe</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">. More than the contraction of output , a greater concern was the increasing pace of the unemployment.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India had a higher degree of financial integration than trade integration with capital inflows both in current as well as capital account more than 100 per cent of the GDP. Let us also accept a fact that US is too large an economy to be ignored for their adverse fallouts by any</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">economy . Being the biggest economy is the biggest driver of integration and coupling of economies.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The crisis did impact India as well as other Asian economies such as China with a ‘slowdown’ in their growth but not contraction of output, in all these economies. The impact was there but less intense than that experienced by the US and European economies. As said previously, this was a financial sector crisis and the Indian financial system was less affected, given dominance of the public sector banks, which are less exposed to complex risk products, nor overleveraged, fairly risk averse and not much exposure to international markets and products.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What the crisis did to India was to push the domestic financial sector into a ‘cautious and wait and watch mode’, became averse to lending. It did impact some of the private and foreign banks in India but not to the same magnitude; as such exposures were limited and small in relation to their balance sheet size. This forced tightening of the liquidity by banks, self-imposed, in their own wisdom, dried up money with the industrial sector which in any case, had also gone in the cautious mode.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Both these resulted in build-up of inventories, longer production and repayment cycles and slowdown of industrial and overall growth of the Indian economy. It can be said the banking sector was on the verge of witnessing defaults and build-up of bad loan book, both which could have compounded the problem manifold and impact far greater.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The financial sector was fortunate to have a limited impact in the sense that no bank</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">or any financial institution collapsed. However, it did dent exports, as for the first time, in over a decade or so, there was contraction of exports. But this contraction was not sufficient, to contract overall output, given the relative low share of exports to total output of the Indian economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">So overall, the impact on India was that it put in the minds of people ‘fear and</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">uncertainty’, resulting in a slowdown and definitely impacting exports for a short period of six months. The impact and fallout could have been greater and deeper both for the world economy and India, but for ‘timely’ and ‘collective’ government interventions both in India as well as other major economies of US, EU and Japan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part173.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part175.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
