Any investment decision in a particular offering of an individual or an institution is purely their own wisdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Once the process of issuance is complete, company received the money, refunds completed, it has to get their shares/bonds listed at any of the stock exchanges which will allow for trading or sale purchase of shares of the company at the stock exchanges.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This is known as secondary market operations where shares are traded i.e., bought and sold at prices decided by the sellers and buyers of shares of a particular company. The two most important stock exchanges of the country are the Bombay stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Even though there is a larger trading at the NSE, BSE is said to be the nerve centre of the Indian capital market, one being the oldest and the later located in the financial capital of the country; As it is difficult to track down trading of all the listed companies, an index</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">is used to comment on the general-trading trend of a particular day. This index is known as SENSEX at BSE which is an index of trading of top thirty companies in terms of their volume of trade and their share prices.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Similarly, NIFTY is the index of the NSE which has fifty companies. There is also NIFTY JUNIOR which is next fifty companies in terms of volume of trade and those which have the potential to become a part of NIFTY in future.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Further trading at the stock exchanges have been made simple and easy with computerization and issuance of shares and their trading is performed in the electronic form (dematerializing which is conversion into electronic form of all physical shares). Even with the capital reforms, greater transparency in allotment of shares and also trading of shares, there is a great degree of ignorance about the capital market and thus a little participation of the  public,  confined  to  a select middle class, and  finance is understood more as banking.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The preferred modes of investment continue to be the traditional areas of gold, land and bank deposits for the masses in India. It may still take some time for capital markets becoming alternates to the traditional forms of investment in India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part104.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part106.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
