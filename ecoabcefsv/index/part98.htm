Raghuram Rajan, the ex Governor of RBI</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">has identified the NPA problem as a major challenge facing the Indian Banking Sector . The problem which was largely hidden earlier as Banks used to do window dressing of their account statement has now come to the forefront after Rajan exhorted the banks to clean up their asset books by March 2017 . Resultantly this led to 29 public sector banks writing off Rs 1.14 Lakh Crore of bad debts between 2013 -2015 , much more than what they had done in the preceding 9 years.</p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">• <span class="p">The gross bad loans of 39 listed Indian banks , in absolute term, rose 92% in fiscal year</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">2016 to Rs.5.79 trillion even as after provisioning , the net bad loans more than doubled to Rs.3.38 trillion.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">• In percentage terms, the average gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of this group of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">banks rose from 4.41% of loans in 2015 to 7.91% in 2016; net NPAs in the past one year rose from 2.45% to 4.63%.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Public sector banks, which have close to 70% market share of loans, are more affected than their private sector peers.

This means that the Act was framed to address the problem of NPAs (Non-Performing Assets) or bad assets through different processes and mechanisms.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The SARFAESI Act gives detailed provisions for the formation and activities of Asset Securitization Companies (SCs)and Reconstruction Companies (RCs). Scope of their activities, capital requirements, funding etc. are given by the Act. RBI is the regulator for these institutions.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As <span class="p">legal mechanism to insulate assets, the Act addresses the interests of secured</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">creditors (like banks). Several provisions of the Act give directives and powers to various institutions to manage the bad asset problem. Following are the main objectives of the SARFAESI Act.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The Act provides the legal framework for securitization activities in India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• It gives the procedures for the transfer of NPAs to asset reconstruction companies for the reconstruction of the assets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• The Act enforces the security interest without Court’s intervention</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: left;">• The Act give powers to banks and financial institutions to take over the immovable property that is hypothecated or charged to enforce the recovery of debt.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has amended its Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process Regulations to ensure that as part of due diligence, prior to approval of a Resolution Plan, the antecedents, credit worthiness and credibility of a Resolution Applicant, including promoters, arc taken into account by the Committee of Creditors.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India was set up on 1st October 2016 under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code).

In the past few years, because of a variety of legacy issues including the delay caused in various approvals as well as land acquisition etc., and also because of low global and domestic demand, many large projects have stalled. Public Sector Banks which have got predominant share of infrastructure financing have been sorely affected. It has resulted in lower profitability for PSBs, mainly due to provisioning for the restructured projects as well as for gross NPAs. Indradhanush Plan for revamping Public Sector Banks (PSBs), announced by the Government  on 14.8.2015, envisaged  capital  infusion  by the Government of Rs. 70,000 crore. Under Indradhanush, Government infused capital of Rs. 51,858crorc, till the first half of the financial year (FY) 2017-18.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The 7 elements includes:</p><p class="s70" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">1. <span class="p">Appointments</span></p><p class="s70" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">2. <span class="p">Bank Board Bureau</span></p><p class="s70" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">3. <span class="p">Capitalizatio</span></p><p class="s70" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">4. <span class="p">De-Stressing Public Sector Banks</span></p><p class="s83" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">5. <span class="p">Empowerment</span></p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">6. <span class="p">Framework of accountability</span></p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7. <span class="p">Governance Reforms</span></p><p class="s84" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -12pt;    text-align: justify;">1. <span class="s7">Appointment: </span><span class="p">The Government decided to separate the post of Chairman and Managing Director by prescribing that in the subsequent vacancies to be filled up the CEO will get the designation of MD &amp; CEO and there would be another person who would be appointed as non-Executivc Chairman of PSBs. This approach is based on global best practices and as per the  guidelines in the Companies Act to ensure appropriate  checks  and balances.  The selection process for  both these positions  has been transparent and meritocratic. The entire process of selection for MD &amp; CEO was revamped. Private sector candidates were also allowed to apply for the position of MD &amp; CEO of the five top banks i.e. Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Canara Bank.</span></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">2. <span class="s7">Bank Board Bureau: </span><span class="p">The BBB will be a body of eminent professionals and officials,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">which will replace the Appointments Board for appointment of <b>Whole-time Directors as well as non-Executive Chairman of PSBs. </b>They will also constantly engage with the Board of Directors of all the PSBs to formulate appropriate strategies for their growth and development.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The structure of the BBB is going to be as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• The BBB will comprise of a Chairman and six more members of whom three will be officials and three experts (of which two would necessarily be from the banking sector).</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• The Search Committee for members of the BBB would comprise of the Governor, RBI and Secretary (FS) and Secretary (DoPT) as members.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• The BBB would broadly follow the selection methodology as approved in relevant ACC guidelines.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Bank Board Bureau will start functioning from the next financial year and is the first step toward a full-fledged bank holding company, an entity that will house the governments stake in state run banks struggling with mounting non ­</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">performing loans that have touched 6 per cent of gross advances.</p><p class="s85" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -11pt;    text-align: justify;">3. <span class="s7">Capitalization: </span><span class="p">The government will inject a total of Rs 25,000 crore of capital into debt-laden state banks in this fiscal; Rs 20,000 crore would be injected in a month.

A clearer distinction</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">between interference and intervention has been made. With autonomy comes accountability, accordingly Banks have been asked to build robust Grievances Redressal Mechanism for customers as well as staff so that concerns of the affected are addressed effectively in time bound manner. The government will strive to make it easier for PSBs to hire. Hie government is looking at introducing Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOPs) for the PSU bank managements.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">6. Framework of Accountability: <span class="p">The government also announced a new framework of key performance indicators for state-run lenders to boost efficiency in functioning while assuring them of independence in decision making on purely commercial considerations, (a) The present system for the measurement of bank’s performance was a system </span>called Sol —Statement of Intent. <span class="p">Based on certain criteria decided by Ministry of Finance, the banks used to come up with their annual target figures which was discussed between the Ministry and banks and finalized. The entire exercise took very long and sometimes the targets for banks used to be finalized only towards the end of the year which is not a desirable thing to do.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">7. Governance Reforms: <span class="p">The process of governance reforms started with </span>“Gyan Sangam” - <span class="p">a conclave of PSBs and FIs organized at the beginning of 2015 in Pune which was attended by all stake-holders including Prime Minister, Finance Minister, MoS (Finance), Governor, RBI and CMDs of all PSBs and FIs. There was focus group discussion on six different topics which resulted in specific decisions on optimizing capital, digitizing processes, strengthening risk management, improving managerial performance and financial inclusion. Continuing with this year’s Gyan Sangam, next Gyan Sangam will be held between 14-16.01.2016 to discuss strategy with top level officials.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Indradhanush framework for transforming the PSBs represents the most comprehensive reform effort undertaken since banking nationalisation in the year 1970. Our PSBs are now ready to compete and flourish in a fast-evolving financial services landscape.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARA</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s88" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Economic Survey 2016-17 suggests settingup of a centralised Public Sector Asset Rehabilition Agency The Agency will look after the largest, most difficult Cases, and make Politically Tough Decisions to reduce Debt.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Economic Survey shows that our country has been trying to solve its <span class="s88">&#39;Twin Balance </span>SZwf(TBS) problem - overleveraged companies and bad-loan-encumbered banks, a legacy of the boom years around the Global Financial Crisis. So far, there has been limited success. The problem has consequently continued to fester: Non­ Performing Assets (NPAs) of the banking system (and especially public sector banks) keep  increasing,  while  credit and  investment keep falling.  Now  it is time to consider a different approach - a centralised Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA) that could take charge of the largest, most difficult cases, and make politically tough decisions to reduce debt.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 9pt;    text-align: justify;">As per the Survey , gross NPAs has climbed to almost 12 per cent of gross advances for ublic sector banks at end-September 2016. At this level, India’s NPA ratio is higher than any ther major emerging market, with the exception of Russia. The consequent squeeze of banks as led them to slow credit growth to crucial sectors -especially to industry and medium and mall scale enterprises (MSMEs )-to levels unseen over the past two decades . As this has ccurred, growth in private and overall investment has turned negative. A decisive resolution is rgently needed before the TBS problem becomes a serious drag on growth.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part97.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part99.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
