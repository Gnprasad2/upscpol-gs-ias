It needs to be clarified first that it is not the clipping of wings but only a larger role for private sector. Neither is the status being diluted given the huge investments and asset base of the public sector in the country. The policy should not be seen as undermining the importance of public sector, but role of public sector would undergo a change as mentioned below:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) From a welfare orientation they would shift to function as a commercial venture with profits as an objective to the extent feasible as a public sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2) From production-oriented they would become productivity-oriented.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">3) They will operate with greater professionalism and well run public sector would operate with greater operational and functional autonomy to the extent feasible.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) Many more public sector would acquire the status of ‘Mini-navrattan, Navrattan and Maharatnas’, yielding them a greater degree of freedom for taking investment decisions by the respective boards of public sector and not requiring government approval.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">4) There would be consolidation and likelihood of mergers amongst public sector such as oil companies, nationalized banks to enable them to achieve greater economies of scale and help them to compete with global companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">5) Many public sectors may opt for overseas acquisitions paving the way for public sector to become global players.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">6) There is a likelihood of public sector getting into joint ventures with private sector and greater joint participation in key areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The chief executive officer of public sector would be considered for appointment based on merit and competence both within as well as outside the government.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(8) There would be a level playing field with the private sector allowing for healthy competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(9) Gradually, their monopoly status would get diluted with entry of private and foreign companies and they would not be at commanding heights’ of the economy but operate along with private and foreign companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(10) Efforts would be made to address the loss making public sector by exploring all avenues for their revival through capital infusion, waiving off accumulated losses so that they can start afresh on a clean slate. However, all such revivals of the loss making public sector may come with a ‘rider’, that this revival would be subject to privatization subsequently.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(11) However, the biggest challenge before the profitable public sector would be their ability to be competitive, productive and efficient and remain profitable in future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part51.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part53.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
