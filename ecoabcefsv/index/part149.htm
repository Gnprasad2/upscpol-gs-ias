Gradually, the emphasis was shifted to development oriented for developing countries and addressing issues of growing poverty&#39; and poor countries in Asia and Africa. The WB provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries through multiple sister institutions playing a complementary role, for eradication of poverty, education, public health, public administration, agriculture, addressing environmental issues and funding projects which have predominant socio-welfare considerations covering schools, hospitals, dams, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">These projects are not World Bank-driven but are of the governments with World Bank only providing financial assistance to them and thus does not come with conditionalities except that the projects for which assistance has been provided is completed on schedule. Their funding not only covers central but also state governments, NGOs and other such</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">institutions , domestic as well as overseas , engaged in development -related work in the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">country. The financial assistance, unlike the IMF, is not commercial borrowing, but concessional</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">, repayable over long time periods.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As mentioned previously, World Bank comprises of complementary institutions of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) the International Development Agency (IDA), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agreement (MIGA) and International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The IBRD is more focused on reducing poverty in middle income credit worthy relatively poor countries through income generation activities and capacity building measures.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The IDA looks at the poorest seventy-nine economies including thirty-five countries of Africa, with per capita gross national income of less than USD 1165. Assistance provided is for infrastructure, public health and social sectors. Assistance provided is interest-free and have repayment periods of 35-40 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">IFC provides technical and financial assistance to medium and small enterprises in developing countries and also to promote entrepreneurship especially in developing countries. MIGA provides guarantees of political risks’ to overseas investments, while ICSID resolves investment disputes of member countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The major role of the WB has been centred around eradication of absolute poverty in African and Asian countries and also making poverty a global issue and not restricted to one or group of countries. It has also given its own definition of poverty of those living below USD 1 per day.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Besides, it also prepares country level papers on developing countries outlining developmental requirements of developing countries and eradication of poverty in a sustained manner. It also provides insights to economies for inclusive and sustainable growth by providing assistance to the governments and communities.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Hie WB has already committed USD 14 billion assistance to India during 2009-2012. Recently RBI would subscribe to special private placement of bonds issued by WB to the extent of USD 4.3 billion, which will make India eligible for higher concessional borrowings from WB. It will also provide a stable and long-term source for meeting current account deficit. The WB has set up the catastrophe risk deferred draw down option (CRDD) with a corpus of USD 500 million for providing assistance to middle income economies affected by natural disasters.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Playing its role post-global crisis, it has established vulnerability financing facility (VFF) within the IDA, to provide fast track financial assistance and also a rapid social response fund (RSRF) for meeting emergent social needs of low income economies . The ‘group’ is also</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">committed to fund stabilizing of existing infrastructure and ensure delivery of priority projects</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">amongst developing member countries. The ‘bank’ also undertakes continuous review of public expenditure and debt management for economies useful for policy -makers of the respective economies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part148.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part150.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
