There is a need for greater ‘financial inclusion’ that is, to provide banking</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">products and services to the masses especially die poor, technology enabled, at affordable prices. It is believed that this is the reason why India needs public sector banks. The contention may be true if financial inclusion is envisioned  as a socio -welfare measure , similar to the prevailing concept of priority sector lending, at a concessional rate in India for the neglected sections and agriculture . Such kind of directed lending has been there since banks were nationalized with the objective of converting ‘class’ into ‘mass’ banking.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Access to safe , easy and affordable credit and other financial services by the poor and vulnerable groups, disadvantaged areas and lagging sectors is recognized as a pre­ condition for accelerating growth and reducing income disparities and poverty . In view of this , Financial Inclusion has been identified as a key dimension of the overall strategy of “Towards Faster and More Inclusive Growth&quot; envisaged in the eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Financial inclusion is generally defined in terms of exclusion from the financial system. A target group is considered as financially excluded if they do not have access to mainstream formal financial services such as banking accounts, credit cards, insurance, payment services, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Government of India had constituted a committee in 2006 under the chairmanship of Dr. C. Rangarajan to study the pattern of exclusion from access to financial services across region, gender and occupational structure and to identify the barriers confronted by vulnerable</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">groups in accessing credit and financial services and recommend the steps needed for financial</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">inclusion . The committee submitted its report in January 2008 . The committee has given a working definition of financial inclusion as;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">“Financial inclusion may be defined as the process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low income groups at an affordable cost.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Clearly, directed lending is seen more as a compulsion as have to be performed, rather than willingly lending to them. Seeing financial inclusion as a socio-welfare measure will ensure that it will never happen. It has to be seen as a commercial and viable business. The opportunity cost to the poor for raising money from money lenders is very high. They can become an important profitable venture for banks. Any private bank will be driven by the profitability angle, be it the rich or the poor segment.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The biggest issue is the ability to reach out to them through an organized finance route, besides the money lenders. The proliferation of MFIs in the private sector is an example of how the profit motive can drive reaching them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, this will require innovativeness as it may not be feasible nor practical or cost effective to open bank branches in all the villages. Various models can be considered and the private sector will find a way to reach them in a cost-effective manner, better than the public sector banks.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Today, technology has penetrated virtually every segment every walk of life then why not the poor people. Not long ago mobile phones were for the affluent and how now they have penetrated all classes of the people . This is the ingenuity of businesses , of tapping</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">opportunities wherever available, and making them profitable.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Financial inclusion is achieved when all individuals and businesses have access to and can effectively use a broad range of financial services that are provided responsibly, and at reasonable cost, by sustainable institutions in a well-regulated environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The essence of financial inclusion is in trying to ensure that a range of appropriate financial services is available to every individual and enabling them to understand and access those services.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In order to achieve a comprehensive financial inclusion, a slew of initiatives have been taken by Government of India, RBI and NABARD. Some of the important initiatives include; SHG-Bank Linkage programme, opening of No Frills Accounts, mobile banking, Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Financial inclusion can happen, but with technology and seeing it as a business proposition rather than as a welfare measure. It is the biggest imperative today of linking the poor to banks as it can serve multiple objectives of first, access to organized source of finance for the poor, second getting them outside the clutches of the money lenders, third allowing the government to provide them with income support rather than subsidies and most importantly getting rid of all the middlemen. It is also seen as an integral aspect of inclusive growth of India in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Benefits of Financial Inclusion</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Financial inclusion enables good financial decision making through financial literacy and qualified advice as also access to financial services for all, particularly the vulnerable</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">groups such as weaker sections, minorities, migrants, elderly, micro entrepreneurs and low income groups at an affordable cost so as to enable them to:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• Manage their finances on day to day basis confidently, effectively and securely;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Plan for the future to protect themselves against short term variations in income and expenditure and for wealth creation and gaining from financial sector developments; and</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Deal with financial distress effectively thereby reducing their vulnerability to the unexpected.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) visualises financial services for poor and low-income people and micro and small enterprises as an important and integral component of the financial sector, each with its own comparative advantages, and each presenting the market with a business opportunity.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite the marked progress made in the direction of financial inclusion, the problem of exclusion still persist. For achieving the current policy stance of “inclusive growth” the focus on financial inclusion is not only essential but a  pre-requisite. And for  achieving comprehensive financial inclusion, the first step is to achieve credit inclusion for the disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of our society.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s73" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">15.10 <span class="s18">SMALL FINANCE BANK</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Small Finance Bank (SFB) is a private financial institution intended to further the objective of financial inclusion by primarily undertaking basic banking activities of acceptance of deposits and lending to unserved sections including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and unorganised sector entities, but without any restriction in the area of operations, unlike Regional Rural Banks or Local Area Banks.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Small Finance Banks were created pursuant to the announcement in Union Budget 2014-2015, presented on July 10, 2014. RBI issued the guidelines on 27<span class="s19">th </span>November 2014 for licensing and regulation of SFBs. On 16<span class="s19">th </span>September 2015, RBI decided to grant “in-principle” approval to 10 applicants to set up small finance banks to further push the agenda of financial inclusion.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The 10 entities that received the nod for small banks include, Au Financiers (Jaipur), Capital Local Area Bank (Jalandhar), Disha Microfin (Ahmedabad), Equitas Holdings (Chennai), ESAF Microfinance and Investments (Chennai), Janalakshmi Financial Services (Bengaluru), RGVN (Northeast) Microfinance (Guwahati), Suryoday Micro Finance (Navi Mumbai), Ujjivan Financial Services (Bengaluru) and Utkarsh Micro Finance (Varanasi).</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The aforementioned banks were selected from a list of 72 applicants. Small finance</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">banks will be allowed to take deposits from customers. And as against payments banks, small finance banks will also be allowed to lend money to people.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Most of the entities that have received the ‘in-principle’ nod include micro-finance institutions. Which means, most customers of small finance banks will account for small and medium enterprises and small businesses. These banks will now be able to provide</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">secured and legal loans to MSMEs and SMEs, bringing them under the ambit of the financial system.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Small finance banks is another step to bring the unbanked under the ambit of the banking system. Small finance banks will provide banking products to the unserved and undeserved sections of the country, which includes small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries, and other organized sector entities, at an affordable cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">RBI has created a framework for licencing small banks and other differentiated banks. Differentiated banks serving niche interests, local area banks, payment banks etc. are contemplated to meet credit and remittance needs of small businesses, unorganized sector, low income households, farmers and migrant work force.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s73" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15.11 <span class="s18">PAYMENTS BANKS</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">A payment bank is a differentiated bank that will undertake only certain restricted banking functions that the Banking Regualtion Act of 1949 allows. These activities include acceptance of deposits, payments and remittance services, internet banking and function as busines correspondant of other banks. Initially, they are allowed to collect deposits up to Rs 1 lakh per individual.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">They can facilitate money transfers and sell insurance and mutual funds. Besides, they can issue ATM/debit cards, but not credit cards. They cannot set up subsidiaries to undertake non-banking financial services activities. More importantly, they are not allowed to undertake lending activities at all.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">RBI released the list of entities which had applied for a payments bank licence on February 2015. There were 41 applicants. An External Advisory Committee (EAC) headed by Nachiket Mor is constituted to evaluate the licence applications. The government decided that India Post will use its large network to run payments bank. The external advisory committee headed by Nachiket Mor submitted its findings on 6<span class="s19">th </span>July 2015. The applicant entities were examined for their financial track record and governance issues. The objective of payment banks will bring unbanked masses under the ambit of formal banking and also expedite financial inclusion. The spread of banking will also make the poor financially literate and help fight poverty. The establishment of payment banks is a significant and important step from the RBI. Payments banks will reach out to people in rural areas. Payments bank will ensure more money comes into banking system. Various banks are looking at increasing their rural reach, including big banks like SBI, payments banks will help them realise this objective.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Reserve Bank of India gave “in-principle” licences to the following entities to launch payments banks:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Aditya Birla Nuvo</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Airtel M Commerce Services</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Cholamandalam Distribution Services</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Department of Posts</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• FINO PayTech</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• National Securities Depository</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Reliance Industries</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Dilip Shanghvi, Sun Pharmaceuticals</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Vijay Shekhar Sharma , Paytm</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Tech Mahindra</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Vodafone M-Pesa</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Out of these, three have surrendered their licenses. First one being “Chalomandalam Distribution Services”, then “Dilip Shanghvi, Sun Pharmaceuticals” and the latest, “Tech Mahindra”. The “in-principle” license is valid for 18 months within which the entities must fulfill the requirements. They are not allowed to engage in banking activities within the period. The RBI will consider grant full licenses under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 , after it is satisfied that the conditions have been fulfilled.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Payments Bank are proposed to be registered as a public limited company under the Companies Act, 2013, and licensed under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, with specific licensing conditions restricting its activities to acceptance of demand deposits and provision of payments and remittance services. It will be governed by the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, other relevant Statutes and Directives, Prudential Regulations and other Guidclines/Instructions issued by RBI and other regulators from time to rime, including the regulations of the securities market regulator, SEBI, regarding public issues and other guidelines applicable to listed banking companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">With differentiated banks entering the banking space, the biggies like SBI, ICICI Bank etc. feel the jitters.These banks will function only in specific areas. The major banks can actually make use of these banks to spread their reach as payment banks are allowed to function as business correspondents too. Some of them have already tied up with existing licence holders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">D-SIBs</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Recently RBI listed HDFC as Domestic - Systematically Important Bank (DSIB) under the bucket structure identified last year.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Domestic- Systematically Important Banks (DSIBs):</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: left;">• DSIBs are also referred to as <b>“Too Big To Fail” (TBTF) </b>because of their size, cross- jurisdictional activities, complexity and lack of substitute and interconnection.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: left;">• Banks whose assets cross <i><b>2% </b></i><b>of the GDP </b>are considered DSIBs.

The main objectives of the schemes are to reduce the demand for physical gold and shift a part of the gold imported every year for investment purposes into financial savings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sovereign Gold Bonds</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">These are issued by RBI on behalf of the Government of India in rupees and denominated in grams of gold and restricted for sale to the resident Indian entities only both in demat and paper form. The minimum and maximum investment limits are two grams and 500 grams of gold per person per fiscal year respectively. The rate of interest for the year 2015- 16 is 2.75 per cent per annum, payable on a half yearly basis. The tenor of the Bond is for a period of 8 years with exit option from 5th year onwards. KYC norms are the same as that for gold. Exemption from capital gains tax is also available. Redemption is made in the rupee value equivalent to the price of gold at the time of maturity.

The key objectives of this scheme are stated as under:</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• To mobilize the gold held by households and institutions in the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• To provide a fillip to the gems and jewellery sector in the country by making gold available as raw material on loan from the banks.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">• To be able to reduce reliance on import of gold over time to meet the domestic demand. The gold mobilization scheme is likely to work according to the draft guidelines:</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">1. The scheme is meant to mobilize gold held by domestic households and institutions.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Gold collected through the scheme will be made available to jewellers for manufacturing of new jewellery and other items.</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">2. <span class="p">The scheme will initially be launched at a few places because the government will have</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to first set-up infrastructure for facilitating easy and secure handling of gold.</p><p class="s82" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">3<span class="s50">. </span><span class="p">Gold collected from consumers will first be cleaned and measured at test centres; it would then be melted to test for purity.

The minimum quantity of gold that a customer can bring is proposed to be set at 30 grams.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">5. Those willing to deposit the gold will be given a certificate mentioning the amount and purity of the deposited gold.

For example: if a customer deposits 100 gms of gold and gets 1 per cent interest, then, on maturity he has a credit of 101 gms.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The customer will have the option of redemption either in cash or in gold, which will have to be exercised in the beginning itself (that is, at the time of making the deposit). The tenure of the deposit will be minimum 1 year and in multiples of one year. Like a fixed deposit ,</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">breaking of locking period will be allowed.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 3pt;    text-align: justify;">Gold savings account will be exempt from capital gains tax, wealth tax and income tax. According co che government, gold deposit accounts will utilise the 20,000 tonnes</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">available within the country and help in cutting down the 800-1,000 tonnes of gold the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">country ships every year. Among the regulatory issues for banks, it said some certainty on use the gold deposits as part of their Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity’ Ratio (SLR) requirements would be helpful. Irrespective of the difficulties, it underscored that the scheme holds great benefits on the macro front, saying, it can lower gold imports by bringing into circulation domestically-held idle gold, thus, helping the external balances. Additionally, the easy availability of the precious metal can reduce costs for jewellers and increase the exports. Seeking to mobilise idle gold worth up to Rs 60 lakh crore held by households and institutions, the government proposed a new scheme offering tax-free interest on depositing the yellow metal with banks. The draft of gold monetisation scheme also provides for incentives to the banks. Individuals and institutions can deposit as low as 30 gms of gold, while the interest earned on it would be exempt from income tax as well as capital gains tax.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The government can partly address the problem to a certain extent by making invoices mandatory only for gold brought in the form of bars or coins and not necessarily for household ornaments. The banks can track the transaction with sufficient proofs on address and identity. In case, the quantity exceeds a particular limit, even on ornaments, questions can be raised. Unless the government structures the GMS carefully, the fate of the scheme cannot be far different from that of its older version.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part96.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part98.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
