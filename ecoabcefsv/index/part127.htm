Already, the Indian market has a large number of low-priced Chinese goods.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) With easing of restrictions on inflows there could be a surge on foreign funds which could have  an adverse  impact  like appreciating  home currency and hurting  exports especially for a country like India (explained in the section on Exchange Rate later).</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) It could lead to increase conspicuous consumption or ‘consumerism’ leading India into a consumption-driven from investment-driven economy. This can lead to lopsided development neglecting the interests of the masses. Greater production of goods demanded and lesser production of those which are less-demanded. Any consumerism also leads to lower savings in the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) The biggest challenge of globalization would be in making the domestic sector globally competitive, ability co withstand global competition and make inroads into global markets.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) The other is about expectations from globalization. It is not’ to provide answers for larger issues of poverty, unemployment, reducing regional imbalances or other such issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">As mentioned previously, it is all about achieving integration with the rest of the world, global competitiveness as the key to globalization. Therein, lies the challenge of the ability of the government to change the misconception of globalization . The Economic</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Reforms of 1991 comprising of liberalization , privatization and globalization seeking to</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">achieve domestic and global competitiveness , increased share in global trade , efficient and competitive domestic manufacturing base, higher growth driven by manufacturing sector and exports.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The increased growth, would ‘over a period of time’, bring about overall development.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">And the government in  letting  economic reforms to deliver should  also be conscious of the fact that answers to the larger issues of poverty, unemployment, regional imbalances lie within ‘its’ domain.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">A criticism of the economic reforms of not delivering in these areas or not impacting social issues, is an acceptance, by the government, of not being able to clearly delineate deliverables from economic reforms from ‘deliverables falling within government’ own domain.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part126.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part128.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
