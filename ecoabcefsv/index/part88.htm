And if seen to be taken by an individual, these decisions can cause a lot of heartburn. Therefore, globally many governments have solved this problem by appointing a committee.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Government amended the RBI Act to hand over the job of monetary policy- making in India to a newly constituted Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on June 27, 2016.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The new MPC is to be a six-member panel that is expected to bring “value and transparency” to rate-setting decisions. It will feature three members from the RBI: the Governor, a Deputy Governor and another official and three independent members to be selected by the Government.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">A search committee (yes, another committee) will recommend three external members, experts in the field of economics, banking or finance, for the Government</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">appointees. The MPC will meet four times a year to decide on monetary policy by a majority vote. And if there’s a tie between the ‘Ayes’ and the ‘Nays’, the RBI governor gets the deciding vote.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Where the government nominees will serve a four-year term “or until further orders, whichever is earlier”, they will function as independent members. The committee decides interest rates through a majority vote, with each member having one vote. In case there is a tie, the governor will cast vote. At least four members will have to be present for the quorum to be complete. The special feature of MPC is that, it doesn’t comprise of only pure monetary economists.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Functions of the MPC</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Under the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement, the RBI will be responsible for containing inflation targets at 4% (with a standard deviation of 2%) in the medium term. Under Section 45ZA(1) of the RBI Act, 1934, the Central Government determines the inflation target in terms of the Consumer Price Index, once in every five years in consultation with the RBI. This target would be notified in the Official Gazette. Though the central bank already had a monetary framework and was implementing the monetary policy, the newly designed statutory framework would mean that the RBI would have to give an explanation in the form of a report to the Central Government, if it failed to reach the specified inflation targets. It shall, in the report, give reasons for failure, remedial actions as well as estimated time within which the inflation target shall be achieved. Further, RBI is mandated to publish a Monetary Policy Report every six months, explaining the sources of inflation and the forecasts of inflation for the coming period of six to eighteen months.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Given this backdrop,  MPC decides the changes to  be  made  to the policy rate (repo rate) so as to contain the inflation within the target level specified to it by the Central Government. Each  member of the Monetary  Policy  Committee has to write a statement specifying the reasons for voting in favour of, or against the proposed resolution, and the same alongwith the resolution adopted by the MPC is published as minutes of the meeting by RBI after 14 days of the said meeting. In addition, subsequent to the MPC meeting, RBI has to publish a document explaining the steps to be taken by it to implement the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee, including any changes thereto.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Decision Making at MPC</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The proceedings of MPC are confidential and the quorum for a meeting shall be four a members, at least one of whom shall be the Governor and in his absence, the Deputy who is the Member of the MPC.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The MPC takes decisions based on majority vote (by those who are present and voting). In case of a tie, the RBI governor will have the second or casting vote. The decision of the Committee would be binding on the RBI.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reason of—</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• any vacancy in, or any defect in the constitution of the MPC; or</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• any defect in the appointment of a person acting as a Member of the MPC; or</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• any irregularity in the procedure of the MPC not affecting the merits of the case.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As per the Act, RBI has to organise at least four meetings of the MPC in a year. The government may, if it considers necessary, convey its views, in writing, to the MPC from time to time.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">RBI is mandated to furnish necessary information to the MPC to facilitate their decision making and if any member of the MPC, at any time, requests the RBI for additional information, including any  data,  models or  analysis,  the same  have to be  provided,  not just to that member but to all members.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The transitioning from the current decision process to that of an MPC will impart diversity of views, specialised experience and independence of opinion in the monetary policy decisions which could help in improving the representativeness in the overall decision-making process.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part87.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part89.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
