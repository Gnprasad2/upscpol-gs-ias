Air travel previous?, meant for ‘elite’ has been brought closer to the ‘common man by making it affordable Travel today is faster, lesser time-consuming, comfortable and also affordable for the people. This has given boost to tourism and more importantly increased the ‘awareness’ of different economies.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) <span class="s9">Telecommunication Revolution: </span>Telecommunication has undergone a complete revolution in the last two decades, both in terms of global teledensity as well as reach. Technology-intensive telephony is cost-effective and provides cheaper mode of telecommunication. Audio telecommunication is now giving way to visual telecommunication allowing one to view and talk at the same time. Multi-location video conferencing is gaining popularity as it saves time of travel besides providing an alternate way of telecommunication simultaneously across multiple locations. However, the real revolution is mobile telephony which has completely redefined telecommunications globally.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) <span class="s9">Information Metamorphosis: </span>It is a metamorphosis of the form of information from physical gathering, books, literature, magazines, previously known as ‘information asymmetrical’ (less information) to that of now symmetrical information (complete information) through the internet powered by the ‘search engines&#39; (google, yahoo, etc.). What this has done is global information’ right on your computer cutting across countries, products, services and knowledge. This has not only increased awareness, speed of information gathering but also the knowledge base of people.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) <span class="s9">Media Transformation: </span>The media transformation has been a gradual shift away from the print media to electronic media with the advent of televisions. Satellite connectivity today allows one to watch global developments right in ones own drawing room.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) <span class="s9">Redefined Living Standards: </span>The living standards of people have also undergone a change from ‘hard living’ to ‘soft living’ facilitated by the  availability,  enlarged choice set with greater stress on convenience and comfort. Increased demands for televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, etc., is not only because of increased income levels but also because of their continuous falling prices making them affordable.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) The easy paced lifestyle has paved way to fast-paced lifestyle such as fast foods, convenient goods, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) <span class="s9">Cultural  Exchanges:  </span>Globalization has facilitated and still facilitating socio-cultural exchanges across the countries and communities. These exchanges of ideas have cross border influence now, than ever before.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">All the above factors have led td integration of the world economy from an economic perspective to what is known as a ‘global village’. Goods and services today are not confined to geographies but are available across the countries.  Countries of origin have lost relevance with emergence of global brands and global players.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is difficult to ascertain today that a good being purchased is of which country. For example, Sony, a Japanese company could be selling televisions in India which may have been manufactured in Korea or Taiwan. Today goods and services, and their availability not identifiable by geographical boundaries but are driven by markets.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The above facilitators have served as an accelerator to the transformation of an inward- looking (closed) economy to an outward-looking (open) economy which is known as</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the process of globalization. The first thing to understand is that globalization is not an objective but a process or a journey towards opening up of an economy by looking towards the rest of the world and to achieve integration in a rapidly transforming global village.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part123.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part125.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
