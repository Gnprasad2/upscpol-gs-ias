Countries such as China have a rank of 50 and Brazil 62. This implies that our infrastructure is viewed as grossly inadequate by global standards.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) Raising long-term resources would require reforms in banking, insurance and pension funds as that is where long-term resources are available.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Further, long-term resources for infrastructure can also come through foreign investment (like in case of China) and government would have to further liberalize its policies to attract foreign investment in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) The PPP model is appreciable but cannot substitute government spending given the huge  magnitude of resources required. It can at best play  a  supportive  role  in infrastructure development.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) India’s metro infrastructure of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are virtually collapsing despite efforts of the state government. Even the major urban centres are having severe infrastructural constraints, despite having the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) That is, to say the government cannot absolve itself of its responsibilities of infrastructure development.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The twin challenges are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">How would the government raise resources given the budgetary constraints? The compulsions  of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management  Act  (FRBMA) would not only allow it to raise expenditure to keep the deficit level under check. The government has a legacy of an inefficient spender in the economy with as many as three hundred</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">government projects delayed by over eight years with a cost over-run of ₹49,000 crores.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">How to make the government an efficient spender in the economy? There are myriads issues of land acquisition, inter-ministerial coordination and bureaucratic delays which is inbuilt in any government functioning.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other is that we have to learn from the Chinese experience in infrastructure de­ velopment. They have kept the scale of existing ideas, instructive and unconventional, something as unbelievable.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Globally, it was believed that trains running over 450 km per hour was technically and scientifically not possible. The Chinese have proved every one wrong. They have constructed</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">compounded with increased intensity as the growth levels begin to accelerate and also with the growing population exerting greater pressure on the infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The government can also consider of having a separate budget for infrastructure. The railway budget could constitute a part of this budget allowing for greater complementarity between various sectors of infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There is a need for a greater broad-based discussion on the imperatives of infrastructure in future as otherwise it will become a limiting factor for growth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part60.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part62.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
