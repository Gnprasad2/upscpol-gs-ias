Why is one currency exchanged differently with another? It is about the demand and supply of a currency arising out of relative differentials in income levels, share in world trade, differences in purchasing power and relative differences in cost of production, or it could be even the central bank of the home country deciding on the worth of foreign currency in the home country.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Exchange rates become important for economies pursuing open policies as it increases the intermingling of foreign currencies with home currency necessitating their conversion for use in the domestic economy or the other way around, which is conversion of domestic to foreign currency for example, in meeting import requirements or overseas investment.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As long as economies remain closed, there is little relevance for exchange rate as there is little interface with the rest of the world, as an inward looking economy with predominance of the home currency and relatively lesser need for foreign currency except for the need to cover essential imports.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Determination of Exchange Rates</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">It may be mentioned that in certain economies, there is no necessity to exchange foreign currencies as there is little role for the home currency and foreign currency circulates ‘parallel and predominantly’ for all transaction-related purposes. Such economies are also known as ‘dollarized economies’. They are relatively very small economies, dependent on the US and also referred as the backyard of US. Examples are such as Panama, El Salvador, Ecuador, etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">For other economies, exchange rate determination is either as pegged/fixed exchange rates or market-determined exchange rates. Pegged or fixed exchange rates are determined as a direct intervention of the central bank in deciding on the exchange rates. There are certain variants to such interventions like:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -2pt;    text-align: left;">(1) <span class="s9">Currency Board—</span>The central bank of a country pegs the home currency to a stronger currency on a 1:1 basis or on a different ratio, as pegged exchange rate.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">That is, home currency in circulation would depend on the available, inflow of foreign currency. This is also referred to as the currency board’ system, advocated for economies experiencing uncontrollable inflation of very high levels. It is believed to impose strict monetary discipline and takes away monetary independence. Common examples of currency board system are Argentina, Hong Kong, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) <span class="s9">Crawling/Pegged Exchange Rates—</span>This is similar to fixed exchange rate but with the central bank of that country having the flexibility of letting the exchange rate to float in a small band with a ceiling and a floor’. Examples are China, Russia, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Market-determined exchange rates are as follows:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1)</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Full Float—<span class="p">The exchange rate in such economies is market-determined by the forces of demand and supply of foreign currency in the home country with no role of the central bank in exchange rate determination. Most economies such as the US, EU arc</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">full float economies.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(2)</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">‘Managed’ Exchange Rate—<span class="p">This is of India where even though the exchange indirect intervention by the central bank,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 1pt;    text-align: left;">recent origin especially by countries like rate is market-determined, there is active</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to bring the exchange rate closer to its own</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">perception, but without actually directly fixed exchange rate system.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tinkering with the exchange rate</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">as under</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This is referred as ‘dirty floating’, which is interference of the central bank in free markets to influence exchange rates. However, in India, given its impact on the domestic economy, it is known as ‘managed’ market-determined exchange rate.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Which can be said to be the best way of determination of exchange rates? It is difficult to say as each economy has different sets of challenges, their own internal priorities and a lot also depends on how it affects the domestic economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, as economies pursue greater openness, larger role for capital inflows and outflows and in the long-term, they would be better off, in moving to a market-determined exchange rate which allows for testing of strength of the home currency in relation to a foreign currency and movement in exchange rates can be useful for policy-makers. Just as a thermometer for the foreign exchange market.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, more importantly, market-determined exchange rates are seen as a maturity of economics with strong macro-economic fundamentals, their relative ability to be globally competitive. Large size economies such as the US, EU, UK and Japan with the sizeable global trade can be said to have hard currencies first, in respect of the volumes of trade. Secondly, their exchange rates are market-determined and third, having ‘widest global acceptability’ for various kinds of transactions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Soft currency would be that of economies which have limited global trade, restrictions on their exchange rate determination and have lesser acceptability globally for  different kinds of transactions. The Indian Rupee and to some extent the Chinese Yuan can be said to be presently as soft currencies. Why are exchange rates important in open economies? The exchange rates have high sensitivity to influencing inflows and outflows, exports and</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">imports into and out of the country’. Besides, too much of volatility can be fundamentally destabilizing and have the potential to create crises in economies as witnessed in the past especially SE Asian economies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Exchange Rate and Convertibility</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Very often market-determined exchange rates and convertibility are first, ‘wrongly’ seen as interchangeable to mean the same thing and the second, both, again wrongly seen, as logical extension of each other. It needs to be understood that ‘exchange rate determination’ and ‘convertibility’ are two separate and distinct issues, not dependent on each other, not logical extension of each other and all permutations and combinations are</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s71" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1)</p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(2)</p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(3)</p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(4)</p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(5)</p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(6)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Full float and full convertibility, (US).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Pegged exchange rates and full convertibility, (Thailand). Pegged exchange rate and no convertibility, (China).</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Currency boards and full convertibility (Argentina).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Managed exchange rate and no convertibility or no CAC (as in India). Managed exchange rate and complete convertibility (Brazil).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">That is, to say that if an economy has full convertibility it does not necessarily imply that it will have to have market-determined exchange rate and vice versa as can be seen from above. However, both have a common denominator in terms of their</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">impact on both inflows as well as outflows. The role played both by the exchange rate as well as convertibility responsible for crisis in open economies will be discussed later.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part153.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part155.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
