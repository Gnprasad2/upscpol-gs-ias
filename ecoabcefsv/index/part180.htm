It became hazardous when a possible debt default threatened the European Union.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Since 2008, EU leaders have struggled to agree on a solution. During that time, the Greek economy shrank 25 percent thanks to spending cuts and tax increases demanded by creditors. Greece’s debt-to-GDP ratio grew to 179 percent.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The disagreement is a matter of which countries lose out more. Greece wants the EU to forgive some of the debt. Since February 2015, the various European authorities and private investors have loaned Greece $294.7 billion euros. Greece has only repaid 41.6 billion euros.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The crisis triggered the eurozone debt crisis and created fears of a global financial crisis. It threw into question the viability of the eurozone itself. It warned of what could happen to other heavily indebted EU members.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Greece Crisis Explained</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">In 2009, Greece announced its budget deficit would be 12.9 percent of its gross domestic product. That’s more than four times the EU’s 3 percent limit. Rating agencies Fitch, Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s lowered Greece’s credit ratings. That scared off investors. It also drove up the cost of future loans. Greece didn’t have a good chance of finding the funds to repay its debt.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The EU and the IMF provided 240 billion euros in emergency funds in return for austerity measures. The EU had no choice but to stand behind its member by funding a bailout. Otherwise, it would face the consequences of Greece either leaving the eurozone or defaulting.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Austerity measures required Greece to increase the VAT tax and the corporate tax rate. It must close tax loopholes and reduce evasion. It should reduce incentives for early retirement. It has to raise worker contributions to the pension system. A significant change is the privatization of many Greek businesses, including electricity transmission. That reduces the power of socialist parties and unions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">On January 15, 2018, the Greek parliament agreed on new austerity measures. It needs to qualify for the next round of bailout payments. On January 22, the eurozone finance ministers are expected to approve 6 billion to 7 billion euros. The new measures make it more difficult for unions to strike. The country is often paralyzed by strikes. It helps banks reduce bad debt, opens up the energy and pharmacy markets, and recalculates child benefits. The bailout program is scheduled to end in August, 2018. Greece’s unemployment rate has fallen to 20 percent from more than 25 percent in 2013. Its economy grew 2.5 percent, compared to an almost 10 percent contraction in 2011. It expects to repay at least 75 percent of its debt by 2060. Until then, European creditors will supervise adherence to austerity measures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part179.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part181.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
