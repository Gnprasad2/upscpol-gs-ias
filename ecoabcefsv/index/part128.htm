It has a diverse culture of unity in diversity; having withstood the colonial rule but yet impacted, with society entrenched and weaved around considerations of race, religion, caste, community, language and region. A heterogeneous society with overriding concerns of a low income economy and large-scale poverty inherited post­ Independence. The painstaking rebuilding of the economy was a slow and gradual</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">process , culminating in the process of a series of reforms lifting growth , economic empowerment and improvement in standards of living of its people . This is not to say that poverty is no longer an issue. Higher growth has led to a reduction in poverty levels. But, rural India where the heart ol India resides , by and large , has not undergone any significant transformation and a society still, with a traditional outlook and conservative beliefs.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Reforms and their impact on economy and the people have largely been around urban India. The economic  perspective has been dealt in the previous sections. An attempt is made here to understand how it has affected lives of urban India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Growing Middle Class</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">A direct impact of globalization widely accepted is the growing middle class, especially China and India as a part of Brazil, Russia, India, China and S. Africa (BRICS) economies, a potential market of the future with definite increased income, enhanced purchasing power, demand for better variety of goods and distinct improved and changed life style.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This is being observed not only in metro cities but also spreading across tier 2 and 3 cities.</p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This class is creating a niche for newer goods attracting more foreign companies to set up shops. The ‘mall culture’ as shopping and entertainment under one roof, is gradually spreading across a large number of cities, witnessing a large number of foot falls. ‘Fast food’ is gradually gaining acceptability amongst the middle class. Dining out which was once only for the elite society, has now become a common feature of the growing middle class.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Global Goods and Services</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">As has been addressed earlier, one of the objectives which globalization seeks to achieve, is to enlarge the choice set’ of a wider and diversified basket of goods and services, available globally, at ‘affordable’ prices for the people in India. Today, goods and services are moving pan India, without any nationality but as brands, reaching different sections of people. Another notable feature has been goods and services fit every class of consumer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Information Symmetry</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Globalization has not only increased choice set, but also provided for ‘information symmetry’ enabling them to take informed decisions, on their requirements and the best bet for them. This is complete contrast to the earlier information asymmetry, which often resulted in decisions based on the seller of goods, rather than own perception about goods/ services. These information gaps have now been sealed. This has raised levels of awareness</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">of the people who are now better informed. It has also raised levels of knowledge of people cutting across different age groups.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mobile Telephony</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">One of its biggest contributions has been the spread of affordable mobile telephony even into villages, achieving a penetration level of over 80 per cent in about five years. Villages which were earlier cut-off from the communication links due to adverse topography, difficult</p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">and hilly terrains are now well-covered. It has definitely improved communications and also the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">life style of the people in general.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Social Networking</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">An outcome of globalization has been the spread of social networking sites which has allowed a novel way to connect with people irrespective of their location. It provides a wide platform for ‘faceless communication’ and ‘free and frank expression’ of views almost instantaneously across the world. It has allowed ‘discovery’ of friends and acquaintances, of connecting with those people who had lost contact or whose whereabouts were not known. This has led to a more ‘open society’ not bound by caste, creed or religion.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cross Border Cultural Engagement</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Thanks to the growing middle class for increasing income, together with air travel becoming cheaper, has promoted cross border tourism, with many Indians travelling abroad for vacations and holidays, increasing their exposure to different people and culture of different countries. Further, there is also an increase ‘in bound tourism’ with more and more foreigners  visiting in India which has increased  cross  border cultural engagement. This has led to better understanding and acceptability of different cultures and developing mutual respect of each other.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Emergence of a Harmonized Culture</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Globalization has resulted in not only greater cross border cultural engagement, but also marks emergence of a harmonized culture, with cross border acceptability. This culture can be seen, in the perceived preferences for unisex personal wear, celebrations such as</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">fathers , mother ’s and valentine ’s day. This harmonized culture cuts across caste and creed , fostering a cohesive society.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Changing Role of Women</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Women have always occupied centre stage in society. There are an increasing number of women today who are seeking a career, being independent, leading a life as they wanted, rather than being directed by a family. The more important aspect is acceptance of this fact by the society, of going beyond running homes and marriage as the ultimate for any girl. They today have the same status as their male counter parts, commanding respect from them. Many Indian women have reached the top of the ladder both in India as well as globally. Many jobs which were considered as male bastion are now being performed by women. Flying aircrafts, army, police, etc., now have sizeable women participation. Dowry system which virtually had become institutionalized in the past has seen a decline.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, can we say that this globalization has not impacted society’ in any adverse manner? While globalization has been able to expand the middle class, there is now an upper and a lower’ middle class with wide income in equality. It has led to consumerism. But it cannot be attributed to the process of globalization, as in general income levels have increased and as mentioned previously, globalization has only allowed for increase in the choice set for the consumers’.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">But the present society has become more materialistic; life styles have become fast tracked, lesser time for relationships, with everyone in a rat race of out doing the other. Satisfaction levels have become relative and craving for more. Nothing wrong with this, except that it has led to increase in health disorders and an early ‘burn out’ of the people.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Even though women have now changed and bigger role, crime against them, in particular has increased. Cases of physical abuse, marital discords leading to divorces</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">ave only increased. Newer concepts of ‘live in relationships have emerged. Urban India as become more liberal and modern in outlook especially the young generation. Their ddiction to the internet and social networking sites has led to their abuse. Extensive use f mobile for purposes, other than communication has increased, resulting in distraction nd taking them away from studies.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 8pt;    text-align: justify;">There is also an exodus of students going abroad for higher studies and seeking mployment overseas, resulting in ‘brain drain’ from India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Can it be said that globalization has been a bane for society? Globalization is not only bout India, it has been a wave encompassing the world economy and cannot be seen as a bane either from the economy or societal perspective. It is not about an option but about cceptance as part of global integration. As a process, it cannot be faulted and its abuse is not a fault of the process. Social ills seen as fallout of globalization have always been there only that now they have been highlighted. Globalization is about economic betterment and the benefits of such betterment will always be in the society itself. Yes, some may benefit more others less, but benefits will always be there.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">People, society and economy are integral in any development process. Reforms are aimed at not only uplifting the economy as a whole but also provide better standards of iving for its people. Globalization is getting the ‘best’ at the door step of people. It is about our people benefiting from others. It is a blend of the world economy looking for newer markets and our people getting the best of the world. The world order is changing, so also has to be our thinking and perceptions. It is about accepting change. The endeavour should be how to reach out to a larger cross section of people? How to overcome the hurdles which come in the way?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Globalization today is not a subject matter of debate, but a natural process driven across economies, as a necessity, for meeting own needs of economies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s26" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align:justify; ">GOING FORWARD—</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 43pt;    text-align:justify; ">INDIA AND GLOBALIZATION</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">CHAPTER </p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">21</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part129.htm">21.1.
