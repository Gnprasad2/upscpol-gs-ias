It brings benefits to all the stakeholders of industry, government and the consumer. It will lower the cost of goods and services, give a boost to the economy and make the products and services globally competitive . GST aims to make India a common market with common tax rates and procedures and remove the economic barriers thus paving the way for an integrated economy at the national level.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">By subsuming most of the Central and State taxes into a single tax and by allowing a set-off of prior-stage taxes for the transactions across the entire value chain, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading, improve competitiveness and improve liquidity of the businesses.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">GST is a destination based tax. It follows a multi-stage collection mechanism. In this, tax is collected at every stage and the credit of tax paid at the previous stage is available as a set off at the next stage of transaction. This shifts the tax incidence near to the consumer and benefits the industry through better cash flows and better working capital management.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">1. GST is largely technology driven. It will reduce the human interface to a great extent and this would lead to speedy decisions.</p><p class="s61" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">2. <span class="p">GST will give a major boost to the ‘Make in India initiative of the Government of India by making goods and services produced in India competitive in the National as well as International market. Also all imported goods will be charged</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">integrated tax (IGST) which is equivalent to Central GST + State GST. This will bring equality with taxation on local products.</p><p class="s61" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -16pt;    text-align: justify;">3<span class="s49">. </span><span class="p">Under the GST regime, exports will be zero-rated in entirety unlike the present system where refund of some taxes may not take place due to fragmented nature of indirect taxes between the Centre and the States. This will boost Indian exports</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">in the international market thus improving the balance of payments position. Exporters with clean track record will be rewarded by getting immediate refund of 90% of their claims arising on account of exports, within seven days.</p><p class="s61" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">4. <span class="p">GST is expected to bring buoyancy to the Government Revenue by widening the tax base and improving the taxpayer compliance. GST is likely improve India’s ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Index and is estimated to increase the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">GDP growth by 1.5 to 2%.</p><p class="s62" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">5. <span class="p">GST will bring more transparency to indirect tax laws. Since the whole supply chain will be taxed at every stage with credit of taxes paid at the previous stage being available for set off at the next stage of supply, the economics and tax value of supplies will be easily distinguishable. This will help the industry to take credit</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">and the government to verify the correctness of taxes paid and the consumer to know the exact amount of taxes paid.</p><p class="s63" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: left;">6. <span class="p">The taxpayers would not be required to maintain records and show compliance with a myriad of indirect tax laws of the Central Government and the State Governments like Central Excise, Service Tax, VAT, Central Sales Tax, Octroi,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Entry Tax, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, etc. lhey would only need to maintain records and show compliance in respect of Central Goods and Sendees Tax Act and State (or Union Territory) Goods and Services Tax Act for all intra­ State supplies (which are almost identical laws) and with Integrated Goods and Services Tax for all inter-State supplies (which also has most of its basic features derived from the CGST and the SGST Act).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Salient Features of GST</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The salient features of GST are as under:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -26pt;    text-align: justify;">(i) The GST would be applicable on the supply of goods or services as against the present concept of tax on the manufacture or sale of goods or provision of services. It would be a <span class="s9">destination based consumption tax. </span>This means that tax would accrue to the State or the Union Territory where the consumption takes place. It would be a dual GST with the Centre and States simultaneously levying tax on a common tax base. The GST to be levied by the Centre on intra-State supply of goods or services would be called the Central tax (CGST) and that to be levied by the States including Union territories with legislature/Union Territories without</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">legislature would be called the State tax (SGST)/ Union territory tax (UTGST respectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The GST would apply to all goods other than alcoholic liquor for human consumption and five petroleum products, viz. petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel. It would apply to</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">all services barring a few to be specified .

It has been specifically provided that the GST Council, in its discharge of various functions, shall be guided by the need for a harmonized structure of GST and for the development of a harmonized national market for goods and services. The GST Council shall establish a mechanism to adjudicate disputes arising out of its recommendation or implementation thereof.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">National Anti-profiteering Authority</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">National Anti-profiteering Authority under GST will be the apex body, which is mandated to ensure that the benefits of the reduction in GST rates on goods or services are passed on to the ultimate consumers by way of a reduction in prices. The National Anti­ profiteering Authority (NAA) will be headed by a senior officer of the level of Secretary to the Government of India with four Technical Members from the Centre and/or the States.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">NAA aims at comforting consumers that Government is fully committed to taking all possible steps to make sure the benefits of implementation of GST in terms of lower prices of the goods and services reach them. The “anti-profiteering” measures are enshrined in the</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">GST law, which provides an institutional mechanism to make sure that the full benefits of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">input tax credits and reduced GST rates on the supply of goods or services flow to the consumers. This institutional framework comprises the NAA, a Standing Committee, Screening Committees in every State and the Directorate General of Safeguards in the Central Board of Excise &amp; Customs (CBEC).</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">NAA work for affected consumers who feel the benefit of proportionate reduction</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">in prices is not being passed on when they purchase any goods or services may apply for relief to the Screening Committee in the particular State. However, in case the incident of profiteering relates to an item of mass impact with ‘All India ramification, the application may be directly made to the Standing Committee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Input tax credit</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Taxpayer is allowed to take credit of taxes paid on inputs (input tax credit), as self-assessed, in his return. Taxpayer can take credit of taxes paid on all goods and services, other than a few items in the negative list, and utilize the same for payment of output tax. Credit of taxes paid on inputs can be taken where the inputs are used for business purposes or</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">for making taxable supplies. Full input tax credit shall be allowed on capital goods on its receipt as against the current Central Government and many State Government practice of staggering the credit in more than one installment.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Unutilized input tax credit can be carried forward. The facility of distribution of input tax credit for services amongst group companies has been provided for through the mechanism of Input Service Distributor (ISD).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">IT Preparedness</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Putting in place a robust IT network is an absolute must for implementation of GST. A Special Purpose Vehicle called the GSTN has been set up to cater to the needs of GST. The GSTN shall provide a shared IT infrastructure and services to Central and State Governments, taxpayers and other stakeholders for implementation of GST. The functions of the GSTN would, <i>inter alia, </i>include: (i) facilitating registration; (ii) forwarding the returns to Central and State authorities; (iii) computation and settlement of IGST; (iv) matching of tax payment details with banking network; (v) providing various MIS reports to the Central and the State Governments based on the taxpayer return information:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">(vi) providing analysis of taxpayers’ profile; and (vii) running the matching engine for matching, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The GSTN will also make available standard software for small traders to keep their accounts in that, so that straight away it can be uploaded as their monthly returns on GSTN website. This will make compliance easier for small traders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s47" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13.10 <span class="s4">BLACK MONEY</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Black money has nothing to do with the colour except to convey that it is necessarily an evil. It is an unaccounted income, earned through illegal channels and put to unproductive anti-national use and conspicuous consumption. Checking black money and tax evasion are the critical aspects of tax compliance.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Black money gets generated when big transactions are performed in cash, source and end use not possible to ascertain . For example , a friend gives you  cash of ₹1000 . Technically, it is black money, may be not so in your case because the amount is small. However,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">say somebody gives ₹10 lakh in cash it is definitely black money.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In other way, all transactions where payments have to be made or received beyond a level of say ₹ 10,000 and above if done in cash is black money. Or still differently, transactions performed other than by way of cheques , drafts, credit cards, debit cards, direct transfers of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">money in bank accounts would be black money.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">If you deposit ₹10 lakh in cash in your bank account it is black money (unless and until if you show the source from where you got it). If your father sends you a cheque of the same amount and you deposit it in your bank account it is a ‘white transaction . Thus , transactions performed other than through banks and post offices would generate black money.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Why does black money ger generated? The primary reason for the black money generation is high tax rates, complex tax laws and provisions, strict controls on transactions, large amount of cash dealing, people not having bank accounts, land and property deals in cash, need for money to get jobs performed through various government departments, donations required for admission in schools and colleges, meeting dowry needs, compulsions of social functions and also for doing illegal activities both within and outside the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What has the government done to curb black money? Not much except the voluntary disclosure schemes and giving amnesty for the amount disclosed and demonetization of higher denominated currencies. (Recall India had earlier ₹5000 and ₹ 10,000 notes which have</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">now been discontinued and cease to be legal tenders.)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The government has also declared that all transactions over ₹10,000 should be done through cheques/drafts. Drafts would not be made by banks against cash exceeding ₹50,000 in one day. A permanent account number (PAN) has been issued to all tax payers and it is mandatory to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">quote the PAN number for all transactions over ₹50,000.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The income tax offices at the four metros have been computerized and networked, creating a database of tax payers and transactions being performed by them. All Registrar offices registering land deals, credit card companies, automobile manufactures, etc., are required to furnish information beyond a cut off level.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The government with a view to have better tax compliance, lesser tax evasion, is proposing the direct tax code which would simplify tax laws and provisions, plug leakages, raise exemption levels and consider further lowering tax rates. However, till then tax compliance will be a major constraint to further raise tax revenue for the government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Demonetisation Policy: Surgical Strike on Black Money</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">On November 8, 2016, the government announced a historic measure, with profound implications for the economy. The two largest denomination notes, Rs 500 and Rs 1000,were “ demonetized ” with immediate effect , ceasing to be legal tender except for a few specified</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">purposes. At one fell stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation was thereby rendered invalid. These notes were to be deposited in the banks by December 30, 2016 , while restrictions were placed on cash withdrawals . In other words, restrictions were placed on the convertibility of domestic money and bank deposits.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The aim of the action was fourfold: to curb corruption; counterfeiting; the use of high denomination notes for terrorist activities; and especially the accumulation of “black money”, generated by income that has not been declared to the tax authorities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It followed a series of earlier efforts to curb such illicit activities, including the creation of the Special Investigative Team (SIT) in the 2014 budget; the Black Money and Imposition of Tax Act 2015; Benami Transactions Act 2016; the information exchange agreement with Switzerland; changes in the tax treaties with Mauritius, Cyprus and Singapore; and the Income Disclosure Scheme. Demonetisation was aimed at signalling a regime change, emphasizing the governments determination to penalize illicit activities and the associated wealth. In effect, the tax on all illicit activities, as well as legal activities that were not disclosed to the tax authorities, was sought to be permanently and punitively increased.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the wake of the demonetisation, the government has taken a number of steps to facilitate and incentivize the move to a digital economy. These include:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Launch of the BHIM (Bharat Interface For Money) app for smartphones. This is based on the new Unified Payments Interface (UPI) which has created inter-operability of digital transactions. The 250 million digital-haves can use their smartphone to make simple and quick payments.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Launch of BHIM USSD 2.0, a product that allows the 350 million feature phone users</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to take advantage of the UPI.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Launch of Aadhaar Merchant Pay, aimed at the 350 million who do not have phones. This enables anyone with just an Aadhaar number and a bank account to make a merchant payment using his biometric identification. Aadhar Merchant Pay will soon be integrated into BHIM and the necessary POS devices will soon be rolled out.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Reductions in fees (Merchant Discount Rate) paid on digital transactions and transactions that use the UPI. There have also been relaxations of limits on the use  of payment wallets. Tax benefits have also been provided for to incentivize digital transactions.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Encouraging the adoption of POS devices beyond the current 1.5 million, through tariff reductions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Benefits of Demonetisation</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Tax on black money: <span class="p">The most important way to view demonetisation is as a tax administration measure, one designed to tax holdings of black money. Of course, demonetisation of large denomination notes is not exactly the same as demonetisation of black money. Some cash holdings were perfectly “white”, the fruit of income upon which taxes had either been paid or had not been applicable in the first place (agricultural income, for example).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Cash holdings arising from income that had been declared could readily be deposited at banks and ultimately exchanged for new notes. But those with black money faced three difficult choices. They could:</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Declare their unaccounted wealth and pay taxes at a penalty rate;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -16pt;    text-align: left;">• Continue to hide it, not converting their old notes and thereby suffering a tax rate of 100 percent; or</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Launder their black money, paying a cost for converting the money into white.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Tax compliance: <span class="p">Demonetisation can also be interpreted as a regime shift on the part of the government. It is a demonstration of the state’s resolve to crack down on black money, showing that tax evasion will no longer be tolerated or accepted as an inevitable part of life. Since this action has commanded support amongst the population, demonetisation shows that black money will no longer be tolerated by the wider public, either.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Demonetisation could also aid tax administration in another way, by shifting transactions out of the cash economy and into the formal payments system. With large denominations eliminated, households and firms have begun to shift from cash to electronic payment technologies.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Tax on informal savings: <span class="p">Beyond reducing tax evasion, demonetisation could have other farreaching effects. For example, it will channel savings into the formal financial system. Without doubt, much of the cash that has been deposited in the banking system</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">will be taken out again, as the cash withdrawal limits are eased and the note supply mproves. But some of the new deposits will surely remain in the banks, where they will provide a base for banks to provide more loans, at lower interest rates.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the longer-term, if demonetisation is successful, it will reduce the equilibrium cash- GDP and cash-deposits ratio in the economy. This will increase financial savings which could have a positive impact on long run growth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s47" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13.11 <span class="s4">VIEWS ON TAX COMPLIANCE</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) Has it ever occurred why people do not want to pay taxes? Paying taxes globally is a matter of pride  and  joining hands with  the  government to provide  better  for  the masses and improved civic amenities. Not so in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) That is, because, people doubt the intentions of the government in using it productively  for the masses. Tax compliance would thus require austerity measures on the government lesser lavish spending and more responsiveness and sensitiveness towards the spending for masses.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Tax compliance should be top-driven. Have you ever seen any top political leader, bureaucrat going to file his income tax return at the IT office in-person. No! it is not required officially but it sends the right message to people that how it is of high priority despite their busy schedule. Who is the first person seen as voting in an election? It is the President, Prime Minister and other top leaders. ‘Why?’ Just to send the right message to the people to come out and cast their vote.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Hence tax compliance should start right from the top. The President, PM, Chief Ministers and senior leaders all of them filing their tax returns in-person.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) Who is the highest tax payer in the country? It is difficult to say or even more difficult to say who are the top 100 tax payers in the country. What prevents the government from honouring them at a public ceremony acknowledging their contribution to the national cause? It will transmit positive signals and encourage people to pay their taxes.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) What if one is seen by one’s friend or relative at the income tax office? It would definitely not be positive. The perception of the income tax officials has got to change from treating everyone as a tax evader to that of trust, a friend guiding and supporting the people. Let them have ‘May I help you counter’ at their offices for any assistance people may want. They could send out staff to assist tax payers in correctly filing their returns. It should not be difficult but could go a long way in increasing the compliance.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) It is not difficult to find out regular tax payers, a small well-worded thank you card can be sent to them each time after they have filed their return. Today, technology support is available to generate such computerized letters. What is being meant here is that the incentive for a tax payer to pay his taxes, a mere token of appreciation can work.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(8) Our policies for tax evasion can be said to be ‘soft’. What is required is strong punishment for tax evaders, those generating black money uniform for all irrespective of whether political leader, bureaucrat, private organization, etc., to serve as a lesson and a source of discouragement.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">While tax compliance would remain an issue, still there are some other issues which can help augment revenue to the government like completely simplified tax regime based on income at low rates with no exemptions easily enforceable and minimizing leakages.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">What is a an efficient tax system? An efficient tax system should allow for raising revenue without burdening the common man. It should provide for BECN briefed as below:</p><p class="s70" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">B <span class="p">buoyancy (raise tax revenue with increased growth of an economy rather thanby changing the tax rates).</span></p><p class="s71" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">E <span class="p">effectiveness (promoting tax compliance).</span></p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">C <span class="p">cost-effective (lower cost of collection with increased tax revenue).</span></p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">N <span class="p">neutral to economic decisions (not influencing location of businesses).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The present tax structure in India is still evolving and moving in the right direction of a GST for indirect taxes and direct tax code for direct taxes. While all these efforts at increasing tax compliance are appreciable there are other issues which should also get adequate attention of the government and that is cost of collection of taxes is continuously increasing. There is a requirement to arrest this trend and ensure higher collections at lower costs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other is given the inflexibility of expenditure, there is scope for rationalizing government expenditure by reviewing the requirement for so many ministries, merging ministries for sharper focus, abolition of vacant posts, greater austerity in government spending and small expenditure cuts wherever feasible. It is these small cuts which would make the picture larger. And for once economics should prevail over political compulsions in the larger interests of the economy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Typical Budget in India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">We have covered public expenditure, taxes and different kinds of deficits as part of the budgetary process. A typical budget presentation initiates with a review of the economy in terms of the Economic Survey presented in the Parliament (a few days before the budget is presented), which is followed by the expenditure proposals and finally the tax proposals which most anxiously awaited by all.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All receipts in the economy are retained in the consolidated fund of India and money can be utilized only after the budget is passed by both the Houses of Parliament, which is that Parliament provides approval for various expenditure and permits withdrawal of funds for various  expenditure needs of the economy. Certain expenses can be incurred by the government without the approval of Parliament and are known as ‘charged expenditure’ such as meeting interest obligations, salaries and emoluments to constitutionally appointed heads such as chief justice of India, CVC, CAG, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There are two other kinds of budgets interim and vote on account. Interim is a kind of budget addressed for a period less than a Rill year. Vote on account is not a type of budget strictly, but seeks approval for ongoing expenditure needs, no fresh expenditure or tax proposals. This is normally presented when the government is about to face elections or when the time period is too short even for an interim budget to be presented. In any case, the choice of the type of budget to be presently lies with the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In case, election dare has already been announced the election commission is empowered to restrain the government from presenting an interim budget but present a vote on account only. Traditionally, budgets are shrouded with secrecy and it lacks transparency.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">There should be greater and broader participation of people from all walks of life to ensure</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">budgets being prepared are not only of the government but also of the people.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The budgets are focused on ‘outlays’ or spending under different heads but no provision is made to know the outcome’ of such spending. The ocher aspect is the outlays are not linked to the actual need. For example, the budget might propose increased outlay of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">say ₹100 crores on education in comparison to an increase of only ₹ 50 crores in the last budget . However, there is no mention of how much actually needs to be spent on education in total.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part82.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part84.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
