Let us recall the concept of ‘monetary value of goods and services’ as output which has been discussed in the beginning of the chapter.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">But this monetary value can be viewed from two perspectives— factor cost (It is also the income for the factors of production) and market price for example the price of a car as illustrated earlier. To further elucidate, the market price is the price paid for a goods or services in the market. Let us discuss the differences between the factor cost and market prices?</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">We all know that the government levies taxes (and also gives subsidies) on different</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">goods and services before they reach the market. In India, excise duty is payable on manufacturing of goods and similarly, service tax is payable on services provided (we will discuss these later in the Chapter on government finances).</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now,</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: center;">Factor Cost + Indirect Taxes - Subsidies = Market Price or</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: center;">Factor Cost + Net Taxes (as subsidies can never be equal or more than taxes in an</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">economy) = Market Price.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Now the question, that in the monetary value whether factor cost or market price should be taken?</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The output measured at market prices can be increased by increasing taxes in an economy. This does not necessarily imply that more goods and services have been produced in the economy. Output of an economy is worked out both at market prices as well as factor cost, but for growth purposes, output at factor cost is considered. This means that increased value in production of goods and services in an economy is captured at factor cost and not at market prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The difference between the output at market price and at factor cost is tax burden on an economy, which is useful for cross-country comparisons.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Can output at market price and factor cost be the same? The answer is yes, in cases of exceptional circumstances where the taxes are equal to subsidies or in utopian circumstances where taxes and subsidies both are zero. This concept is more of an academic relevance rather than of practical utility.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The moment we start talking about the monetary value either at market prices or factor cost, the concept of inflation becomes important. In simpler terms, inflation is increasing prices and during inflationary times it tends to inflate the value in nominal terms. Suppose inflation is at 10 per cent, it implies that the price is going up by 10 per cent, that is to say that the factor cost is also increasing, which would increase the output, even though there is no physical increase in the production of goods and services. It is because of this reason that the output measured at factor cost would have to be adjusted to actually reflect the increased production of goods and services in an economy. The adjustment is a statistical exercise which is done by using the GDP deflator that gives the output at factor cost in terms of constant prices’.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The output at constant prices refers to the output obtained after being adjusted for inflation. To further explain, suppose we do not adjust for inflation and the output growth for an year is 9 per cent so is inflation. It means that the output has not increased, but their prices have increased. Without adjusting for inflation, the increase in output has little or no significance and actually could be misleading.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This adjustment for inflation is also known as ‘real’ or otherwise it is ‘nominal’ and is generic in nature. Real growth is adjusted for inflation while nominal growth ignores adjustment for inflation. Growth by definition has to be ‘real’.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Similarly, there is ‘nominal’ and ‘real’ interest rate, income, wages, but there is no concept of nominal and real growth as growth by definition has to be adjusted for inflation. This is implied in the meaning of the word growth itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The use of the word ‘growth’ in the Indian context implies increase in GDP at factor cost at constant prices.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In India, the entire computation is the responsibility of the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), Government of India. The estimates of growth are provided by the organisation on quarterly basis at the end March, June, September and December every year and the annual growth estimates are provided during April-March, every year which is also referred to as the financial year (calendar year is January-December). All the government and corporate accounting in India is with reference to the financial year.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What we have covered so far is a simple exposure to ‘National Income Aggregates’, also referred as ‘National Income Accounting’ for students who do not have exposure to economics.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There are three methods of computation  of National Income, namely  output  method, income method and expenditure method relevant for the students who want to pursue a career in economics. The bird eye view of three methods of national income accounting is highlighted in following diagram.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Method of Measurement of Nl: At a Glance</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part3.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part5.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
