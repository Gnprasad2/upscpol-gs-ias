The industrial sector plays an equally important role as it accelerates growth of economies, provides self-reliance, employment, creates a demand for the agricultural produce and creates ‘ripple effect’ (similar to throwing a pebble in a pond and you can see the waves moving outwards).</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Industries can create townships around them thereby creating indirect employment (Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bhilai are a few to mention here). Industrialization is all about focusing on the industries allowing them to meet the requirements of the economy besides providing linkages to the agricultural sector and also employment opportunities in the economy. This can be achieved only through higher industrial growth which can provide momentum to overall growth and also make it sustainable in future.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There has been a missing link in India of the industrial/manufacturing sector, despite policies and governmental focus, not playing its role of creating linkages with agricultural sector and also creating desired employment opportunities. The services sector becoming a major contributor to output rather than the manufacturing or the industrial sector. Such sectoral composition in favour of services does happen but once industrial sector has achieved a level of maturity emerged globally competitive and the service sector supporting higher levels of growth of economies, which has not happened in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Let us understand industry a bit more closely. It implies conversion of any raw material into a finished good or a manufacturing activity producing wide range of goods which is required in the economy. Industries can also be categorized across the following features:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">1. Products—<span class="p">basic industries (steel, cement), capital good industries (manufacturing of plant and machineries). Intermediate goods industries (manufacture of dyes, tools, etc.,) and consumer goods industries (manufacture of cars, scooters, fridges, TV, etc.,). The consumer goods industries are also known as ‘White Goods Industry’.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">2. Ownership—<span class="p">government (public sector), private and foreign (private sector), public and private sector (joint sector).</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">3. Scale of investment in plant and machinery—<span class="p">large industries (investment in plant and machinery of over ₹10 crores ), medium industries (T 1-10 crores ), small -scale industries (₹ 10 lakh to ₹ 1 crores), village and cottage industries (less than ₹ 10 lakh).</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">4. Capital/Labour intensity—<span class="p">capital intensive industries (larger capital intensive in relation to labour) and labour intensive industries (larger intensity of labour in relation to capital).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Economies desirous of pushing up rates of growth of their economy, would need industrial goods for development and shift focus on setting up basic and capital goods industries commonly known as initiation of the process of industrialization.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India started its journey of industrialization during the second five-year plan (1955/56- 60/61). The pattern of industrialization in India is also known as the ‘Mahalanobis Model’ (an Indian scientist) with the setting up of basic and capital goods industries by the government directly, strongly influenced by the Russian model of state-run industries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part47.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part49.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
