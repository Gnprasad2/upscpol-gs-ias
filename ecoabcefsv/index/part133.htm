SEZ is a defined geographical area clearly demarcated with boundary, within the domestic economy, but insulated, known as SEZ.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">To provide with a crude example something like a prison insulated from the outside world. Or it is almost like having another country within the same country from an economic perspective. The SEZs are only physically located in the country&#39; but for all practical purposes they are as if outside the country and are deemed foreign areas.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">With the concept of SEZ, two other concepts emerge—one is the domestic tariff area (DTA) which is the rest of the domestic economy and the other, rest of the world (ROW). The SEZs have world-class infrastructure for manufacturing goods and service providers exclusively for exports. No duties or taxes are payable in the SEZs. All goods coming into the SEZs either from the DTA or ROW would not attract any duty or taxes. No import duty is payable on any imports into the SEZs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Private and foreign companies can set up industries without any restrictions from the government, except for a small negative list which would not be allowed. Producers in the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">SEZs would enjoy tax holiday for five years on profits earned and 50 per cent taxes would be payable for the next five years. Labour laws are flexible and contractual employment is permitted. A slight modification to the provisions of the SEZ act has been imposition of minimum alternate tax (MAT) on profits earned inside SEZs&#39;.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The basic logic is allowing production without any hindrances of either infrastructure or the government or labour issues. The other is to attract private sector and foreign investment. Ideally, the entire production structure in an economy should operate similarly. However, it may not be possible for large economies as a whole thus the need to create pockets of ideal conditions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Lack of such conditions lead to delayed production, increased cost of transactions and excessive documentation required for exports, which would all be resolved at the SEZs. SEZs in China have largely been responsible for increasing their exports and overall growth besides attracting significant foreign investment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Key Features of Special Economic Zones (SEZs)—China and India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s95" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1 S.

China took a lot of time  in deciding  the  locations  of  SEZs  after  considering  all aspects such as strategic and proximity&#39; to important centres. SEZs are driven by the Government in China while their counterparts in India are being driven by the private sector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">SEZ and EPZ</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The government prior to SEZs had the concept of export processing zones (EPZs) also known as free trade zones, first one being the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Kandla Free Trade Zone (KFTZ) during 1965, followed by seven other EPZs in the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Santa Cruz Electronic Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ), Mumbai. Visakhapatnam Export Processing Zone (VEPZ), Andhra Pradesh. Surat Export Processing Zone (SEPZ), Gujarat.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Noida Export Processing Zone (NEPZ), Uttar Pradesh. Falta Export Processing Zone (FEPZ), West Bengal. Chennai Export Processing Zone (CEPZ), Tamil Nadu. Cochin Export Processing Zone (CEPZ), Kerala.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The experience with EPZs has not been particularly good in terms of export performance and there are a number of inherent limitations. Activities were primarily processing in nature.They have played only a supplementary role in increasing overall exports from the country and have logistics issues. The SEZs are seen as a way out for the EPZs. There are some key differences between the earlier EPZs and the now promoted SEZs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s95" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">S.No. Features EPZs SEZs</p><p class="s92" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: -106pt;    text-align: left;">1.

Would operate as off-shore banking units (OBU) and the same status as if operating outside the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The SEZs are much broader and will play a more dominant role in increasing exports and also accelerating private and foreign investments, than EPZs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Status of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">As, a first step all the EPZs have now been designated as SEZs. Promotion of SEZs in India is through the SEZs Act 2005. The government has formally approved 423 SEZs. Though in recent times due to global slowdown and also problems of land acquisitions the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">pace in setting up of SEZs as slowed down. Once all the SEZs are operational, it would have come across an investment of over ₹5,00,000 crores, the highest ever in India outside the government and provide direct employment to over 10 lakh people and another 10 lakh as</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">indirect employment.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is likely to increase the exports exponentially and double our share from the present level of just over 1 per cent in world exports of goods over the next decade. SEZs in India are seen as a signal of the high degree of openness, innovativeness, unparallel, unprecedented, bold initiatives surpassing even China in terms of the number and expected wide impact of such SEZs in India. They are the next generation drivers of exports, investments and growth and also have the potential and power to transform the economy beyond the realms of reality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Opposition to SEZs</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">There are a number of reasons for the SEZs model shrouded with controversies some genuine, others mere apprehensions and some misplaced notions.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) First and foremost is the revenue loss to the government on account of various tax exemptions of over ₹ 1,00,000 crores.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This is true, however, but then the tax exemptions should be seen in the larger</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">context of overall gains likely to accrue, that of increased exports, investments and employments generated. In any case, tax exemptions are not for ever but only for five years. Already MAT has been introduced recently.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) Lack of transparency in land acquisition, exploitative tendencies of real estate developers, issues relating to resettlement and rehabilitation of those displaced. These are genuine concerns. But the recently passed land bill is likely to address these concerns.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Arable and fertile land would be acquired for SEZs adversely affecting production and threatening food security. This is not brought out by facts.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All SEZs once operational will occupy only 0.015 per cent of the land area and onl.y 0.1 per cent of the arable land in the country. This is not any material shift away from agriculture to affect production or food security in the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Private developers will view SEZs more as real estate project rather than the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">infrastructure projects. The government to obviate this has strict area norms and completion schedules.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) Units would get relocated from DTA into SEZs to take benefit of various tax exemptions. The objective of SEZs is to promote exports and only those units would get relocated who have sizeable export market and not those who view DTA as their markets.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) SEZs would create ‘islands of prosperity’ and ‘oceans of glooms’ accentuating inter- and intra-regional imbalances.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">SEZs are supposed to be developed through private resources and as self-contained for all public utilities insulated from DTA. Investments being made in SEZs will definitely have multiplier effect beneficial for the area around SEZs.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) The heavy investment made by private developers would ‘crowd-out’ private investment in the manufacturing sector leading to their lesser growth. This is solely perceived but not borne out by facts.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(8) Resources available within DTA would get diverted from DTA into SEZs adverse) • impacting investment in DTA.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All the SEZs together constitute a very small part of the DTA and can at best have very limited impact on domestic resources. However, SEZs would also provide for local employment and market for local goods.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(9) Even a country like China which has pioneered the concept of SEZs has only five SEZs, whereas in India there will be more than five hundred SEZs. The government : has been criticized for acting in abundance haste rather than a cautious approach in approving</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">SEZs in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">On first look the criticism is well-taken. However, it is better to understand each SEZs in China is spread over 30,000 hectares. The largest SEZ in China at Shenzen is over 49,000 hectares.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Even the largest SEZs and only a few of them in India would not be over 10,000 hectares. Many of them will be in the range of 1000-2000 hectares. India&#39;s topography does not permit bigger SEZs without encroaching arable land and the already endangered forest cover.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other is the fact that there has been tremendous positive response from the private sector and confidence in the success of SEZs in India. The government did not want to dampen the spirits of the private sector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Moving Forward in SEZs</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Most of the issues around SEZs have now been resolved and the government is committed to ensure timely completion of the projects which are already notified. Notifications of those already approved ensure that the developers do not violate area norms. However, still there are deeper issues in going forward in SEZs in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) So far, all the work relating to SEZs is being handled by the Ministry of Commerce. Government of India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It may be difficult for the Ministry to address the operational bottlenecks, exercising effective control and supervision on private developers. This may increasingly become difficult in future.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There will be a need for an independent government body to have complete responsibility of development, growth of SEZs in India. Something like the IRDA, SEBI and other regulators in the economy. But therein lies the catch of the regulator not bringing back ‘regulations’. It is to play the role of a facilitator, providing oversight mechanism permitting rather than ‘preventing.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) From the approvals given by the central government, SEZs is concentrated in Southern states (44 per cent) and western India (29 per cent) and are mostly in the area of IT and allied areas. This could have implications both for inter- and intra- regional imbalances.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Over 66 per cent of the approval provided is for IT, ITeS, biotechnology&#39; and other services and not for manufacturing hubs as in the case of China.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Similarly many SEZs are in landlocked areas in UP, Punjab and Haryana. How do they find an exit route for export of products?</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) There would be a need to upgrade infrastructure around SEZs especially road, big enough to accommodate the increased traffic coming out of SEZs.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Similarly ports and airports would need to be upgraded which would not come in the domain of SEZs developers. China has constructed huge warehousing facilities near the ports and airports. India needs to construct similar warehouses and also augment capacities of existing warehousing facilities at all the major ports and airports.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The above would need to be addressed urgently by the government going forward. One thing is sure that there cannot be any rethinking on SEZs. It is too late to debate on its need or the model adopted. The SEZs model in India has to be made a workable and as a viable proposition and more importantly it has to deliver. That should the broad approach to be followed collectively by all concerned. SEZs in India as mentioned previously, has the potential to transform the economy but issues raised above would also need resolution.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This strategy in India, even though similar to the concept used in China, but strikingly different in the model adopted by India. As the first of its kind in the world in terms of the large number of SEZs, their relative small sizes, many are landlocked, private sector- driven model.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">In ‘its success in India’, will lie ‘its’ ability of being accepted and emulated as a</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">strategy&#39; for export-orientation and rapid transformation of economies. The recent global slow down has impacted exports and also development of SEZs in India. But these are temporary and would reverse as economies begin to recover and so will the pace of growth of SEZ in future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part132.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part134.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
