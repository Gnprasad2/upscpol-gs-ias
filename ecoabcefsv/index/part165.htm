That is the Importance of US economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It was previously mentioned that the international comparisons are being performed through two yardsticks, one the conventional exchange rate and the other adjusted exchange rate also known as purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. PPP is an adjustment made to the conventional exchange rate to capture differentials in purchasing power for meaningful comparisons of economies. This is done by freezing a common set of goods freely traded, which can be bought for USD 1 and then the price of the same set in other economies. Say conventional exchange rate is USD</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">1 = ₹63 but it terms of PPP say it is USD 1 = ₹9, then adjustment will be by a factor of 7.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">PPP has wider acceptability as a measure of global comparison, whereas transactions are done on conventional market-determined/pegged exchange rates.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Various institutions such as IMF and World Bank do ranking of different economies in terms their GDP, per capita GDP etc., and all ranking is after denominating the parameters in USD. Ranking by them can vary but not divergent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Position of India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">First by the conventional exchange rate, World Bank has ranked India sixth largest globally, with the output crossing USD 2 trillion to reach USD2.59 trillion. The second largest economy after US is China with an output of USD 5 trillion, followed by Japan, Germany and United Kingdom. Even though India has joined USD 2 trillion output club, its share in global output is 2.4 percent.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However by using the adjusted exchange rate or PPP basis, India output increases to USD 9.4 trillion making its the fourth largest economy after US (USD 15.6 trillion) China (USD 12.4 trillion) and Japan (USD 4.3trillion).It can also see that third largest economy after China (USD23.3trillion) and united States (USD 19.39 trillion).</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The GNI per capita is often seen as a measure of increased income of the people, which</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">is the total output divided by the population. This has its own limitations but still useful enough to give a reasonable comparison of income levels across economies. The rank in GNI per capita globally, for both India as well as China, is very low whether seen from conventional exchange rate or PPP basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India GNI per capita in PPP basis is USD 7060 while it is USD 1820 by the conventional method, with a very low rank. China is slightly better placed than India but still low by global standards of a rank of just over 100. Let us look at GNI per capita of other countries. The highest GNI per capita (Atlas method) is that of Isle of Man (USD 82650) followed by Switzerland (USD 80560) USA with its GNI per capita of USD 50,270 is ranked eighth in the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What is the implication of this for India? In comparison to these economies, India is a poor country despite having an output of over USD 3 trillion. Is it because of the large population base? Yes, it can be said so. All the other economies of the world have far lesser population, which translates into a high GNI per capita, not true for countries such as India and China.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What can be done about this? The implication of this is that while output of countries such as India and China are good by the global perspective but not sufficient enough for the domestic economy. The answer thus has to be rapidly expanding output to increase income levels and improve our global rank, but this will happen slowly and over  time spanning decades.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Human Development Index</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">What would understand by “Human development”? We have seen earlier that India’s output (GDP) is the fourteenth largest in the world or by saying that India is the fastest growing economy in the world after china or that India is the second largest market after china.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, we have also seen the low rank in GDP per capita. Realizing that modern economics lacked measurement standards for human development in the overall growth process, two noted Asian economists Dr Mahbub U1 Haq (Pakistan) and Dr Amartya Sen (India) formulated the Human Development Index popularly known as the HDI in the nineties. The first comparison of economies based on HDI was during 1990.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This index is simple, completely objective and measurable to track down the governmental efforts for ‘basic’ human development efforts and useful for ranking countries of the world. The index today has global acceptability and forms the basis for ranking of countries by UNDP in their Human Development Report.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Only three parameters are used in the index. The parameters, their relative weight in the index, their minimum and maximum values is given below:</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Parameter Weight Maximum Value Minimum Value Formula</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Life expectancy at birth</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1/3 85 years 25 years</p><p class="s99" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Education 1/3 <span class="s5">(Value for the country -</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">index of which: minimum value) divided by</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 249pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(maximum value under the parameter - minimum value)</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -9pt;    text-align: left;">(i) Adult 2/3 of 100 per cent 0 per cent literacy ratio 1/3</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -12pt;    text-align: left;">(ii) Gross 1/3 of 100 per cent 0 per cent enrolment 1/3</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">ratio</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">GDP per capita 1/3 USD 40,000 USD 100 (USD in PPP*)</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">*PPP is the purchasing power parity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The value or the index would range from 0 ro 1 and is taken up to 3-digit decimal. The closer the value to 1 it is said good efforts at human development and value lower than 0.500 is said to be not satisfactory. The methodology and criteria has been slightly modified from 2010 by making it more scientific first by converting each of the three parameters into an index.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Secondly, adult literacy and gross enrolment index has been refined into an education index comprising (a) Mean years of schooling index (number of years that a 25-year-old has spent in school) and (b) Expected year of schooling (EYS) which is years that a 5-year- old child will spend in education over a life span.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The composite HDI would be a harmonic mean of all the 3 (All multiplied and then cube root taken).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What is your guess on India’s HDI rank globally? Well of the one hundred and eighty nine countries, India is at 130<span class="s19">th </span>position with HDI value 0.640(2017 data).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What would be your inference from the above? That is to say, as explained previously also, is that the expansion of output though impressive by global standards is insufficient domestically to provide for basic human development in the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The population of US, the largest economy in the world, is even lesser than those below poverty line in India not to talk of the entire population. Then can we say, India’s population that being the second most populous country after China, which is largely responsible for the low HDI rank?</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Well! the answer to that first is, if China can have a better rank with the highest population in the world why not India?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Secondly, traditional thinking has changed and today high population is seen more as an asset rather  than liability  in terms  of  potential  markets,  source  for  domestic  demand and manpower. What is required is their proper harnessing through education, skill</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">development and building human capital. It is in this direction India’s efforts have been modest to say optimistically.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thirdly, one has to realize that curbing population is long protracted effort and has a number of economic and non-economic issues and could span several decades. One cannot wait for population to stabilize before launching developmental efforts or even worst wait for natural calamities to take their own toll.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Curbing population by many countries in the past is now showing adverseness like ageing workforce. India is blessed to have a favourable demographic dividend. India has over 50 per cent of its population under 25 years of age which cannot be said to be the same for any other country in the world today. And like said in the earlier paragraph the population requires only proper harnessing.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Finally, rather than looking at global comparison India should get focused on domestic priorities, needs of the social sector, human development and improving administrative governance at all levels. Look at the domestic requirements and then working to achieve the desired levels of output.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The HDI is a reflection of governmental efforts towards human development and the low<span class="s19">r </span>rank of India should not be seen as a criticism of the government given the large size of the economy. It should serve as a wake-up call for the government to re-orient its strategies, properly align them aimed at basic human development. So that the people in general get the feeling of well-beingness with improved standards of living with growth of the economy and a vastly improved rank at the HDI.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is wrongly perceived that outward orientation is only for exports or capital inflows or for the affluent. This orientation can as well be harnessed to fulfil domestic priorities. A significant role can be played by leveraging education, technology, scientific research, all possible by looking beyond domestic frontiers, outward looking for providing economic betterment for the people.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 50pt;    text-align: left;">It is in this context our earlier section was titled as ‘External Sector—Looking Outwards . And this section ‘The Global Economy and Outlook’, provides a perspective and outlines the broad overall contours of the world economy, extremely relevant, for economies like India, as it treads into a fairly uncertain, turbulent and volatile future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part164.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part166.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
