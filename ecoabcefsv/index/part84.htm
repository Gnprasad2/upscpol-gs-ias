This is done by March. The Finance Bill is not passed before late April or early May. If the Budget is read in January and passed by February-March, it would enable the government to do away with a vote on account for the first three months of a financial year.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: justify;">• Retired and serving officials say the biggest plus would be that the Finance Bill, incorporating the Budget proposals, could be passed by February or March. So, government departments, agencies and state-owned companies would know their allocations right from April 1, when the financial year begins.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: justify;">• It would also help the private sector to anticipate government procurement trends and evolve their business plans.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To dispense with Plan-non-Plan dichotomy in expenditure from 2017-18</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">From 2017-18, the Central Government expenditure will be classified only as capital and revenue spends.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The move is a part of the governments decision to do away with the classification of Plan and Non-Plan expenditure. In line with the government’s decision to dismantle the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Planning Commission, the new spending classification will come at a time when the Five- Year Plan mechanism will also end. Instead, it will be replaced by a medium to long-term planning system under the NITI Aayog.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The classifications in the Union Budget 2016-17 for Centrally-sponsored schemes have already been changed to “core of the core”, “core” and “optimal”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Improving Quality</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Economists have for long argued that Plan and Non-Plan classifications should be done away with and the focus should be on improving the quality of government spending by focusing on the end use of the funds.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Plan expenditure, denotes the more productive use of government resources as investment in various programmes and schemes, but forms a small chunk of the total spending bill. Non-Plan expenditure, on the other hand, is the majority of the government spending and is used for interest payments, subsidies, wages and grants to States.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Plan/Non-Plan will help in resolving the following issues</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">• This distinction of expenditure had led to a fragmented view of resource allocation to various schemes.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">• It had made it difficult to ascertain cost of delivering a service and also to link</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">outlays to outcomes.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">• It had led to bias in favour of Plan expenditure by Centre as well as the State Governments and had neglected essential expenditures on maintenance of assets and other establishment related expenditures to provide essential social services.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">• The merger is expected to provide appropriate budgetary framework that will have focus on the capital and revenue expenditure</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The separate Railway Budget, a 92-year-old tradition, has been scrapped by the centre. The Rail budget will be merged with the Union Budget starting next year as indicated by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley .The government is also in favour of advancing the Budget</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">process, including the date of presentation.The Railway Budget was usually presented two days before the Union Budget.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">From now onwards all the proposals regarding Railway Budget will be part of general budget, which will have a separate discussion on railway expenditure, but the functional autonomy of the Railways will be maintained. The end of a separate Budget will be a relief for the Railways, since its revenue deficit and capital expenditure will now get transferred to the Finance Ministry.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Railways is also facing an accumulated burden of a whopping Rs. 4.83 lakh crore towards execution of 458 unfinished and ongoing projects. With the scrapping of die rail budget, the Railways will also not have to pay a special dividend to the government for getting gross budgetary support. The Railways pays about Rs. 10,000 crore as dividend a year after getting about Rs. 40,000 crore.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">A committee led by Niti Aayog member Bibek Dcbroy on restructuring of the Ministry of Railways had recommended that the British-era legacy of having a separate railway budget should be phased out, merging it with the General Budget.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This step will help raise capital expenditure in Railways which will enhance connectivity in the country and boost economic growth. Functional autonomy, distinct identity of Railways will remain as it is. The merger would also facilitate an integrated and seamless approach towards transportation strategy in the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It has been proposed  to  hold the budget session of Parliament early and present the union budget on February 1 instead of the past practice of it coming only on the last day of February.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The budgets year after year get engaged in micro issues for example taxes on tooth pastes, etc., which is not required. The budget may address broad issues of the tax rates in general rather than go into the minutest of details or should be more macro-oriented and micro-detailing done through annexures, for a better understanding of the underlying macro-issues in a budget.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Such reforms in the budgetary process itself also need to be integrated as part of the larger reforms. All the reforms in the country are around the government but not in the government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part83.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part85.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
