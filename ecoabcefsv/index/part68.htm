Few of the Project Finance Schemes are as below:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• BOOT (Build-Own—Operate-Transfcr)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• BOO (Build-Own-Operate)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• BLT (Build-Lease-Transfer)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• DBFO (Design-Build-Financc-Opcrate)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• DBOT (Design-Build-Operate-Transfer)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• DCMF (Design-Construct-Manage-Finance)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hybrid Annuity Model?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under this model the government will provide a percentage of the project cost to the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">developer to start work while the remaining investment has to be made by the developer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Swiss Challenge Model</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This model of investment explores a way to award a project to a private player on an unsolicited proposal. Such projects may not be planned by the government but are considered important given the gaps in physical or social infrastructure that they propose to fill, and the innovation and enterprise that private players bring. The government may enter into direct negotiations with a private player who submits a proposal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Viability Gap Funding (VGF)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">It means a grant provided to private players to support infrastructure projects of usually having long gestation period. Such projects are economically justified but fall short of financial viability. Through this innovative provision of granting assistance to private</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">players , several projects may become bankable and help to mobilize private investment in infrastructure.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Right Model for India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The above are various investment models which have emerged in recent times especially in post-reforms and also from experiences of emerging marker economies (EMEs). These models are not alternates to each other but are only variants of investment models. At a broad level, investment in India has to be driven by private sector and FD1. However, this</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">will require a large role of the government in providing policy support’ with &#39;a partnership</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 4pt;    text-align: left;">approach and an enabling environment’ back India on the high growth trajectory.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to facilitate natural flow of investment to bring</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The policy support will require well-drafted ‘futuristic policies’ in different areas especially in the areas of ‘pricing and tax matters’. These are the areas of grave concerns affecting investment in the economy. Pricing should be such to induce investment and also at the same time protect the interest of the ultimate consumers. Ar the same rime, it should also be ensured that the pricing is competitive. Similarly, there should be ‘certainty’ of taxes, unambiguous and provide comfort that they would not be applicable retrospectively, unless warranted in exceptional circumstances and that too it should be on a case-to-case basis. Policies should be like goal posts, which are firmly entrenched and visible to all.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">Partnership approach is not to ‘prevent but to allow’ or finding a way of getting things performed but within the policy framework. It is not short circuiting of laid down procedures but looking at them positively. It is about giving speedy clearances through single window approach both at the central as well as state government level.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Enabling environment lies in creating the infrastructure around which such investment can be induced. ‘Reviewing’ various acts which influence  such  investments  like  mining and minerals (development and regulations) act, land acquisition and various labour laws all of which date back to 1950s. There is a requirement to comprehensively review them in totality to make them more relevant to the changed present context.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India is one among the few countries today which is ‘investment starved’ and requiring huge levels of both resource as well as technology intensive investment and requires concerted efforts on the part of the government to play its role to facilitate both private and foreign investment in the country, to reverse the present down turn in India’s growth story.</p><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12</p> <p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part67.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part69.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
