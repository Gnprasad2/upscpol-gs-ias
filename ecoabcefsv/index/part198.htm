The first challenge, as outlined previously of the ability of converting advantages into opportunities and subsequent encashment or  translation into  increased  investment,  output  and income. The second being, the global outlook still has many question marks and uncertainties of the following:</p><p class="s83" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1) <span class="p">Recovery of large economies post-crisis.</span></p><p class="s83" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(2) <span class="p">Fears of double-dip recession.</span></p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(3) <span class="p">Uncertain future of Euro and Eurozone.</span></p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(4) <span class="p">Smaller economic ability to destabilize global economy.</span></p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -16pt;    text-align: left;">(5) <span class="p">Implications of growing sovereign debt of large economies, Implications of a different international reserve currency other than USD.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">These uncertainties impose greater challenge for countries such as India and China for lifting global output.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The changing global axis towards the emerging economies is seen as a welcome feature of the new world order. There are two aspects to understand in this shift, one of the axis being ‘pulled&quot; towards the emerging economies, and the other, of the axis being pushed&quot; towards the emerging economies. Which is happening ‘pulled or pushed?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The global crisis is pushing the axis towards emerging economics as the only way going forward. It is not that something dramatic has happened in these emerging economies, especially India. As we have seen previously, the unfinished agenda before the government</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the pause on economic reforms only re-affirm the aspect of being pushed rather than</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">being pulled.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, the larger question of countries such as India is it ‘prepared’ for such structural shift of the global economy? Capital inflows into these economies was seen as good for them, but large surge inflows recently, has been seen as potentially destabilizing, and has triggered cur­ rency war situations. Most economies have resultantly imposed restrictions of such inflows. India has restrained so far but for how long?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">These inflows are coming because of quantitative easing by the US and not due to any particular positive feature of the emerging economies like India. ‘It is absence of an alternate window which is causing this surge in inflows.’ However, such can also seep into real estate, commodities, besides the stock market and also corporate and sovereign debt market creating ‘asset bubbles’, which by definition, will burst when the economy is least prepared.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">An equally greater challenge for countries like India would be how to manage outflows, asset bubbles bursting, if they happen, once an alternate window is available? Another belief of the new world order is the likelihood of increased penetration of countries, for example, India in the global economy with larger share of exports of goods and services.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Given the market imperfections in India, can it be globally competitive to achieve penetration? India’s export sector continues to lack maturity of understanding the importance of moving up the value chain, rather than, exchange rate movements, as more fundamental, to  achieve the levels of penetration. The integrated global economy would definitely open opportunities, but penetration, will largely rest on ability of countries like India to emerge as globally competitive.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Yet another aspect is that India and China by virtue of their large population are being seen as potential markets but do these markets have income or purchasing power to actually become market as widely believed? That is, besides the above challenges; it will also have a larger set of domestic challenges. They are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) The major challenge of an impoverished India, home to largest number of people living below USD 1 per day, of absolute poverty, malnourished and a large social sector outside the mainstream of development.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) The challenge will be of drawing the vast lot of such people, larger than population of many countries, into mainstream of development.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) A larger challenge as expressed by the eleventh five-year plan and would also get echoed in the twelfth five-year plan, of not increasing rates of growth, but of providing greater inclusive growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) The challenge is thus not growth but how to ensure they are evenly spread to provide broad-based benefits to masses?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Then the issue of a stagnant, traditional and livelihood agriculture. Is the agricultural sector capable and prepared to meet the needs of a growing economy with rising income levels?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Despite all the talk about India as a new economy, India continues to be a country of villages; the soul of India is in the 6 lakh villages.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is not about converting villages into towns. Villages are an essential fabric of the Indian  economy, but  how to  make them self-contained  in  terms  of basic amenities and also provide people in the villages, with a source of income?</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">We have seen earlier, the huge investment deficit especially in infrastructure sector like power. From where does one raise the huge resources required for bridging this deficit?</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This is not to talk about rural infrastructure, which is already crumbling, requiring not only re-building but also fresh investment.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) Even die industrial and financial sectors where reforms have been centred, there is still a large presence of the public sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Will they be competitive and continue to be profitable, as a public sector, in the absence of their privatization, in a rapidly transforming market economy of India?</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) India’s growing dependence on imported crude petroleum will only increase with increased growth.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, how does India insulate itself from sharp volatility in international crude petroleum prices?</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">How does one build energy security in India? Are we concerned of our structural problems in the energy sector?</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) In  the recent past  the government has  been accused  of a ‘policy paralysis’ but in reality  it is more of ‘policy uncertainties’, absence of ‘policy continuity’ and fears of policy reversal’. These are far more critical, influencing the entire economy than policy paralysis. The biggest difference is that policy paralysis can be shrugged off, while others require restoration of faith and that is the challenge of restoration of faith in the government.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">An attempt has been made here to highlight the challenges as India prepares to go into the future. These challenges are not insurmountable, but need to be overcome. However, it will require sustained efforts, desire to overcome, collective political will and above all a realization, on the part of the government, of their criticality and fundamental in reshaping the Indian economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">To reiterate, India has the advantage over other economies but the ability to harness them as opportunities and taping them, whether global or internal, is in the hands of India only. The fate of the Indian Economy in future is within our own hands, collectively and to shake up the government to make India realize its full potential, if not beyond usher in a new India, and restoring India to its past glory and stature, presently confined as leaves of history.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part197.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part199.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
