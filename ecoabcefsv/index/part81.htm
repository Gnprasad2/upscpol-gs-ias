A major source of indirect taxes is excise duty which is payable on value of manufacturing activities in the  economy. Excise duty like  other indirect  taxes  by its inherent structure is regressive in nature.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">For example, the excise duty on salt is 10 per cent on a factory price of ₹10 which means the retail price for a packet of salt is ₹11 with an excise of ₹ 1 per packet going to the government. The price of ₹11 is being paid by a person who is earning ₹5000 per month and also even by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">a person whose earning is ₹1,00,000 per month. The tax burden is higher on the people with lower income and that is what is meant by regressive.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Secondly, multiple excise structure with multiple rates giving rise to different interpretation on tax payable giving scope for evasion, litigations and revenue loss to the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The third issue in excise is the cascading effect of taxes. For example, Maruti buys tyres from MRF company. The purchase price of tyres from MRF would have a component of excise duty, which becomes the input price for Maruti and excise duty has to be paid on the frill value of car. This is known as the cascading effect, that is, taxes increase the manufacturing cost and get again taxed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The government has tried to address the issue by reducing the slabs of excise duty only and lower excise duty on essentials or mass goods to minimize the regressive character. With regard to the cascading effect, the best way to prevent it is by introducing value added tax VAT) which is a tax on the value additions at each stage of production rather than on the finished goods. Provided the federal structure both centre and state government VAT would have to be at both levels.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">An initiation was made with the government by first introducing the modified value added tax (MODVAT) scheme which allowed partial adjustment of duties on capital goods purchased, however, it was restrictive in nature. The government replaced MODVAT with a wider scheme of input credit for the excise duties inputs (raw materials, capital goods and services) purchased for direct use in production known as central value added tax (CENVAT) at the central level during 2004.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A major reform has been at the state level with the replacement of sales tax with state</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">VAT. The credit for this goes to Shri. Asim Das Gupta the then Finance Minister, West Bengal and can be hailed as a landmark in tax reforms.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">‘Why’ it is a major reform? First to make all the state governments to agree for the replacement of sales tax with a state VAT. The sales tax regime was very complicated with different sales tax rates for same products in different states. A state VAT required one product one tax rate’ across all states and to drive a consensus for this was herculean effort as some states would stand to gain and others would tend to lose.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">If in a particular state sales tax was a high of say 24 per cent but the consensus under a state VAT was only 12.5 per cent for that good clearly there would be revenue loss for that state government.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">State VAT made effective from 1 April 2005 has the following salient features:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(1) State VAT is not a new tax but only a change in the way of collecting tax from the final stage to the value addition stage.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(2) This allows for set-off of duties from the tax payable but against original invoices/ challans of the tax paid on the inputs purchased.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(3) There would be a uniform 4 per cent state VAT on 270 mass-consumed goods across</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">all states, a uniform VAT of 12.5 per cent on 280 goods and 1 per cent on gold and silver ornaments across all states.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;">(4) Those with a turnover of ₹ 5 lakh and less would not be liable for any VAT, from ₹ 5 to 50 lakh a composite tax but with no set-off. VAT is payable for turnover exceeding</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">₹ 50 lakhs</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The state VAT has helped in checking tax evasion by introducing a ‘bill culture, transparency in tax administration and collection, increased revenue for the state government. Further, as part of deeper reforms, the government is proposing to integrate taxing of goods and services at differential rate separately into one tax with one tax rate as goods and services</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">tax (GST) with both the centre and states taxing concurrency as the central government GST (CGGST) and the state government GST (SGGST).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This would considerably simplify the indirect tax regime, enlarge the tax base for larger resource generation and thus lower GST rate resulting in lower prices does of goods and services but also in ensuring the revenue for the government not to suffer , the government</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">proposes to implement the GST regime as soon as there is broad based consensus with the states</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">and technology put in place. Reforms in indirect taxes are commendable and the government’ s proposal of propelling to GST would place India with an efficient indirect tax regime at par with other mature economies of the West.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part80.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part82.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
