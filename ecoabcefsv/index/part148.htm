The IMF was set up, first for post-war reconstruction and for greater economic cooperation amongst the countries. Subsequently, its role changed to achieve exchange rate stability of different economies.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Its role since 1970 onwards was to provide loans to economies battling on their respective balance of payments front arising out of the collapse of the fixed exchange rates system, oil shocks and also to those economies opening up as part of global integration but having structural problems on their trade front.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Availing loan facilities from the IMF requires membership, (presently 189 members) by buying a ‘quota’ usually in relation to the output of economies and their stature in the world. The quota in turn determines voting rights for various policy decisions including loans to be provided to the affected economies by the IMF. The quota is bought by paying</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">25 per cent in any of the Widely Accepted Currency (WAC) comprising of the USD, Euro, Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. The remaining 75 per cent can be bought in the home currency and maintained with the central bank of that country but cannot  be withdrawn without authorization from the IMF.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All loan facilities are short-term, provide interim relief and are linked as a percentage to the quota, which carry commercial interest rate with varying repayment periods and strict conditionalities like reforms in the domestic sector for long-term structural adjustment. All the accounts of the IMF are maintained in a neutral accounting currency known as ‘special drawing rights (SDR)’ also referred as paper gold’. SDRs can be converted into any WAC at predetermined rates by the IMF.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Special drawing right is not a currency but only an accounting unit of the IMF and the quota can also be purchased in SDRs. IMF besides lending for trade imbalances and currency-related issues of economies also publishes country papers for use by various governments for qualitative improvements in policy-making.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">They are also playing an important role along with the World Bank Group for eradication of absolute poverty especially in Asian and African countries through its programmes like poverty reduction growth fund (PRGF), which is the only concessional</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">assistance programme of the IMF repayable over ten years. IMF has been criticized for the large dominance of the US and its interest at the IMF is driven by a ‘Washington Consensus, being the largest quota holder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IMF Resources</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Most resources for IMF loans are provided by member countries, primarily through their payment of quotas.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">• Quotas: <span class="p">Quota subscriptions are a central component of the IMF’s financial resources. Each member country of the IMF is assigned a quota, based broadly on its relative position in the world economy.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">• Special Drawing Rights (SDR): <span class="p">The SDR is an international reserve asset, created by the IMF in 1969 to supplement its member countries’ official reserves.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Gold: <span class="p">Gold remains an important asset in the reserve holdings of several countries, and the IMF is still one of the worlds largest official holders of gold.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recent Trends at the International Monetary Fund (IMF)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">With the rebalancing amongst the global economies, emergence of BRICS economies, with their increasing contribution to the world output, a need was also felt to realign the quotas of the IMF by giving them larger share, commensurate with their growing international stature and contribution to the global output. BRIC economies have thus been allocated 6 per cent additional quotas, with India’s share in voting rights increasing from 2.3 to 2.6 per cent, making it the eighth highest quota holder and voting rights from the earlier eleventh highest quota holder.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In terms of quota and voting rights, India ranks behind US, Japan, China, Germany, France, UK and Italy but ranks ahead of Russia and Brazil, amongst the top ten quota holders at the IMF. The rebalancing has doubled the total quota to SDR 477 billion or USD 756 billion.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Post-global crisis, IMF is likely to have a large role in revival but more importantly, functions as a true multilateral financial institution providing greater global financial stability from its present role of currency management. Since, its coming into existence, for the first time IMF has also opened a different window, new arrangement to borrow (NAB), for crisis ridden economies in the euro zone. This functionality would require greater inter-government monetary co-operation, greater transparency in functioning of monetary authorities and the IMF would have to take the lead role.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IMF REFORMS</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">IMF Launches New SDR Basket Including Chinese Renminbi, Determines New Currency Amounts</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Chinese renminbi (RMB) to be included in SDR basket as fifth currency starting October 1,2016</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Ms. Lagarde says SDR basket expansion reflects the ongoing evolution of the global economy and is a significant change for the IMF</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Today, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced the launch of the new Special Drawing Right (SDR) valuation basket including the Chinese renminbi (RMB), and the new currency amounts that will determine the value of the SDR during the new valuation period.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As approved by the Executive Board of the IMF on November 30, 2015, effective October 1, 2016, the RMB is determined to be a freely usable currency and will be included in the SDR basket as a fifth currency, along with the U.S. dollar, the euro, Japanese yen, and tthe British pound. The Board also decided at that time that the weights of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">each currency would be 41.73 percent for the U.S. dollar , 30.93 percent for the Euro , 10.92</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">percent for the Chinese yuan, 8.33 percent for the Japanese yen, and 8.09 percent for the Pound sterling.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">To mark the launch of the new SDR basket, <span class="s9">Ms. Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the IMF, </span>stated: “The expansion of the SDR basket is an important and historic milestone for the SDR, the Fund, China and the international monetary system. It is a significant change for the Fund, because it is the first time since the adoption of the euro that a currency is added to the basket.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In addition, the Board also decided today that effective October 1, 2016, the value of the SDR will be the sum of the values of the following amounts of each currency:</p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:111.332pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:16pt"><td style="width:83pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. dollar</p></td><td style="width:68pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">0.58252</p></td></tr><tr style="height:16pt"><td style="width:83pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Euro</p></td><td style="width:68pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">0.38671</p></td></tr><tr style="height:16pt"><td style="width:83pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chinese yuan</p></td><td style="width:68pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.0174</p></td></tr><tr style="height:16pt"><td style="width:83pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Japanese yen</p></td><td style="width:68pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11.900</p></td></tr><tr style="height:16pt"><td style="width:83pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pound sterling</p></td><td style="width:68pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt"><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">0.085946</p></td></tr></table><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">These currency amounts are calculated such that the value of the SDR in U.S. dollar terms is the same under the new basket as the value of the SDR prevailing today, and that, at the average exchange rates for the three-month period ending today (July 1 through September 30, 2016), the share of each currency in the value of the SDR corresponds to the weight approved by the IMF Executive Board on November 30, 201 5.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India gets more voting rights as IMF implements quota reforms</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">India&#39;s share has now increased to 2.75% from 2.44%, making it the eighth-largest shareholder in the Fund</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Voting rights of emerging-market economies such as India and China have increased at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has finally notified governance quota reforms adopted in 2010. The reforms were held up as the US Congress was reluctant to ratify</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the proposal , fearing a decline in is hold over the institution . It approved the move last month</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">with a set of conditions. India’s share at IMF has now increased to 2.75% from 2.44%, making it the eighth-largest shareholder in the multilateral agency, climbing three notches.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The ratification of the 2010 reforms also clears the way for the institution to begin the next round of review of its quotas to discuss the size and composition of IMF resources and the distribution of quota shares among the Fund’s membership.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">International Monetary Fund (IMF) and India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">India has been major borrower of the IMF before the reforms were initiated. The</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">borrowings had been from various facilities of the IMF. However, all the loans taken by India have not only been ‘repaid but prepaid’ to the IMF and our present outstanding is nil. The IMF also has a financial transaction plan (FTP) which is a plan to help the BOP of impoverished low income countries and only forty-seven strong economies are permitted to lend to the IMF for funding this plan.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India has also been admitted as a lender to the IMF for this plan since 2002. The amount contributed towards the plan is taken as a part of foreign exchange reserves of the country. So far, the contribution made by India to the FTP is USD 205 million.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Probably India would be the only country in the world to have become a lender (creditor) to the IMF, from being a borrower (debtor) just two decades ago. It is also an acknowledgement by the IMF of the strong fundamentals, maturity and growing stature of India post-reforms. With the increased quota and voting rights India will now find a greater, say, in various policy decisions at the IMF.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part147.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part149.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
