The Paris Agreement sets a roadmap for all nations in the world to take action against climate change in the post-2020 period. The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) that were in place from 2000 to 2015 were replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) with the aim of guiding the international community and national governments on a pathway towards sustainable development for the next fifteen years. A new set of 17 SDGs and 169 targets were adopted by the world governments in 2015.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The 22<span class="s19">nd </span>Conference of the Parties (COP-22) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has concluded its meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, with a range of decisions around implementing the Paris Agreement. Following the new global agreement last December, the threshold of signatories for it to enter into force was passed less than 12 months after being agreed and far earlier than expected. This has added pressure to quickly develop the necessary rules and procedures to support the Agreement.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Morocco saw meetings under the Convention, as well as the Kyoto Protocol, and for the first time, the Paris Agreement. The headline outcomes and announcements were:</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: justify;">• Countries gave themselves two years to 2018 to agree rules and procedures for the Paris Agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: justify;">• Technical work produced guidance and questions for work-plans, focusing on: Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); a transparency framework; global stocktake; technology development and transfer; adaptation, and market and non­ market approaches.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• Countries agreed a five-year workplan on Loss and Damage.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• Developed countries launched a roadmap to 2020 on reaching the agreed goal of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">$100bn per annum in climate finance for developing countries.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">• A statement of the need for action and countries &#39; will to act was agreed </span>- the Marrakech Action Proclamation for<span class="s21"> </span>Our<span class="s21"> </span>Climate<span class="s21"> </span>and Sustainable<span class="s21"> </span>Development.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: justify;">• The Climate Vulnerable Forum , which is an international partnership of countries highly vulnerable to a warming planet, committed to update their NDCs before 2020, prepare long- term low -emissions development strategies , and generate 100 % of their energy from renewable sources as soon as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Countries are now already looking to 2020 which is the next milestone in the process There will be a facilitative dialogue that year, with inputs including  an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on the practicalities of a 1.5C temperature objective,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">as well as assessments of Parties collective progress pledges and views from Parties and</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">stakeholders . That will lead to pressure for Parties to raise their level of Nationally Determined Contributions . The next two years are for Parties to agree the details of the dialogue and its inputs and the rules, such as on accounting that will allow a shared view and comparability between countries actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">On the domestic front , India continued to take ambitious targets in its action against climate change. As a part of its contribution to the global climate change mitigation efforts, India announced its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC which set ambitious targets for domestic efforts against climate change. Our country has itself set an ambitious target of reducing its emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33-35 per cent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India has also taken the initiative of setting up an International Solar Alliance (ISA), an alliance of 121 solar-resource rich countries , lying fully or partially between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. This alliance was jointly launched by the Prime Minister of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">India and President of France on 30<span class="s22">th </span>November 2015 at Paris, on the sidelines or the 21st Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC .
