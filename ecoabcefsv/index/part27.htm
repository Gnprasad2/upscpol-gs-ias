The major importers are from Middle East and South East Asia countries. Further, it was also found that the broiler meat (i.e. chicken) sector has witnessed a 30 percent growth rate since the year 2009, at the same time it is placed amongst the fastest growing sectors in the Indian economy at a rate of 8 percent. This increase has been largely attributable to growing domestic demand. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has acknowledged India’s potential and effective measures towards ‘pink revolution’ by fostering modernization of its meat and poultry processing units. Accordingly, in a report titled the ‘Indian Meat Industry Perspective’, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) has recommended an outlined four steps framework that India must adopt and adhere to it for the success of pink revolution are as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Setting up state of the art meat processing plants;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Developing technologies to raise male buffalo calves for meat production;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Increasing the number of farmers rearing buffalo under contractual farming;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. Establishing disease-free zones for rearing animals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Environmental and Health Hazards</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Although, the robust performance of the sector is too lucrative but at the same time there are some environmental riders to be borne in mind. As per an article being published in Environmental Science and Technology Journal, titled ‘Food-miles and the relative climate impacts of food choices in the US’, the data shows United States red meat  production accounts for  30  percent  of total  greenhouse gas emissions so created while poultry and dairy contribute 28 percent of emissions. Thus, now we can cannot be ignorant with the fact that India is now largest exporter of meat in the world which will in turn pointing at the level of green house gas emission. Another vital area of concern is the managing risk w.r.t. meat borne pathogens like E.coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria and Yesinia, also at the same time other diseases of concern to public health, and the control of pesticide residues.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Potential and challenges of Pink Revolution in India</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Growth Potentials</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• To increase present meat consumption per capita of 6 grams approx, per day to 50 grams a day in the next decade or so.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">• India accounts only 2 percent approx of global market in light of large live stock count</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Growing rate is varying between range of between 8-15 per cent annually, and is now worth more than 700 billion dollars.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Challenges</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Drafting of standard policies for the sector w.r.t. meat production and export, standardizing the quality and safety aspects of meat and poultry, and creating infrastructure facilities for modern slaughter houses, meat testing facilities and cold storages for the growth of the meat and poultry processing sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Implementation of 4 areas highlighted by FAO of UN</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Better hygienic methods required in meat and poultry processing</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Channelizing of increased and high volume of investment s in the sector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Government Policies</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• No income tax or central excise.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• No restrictions imposed upon the export of poultry and poultry products, and the government provides some transport subsidiaries.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• 100 per cent FDI is being permitted to tap into available opportunities across the sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Comprehensive scheme being launched for the modernization of abattoirs across the country in order to address quality standards, contamination and deterioration of produce, and the amount of meat wasted.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">More recently, Rainbow Revolution (includes horticulture comprising of fruits, vegetables, floriculture, plantation crops, spices, etc.).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India is one among the largest producers of various agricultural goods in terms of area under cultivation and production; however, it clearly lags behind in the productivity in all major crops which is not sufficient for the domestic market as is evident in their increasing prices. It is not sufficient enough to be satisfied as the largest producer of pulses, coconut, ginger, turmeric, pepper, milk or even the fact that India is the second largest producer of rice, wheat, ground nut, fruits and vegetables. It has to be seen in relation to the relative domestic demand and productivity rather than only production.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India is blessed with large land area whereas, China has lesser arable land than us but its agricultural production  is double than that of India. Clearly, productivity is the chief differentiator between India and China.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Another concern is that the average annual growth of agricultural production right since Independence has been only 2.5 per cent. This is very low keeping in view the domestic needs. Food grains output has been trapped between 175 and 200 million tonnes of which wheat has stagnated around 70 million tonnes in the last few years. There</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">is an urgent requirement to increase the production which can happen only with the increased productivity.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Growth in agricultural production is seen as a multiplier for the rest of the economy as it helps in augmenting supply of food products thereby cooling prices. It also increases income of the farmers and thus greater demand for non-agricultural goods giving incentive to the industrial sector to produce more and provide an upward spiral in growth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part26.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part28.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
