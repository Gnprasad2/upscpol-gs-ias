Infrastructure is also segregated as rural infrastructure (comprises of irrigation, roads, electricity and creation of social assets in villages) and urban infrastructure (comprises of public transport, up-gradation of roads and civic amenities in urban areas).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There is also reference nowadays to soft infrastructure which is education and skill development, human capital development. While all these are important but in terms of criticality it is the overall infrastructure and with increased growth there is need for more than proportionate growth in infrastructural sector investment to match the growth of the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India’s infrastructure can be known to be adequate solely in respect of communications and in all other areas as deficient. Infrastructure globally has certain unique characteristics as mentioned below:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) It is a dynamic concept implying continuous investments in infrastructure. It can never be said to be adequate’.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) Infrastructure growth has to precede growth of economies. First roads need to be re­ built before cars are manufactured or factories can be set up only once electricity is there and not the other way around.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Infrastructure has to be for 365 x 24 hours leaving no scope for reactive maintenance (after break-downs) but has to be proactive maintenance (before break-down).</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Infrastructure development requires visioning, always for the future and not for the present as otherwise given their long periods for completion they would become inadequate once completed.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) Infrastructure always needs to be seen from a global perspective and not from the past history.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) For example, the Government of India can take pride in mentioning that in the last 10 years they have constructed 8000 km of highways a feat never achieved in the past.</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) However, in the same period China has constructed 25,000 km of highways. Infrastructure comparison is always global.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) Infrastructure has always got to be effective’. This can be defined with the following</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">example: Hyderabad airport in India is world class. It has cut down time at the airport, faster check-in can handle manifold more passengers but it is located further away from the city.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Hence, what one has gained in saving the time at the airport has got lost in travel time to the airport. So what effective infrastructure implies is while building the airport simultaneously start the process of either widening the road to the airport and if it is not feasible explore an alternate entry point to the airport from the city.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part57.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part59.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
