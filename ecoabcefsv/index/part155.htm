This is also referred to as dual exchange rate (40:60) in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• This also saw the setting up of foreign exchange dealers association of India (FEDAI), outside the government, to arrive at the market rate of USD based on demand and supply conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Towards the end of nineties, the RBI announced discontinuance of the official rate and only FEDAI determined market exchange rate to prevail, abandoning completely the fixed exchange rate system.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) As trade reforms gathered momentum in the last decade, large inflows, necessitated the RBI to intervene in the foreign exchange market, what is now referred to as ‘managed exchange rate’ in India in an otherwise market-determined exchange rate system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Managed Exchange Rate in India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">How does the RBI intervene in a market-determined exchange rate? Before understanding RBI intervention, let us first understand how exchange rates are market-determined. It is well-known  that market mechanics,  in general,  comprises of demand and supply known as market forces.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Who are the people who demand USD or any foreign currency in India? It will be the importers who will have to pay in foreign currency for their imports, outward tourists, overseas sales promotion, government, those going abroad for education or for health purposes, etc. That is, at any given point of time there will be a demand for USD in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">How is the demand and exchange rate related? If ‘more’ rupees is to be offered to get USD, demand will generally be less. People may feel it is too high a rate to get USD and resultantly the demand is going to be comparatively ‘lesser’. If one was to reflect it graphically, typically it would be downward sloping curve. In the same way, there is a continuous stream of USD and other foreign currencies coming into India from sources such as remittances, foreign investment, NR1 deposits, ECBs, inward tourists, etc. This implies there is also a supply of USD.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As a holder of foreign currency, your tendency would be to exchange the foreign currency if you are getting ‘more’ rupees. That is, to say that ‘more’ USD would be offered for exchange when ‘more’ rupees are being received and vice versa. Thus, the supply curve would be upward sloping. This when superimposed along with the demand curve will give an intersection point which will determine the exchange rate of USD with respect to rupees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The demand and supply curve intersection point in the above illustration is ₹ 40 as the exchange rate of USD . However , let us say that there is a spurt in remittances into India , or surge in any other inflow like through foreign  investment which will mean supply of USD in India will increase and push outwardly the supply curve giving a new intersection point and a new exchange rate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This increased supply of USD would now give a new exchange rate, in the above illustration of USD 1 = ₹38. This means now ‘lesser’ rupees is being offered to USD, which is referred as appreciation of the rupee against a depreciation of USD as USD is now getting ‘lesser ’ rupees than before the increase in supply of USD.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Appreciation of the Rupee</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">So what is the meaning of this? On account of increased supply of USD in relation to what is being demanded , now ‘lesser ’ rupees would be offered than earlier to USD , or differently rupees now gets ‘more’ USD than earlier . This is what is meant by ‘currency appreciation ’ or rupee has appreciated against the dollar. This can also be seen as the USD now getting ‘lesser’ rupees than earlier , or that to get the same rupees ‘more’ USD is required . This is referred as depreciation of the currency, or the dollar has depreciated against the rupees.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Appreciation or depreciation is not in isolation but always in respect to another currency. If we say rupee has appreciated then it is also implied that USD has depreciated. What is the impact on exports from India? With rupee appreciating implies that India’s exportable would now become more expensive in the international market and make our exports price uncompetitive, resulting in declining the value of exports.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">So an appreciating currency adversely hits exports. Similarly, imports would tend to get cheaper, as lesser rupees are required to get USD. It will also balloon the current account deficit. This is the rationale of RBI intervention which is to prevent appreciation of the rupee to maintain price competitiveness of Indian exports and keeping the CAD under check.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">How does the RBI intervene? RBI initiates buying USD from the market, by creating an artificial demand for USD, absorbing increased excess USD in the economy and the exchange rate going back to what it was before the increased supply.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, there is a flip side to this, which is, any act of purchase of USD by the RBI would release rupee in the system and increase the liquidity which can become inflationary. Hence, maintaining export price competitiveness comes at a price of inflation in the domestic economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">To prevent inflationary impact, the RBI simultaneously goes for absorption of the excess rupee by going in for ‘reverse repo auction’ and soaking up the excess liquidity of rupee in the domestic market, which gets created on account of purchase of USD by RBI. This is referred as ‘sterilization of the economy’.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, if the RBI is able to ‘completely’ soak the excess rupees from the market or that it does not lead to inflationary pressures, it is said to have ‘sterilized the economy’. If not, then the RBI has to make a ‘choice’ between export competitiveness and inflation, which is also referred as the ‘prisoners dilemma, of being able to manage one of them, but not both.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other way to intervene is to discourage short-term inflows by imposition of tax, referred previously as Tobin tax. However, the issue is that such a tax will be on all’ kinds of inflows and cannot be discretionary.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This is what is meant by intervention of the RBI in a market-driven exchange rate and the meaning of‘managed exchange rate’.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However is managed exchange rate justified in market-determined exchange rates? Market-determined exchange rate as a concept implies letting exchange rate to be determined outside central bank level and once market determined it becomes a variable, fluctuating and economy accepting’ the exchange rate. Exchange rates should always be witnessed as a  macro tool benefiting the economy at large rather  than being used as  a myopic tool for micro-management. Export is only one of the sectors of the economy and that too contributing not more than 20 per cent of the GDP.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">An aspect gone completely unnoticed is the impact of an appreciating currency on imports into India. Imports become cheaper, and given d our basket comprising of crude petroleum, fertilizers, capital goods, etc., all of which will get cheaper and provide cushioning effect to inflation.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the section on Exports, the aspect of exports has been discussed that it should not be seen as a function of exchange rates but should become neutral to exchange rate fluctuations. This can be done by moving up in terms of value addition, quality and degrees of sophistication.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">More importantly, export promotion as pan of open policies is to achieve global competitiveness, long-term sustainable growth in exports, for which price competitiveness is necessary but not a sufficient condition.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The exports and the exporters have to be sensitized about market-determined exchange rates being known for their uncertainties, fluctuations and volatility and exports have to outgrow and achieve maturity by taking it as a variable and accounted accordingly.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Rather than intervention, India should look at markets other than the dollar denominated, like the Afro-Asian markets which offer a great opportunity to diversify and reduce sensitivity of Indian exports towards exchange rate.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">An appreciating rupee reflects strengthening of the currency against a hard currency which should be good in the long run.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">If the Indian Government is not comfortable to the volatility or the fact that our exports would always be price-sensitive then moving to a market-determined exchange rate was a wrong decision and India, maybe would have been better off, under a pegged exchange rate, like China.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">So can we conclude that intervention by RBI is totally unjustified in market- determined exchange rates? The only justification for RBI intervention is when the inflows are witnessed as short-term, reversible, as portfolio investment or for speculation purposes arising out of global imbalances likely to correct over a period of time.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It should be as a last resort, in exceptional circumstances, of it being seen as destabilizing the domestic economy, creating asset bubbles and fuelling speculation in the economy. Such kind of managing exchange rates during late 2010, by many economies such as Brazil, S. Korea, Russia and Japan have triggered a currency war’, with each economy trying to maintain the exchange rates to preserve their export competitiveness in the wake of increased capital inflows.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Such currency wars are self-destructive in nature and rightfully India has refrained from intervening or managing the exchange rate and has taken a lead in cautioning other economies of the implications of such currency wars.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Every economy has to understand the basic fundamental of increasing exports which is triggered by being price competitive in the short-term, but will not provide for long-term global competitiveness. The other is market-determined exchange rate will always be a variable and exports cannot do piggy back riding on exchange rate for long, but will have to establish their standing in the export market for their long-term sustainability, beyond exchange rates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Depreciation and Devaluation</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">So far our concern has been with the capital inflows, appreciating currency and impact on exports but then there could be yet another situation of capital outflows or the reversal of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">capital outflows or even a sudden spurt in the demand for example, USD or any foreign currency. This is completely opposite to when rupee appreciates on account of inflows. In this case, demand for USD is far more than what is coming as inflows. More rupees would now have to be offered for the same dollar, or the same amount of rupees would get lesser’ USD which implies that rupee would start depreciating. At the same time, the USD would appreciate as it is now getting more’ rupees than earlier or that ‘lesser’ USD is required for the same amount of rupees.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Let us take our earlier exchange rate of USD 1 = ₹40 and with depreciation of the rupees there would be a new exchange rate of say USD 1 = ₹42 . A reference can be made to the graphical illustration given earlier, with either now the supply curve shifting inwards or demand</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">curve shifting outwards.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Now what happens to exports and imports? This implies that exports have become cheaper in the international market as the same USD is getting more rupees now. And imports become more expensive as more rupees are required to purchase the USD for addressing imports. This should be good both for our exports as well as reduce imports and current account deficit. But unfortunately for India, our imports comprise of essentials such as crude oil, import of machineries, etc. This would imply a higher ‘value’ to existing volume of imports, widening CAD and fears of importing inflation.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">A depreciating currency is never seen as a way to promote exports because of larger implications. In a market-determined exchange rate a depreciating home currency has deep fallouts. This has the potential of creating a ‘currency crisis’ or a ‘free fall’ situation, of an ever depreciating home currency marking a complete erosion of faith in the home currency.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This would require the central bank to intervene by selling USD in the market, from its foreign exchange reserves, to augment the supply which is fine, if there is abundance of foreign currency with the central bank, but that would choke liquidity, as rupee would be sucked out from the system, pushing it into a recessionary phase, calling for an expansionary monetary policy to counter the choking liquidity arising out of sale of USD in the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">But there have been instances in the SE Asian economies, of selling foreign currency to stem depreciation of their currency only precipitated further depreciation plunging them into a currency crisis.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, depreciation of the currency in market-determined exchange rates, is never seen as a way to increase exports and central banks in market-determined exchange rates, keeps a close watch especially if the home currency is seen depreciating continuously.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, under the fixed exchange rate system, the central bank ‘deliberately’ changes the exchange rate by offering ‘more’ home currency to a foreign currency referred to as ‘devaluation’ of the currency to promote exports. Even in India, RBI resorted to devaluation in the late sixties and also in early nineties with the same objective and also with a view to test its readiness to move towards market-determined exchange rates and also to discourage imports and making exports price competitive.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">So ‘devaluation’ is deliberate by the central bank, under a fixed or pegged exchange rate, while ‘depreciation is under market-determined exchange rate, arising out of surge of demand or in circumstances of outflows or a decline in inflows of foreign currency.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part154.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part156.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
