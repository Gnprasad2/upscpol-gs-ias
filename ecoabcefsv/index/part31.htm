Of the MSP announced for various crops, the government through Food Corporation of India, as discussed in an earlier chapter, directly procures wheat and rice for meeting buffer stock requirements and also to channelize the food grains to the poor through various government sponsored schemes. For the remaining crops, the government would ensure a price which is higher than the MSP in the market.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Fruits and vegetables are sold to the agriculture produce marketing cooperatives (APMC) of the respective state governments, which also fix the price keeping in view their relative cost and also ensure the farmer obtains a fair price.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The delivery channel has a number of middle men, who serve as bottlenecks and also responsible for increased prices, large-scale hoardings and also prevents the farmer from getting benefits of increased prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The MSP allows a farmer knowing the price which he would get for the produce in the market especially for the food grains, but it is also believed that the benefits largely go to the bigger farmers, besides the MSP has prevented diversification of the agriculture sector . Many critics have favored discontinuation of the MSP , but the large scale small and marginal farmers do benefit, even though a larger chunk of the benefit is reaped by the affluent farmers. Further it may be too pre mature for India, presently to move towards a market pricing for food grains.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part30.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part32.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
