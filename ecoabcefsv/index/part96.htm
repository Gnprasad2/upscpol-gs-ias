Their ability to undertake large-scale lending for infrastructure, risk assessment and their mitigation capabilities are yet to be tested.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">They are having issues of excessive manpower, ageing work force, ‘adopted’ technology</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">but not their successful ‘assimilation, fairly risk averse, overwhelming security conscious­ ness and not able to reach the needy segment like the small-scale sector, despite well-in­ tentioned schemes both by the RBI as well as banks.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As mentioned previously, their efforts at financial inclusion has been far from satisfactory and what is worrying is they still continue to look at it from a social and not as a commercial proposition. Too many nationalized banks of different sizes not allowing for their organized growth and one nationalized bank competing with the other.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India can be said to have survived the global financial sector crisis of 2007, largely perceived because of the public sector character, of not having the exposure to complex products and seen as a prudent banking. But the same public sector character has largely been  responsible  for  not  leading  to  expansion of banks  in the same way  as the private banks are expanding.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">While India’s output is amongst the top five countries, none of the Indian public sector banks figure in the top fifty banks of the world. The requirement of the future would be for them to become stronger to serve as the backbone of an ever growing economy, through a process of</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">consolidation, shedding their risk averseness (not to be seen as uncontrolled risk expansion but</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">judicious risk exposure).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It may be premature at this stage to discuss of privatization, however, will become an imperative in future. This would be in the interests of the public sector banks and the economy as a whole, to meet the expanding growth through innovative products and over time emerge as global bank.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, at the same time a regulatory framework by the RBI with an oversight mechanism which is where RBI has scored over all the other central banks in other countries. Banking in India is still evolving and there is a need to achieve rapid banking penetration. There is also a need for some Indian banks to grow in size and act as global banks. The challenge will be in their ability to meet the needs of the economy, effectively. Their role in infrastructural development and financial inclusion cannot be undermined and can also be said to critical.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Globally, banking is the fulcrum of an economy and on its strengths; economies achieve rapid economic growth and play the role of a facilitator in channelizing smooth flow of resources in terms of needs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part95.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part97.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
