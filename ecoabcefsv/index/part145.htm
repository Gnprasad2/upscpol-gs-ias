Convertibility, as a concept, goes with open economies and little relevance in the era of closed economies. The meaning of convertibility is to treat foreign currency, no different from the home currency for transaction, investment</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and saving purposes whether in the domestic economy or overseas.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Convertibility is linked to absence of restrictions from the government of conversion of one currency into another and also in its end use domestically or internationally. Or coming back to why mentioned in the beginning. If the government/RBI does not ask ‘why’ foreign currency is required or foreign currency, freely, available across the counter, like home curren­</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">cy, is what is know as a convertible currcncy/economy. More specifically convertibility is also about the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Freedom to residents to maintain home currency or foreign currency denominated by bank accounts.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Freedom to residents to remit outside the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Freedom to residents to invest in the global stock markets.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Freedom to domestic companies to borrow funds either from the domestic or from the international markets.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: left;">• Freedom to companies to issue shares/bonds in overseas markets subject to their regulatory compliances.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Freedom to domestic companies for global operations and also to acquire companies overseas.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Freedom to do transactions in any currency.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Freedom to invest globally.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Freedom to exchange currencies like commodities across the counter.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Most of the larger economies such as US and Europe have convertible currencies, which can be freely exchanged with other currencies, without any restrictions and can also be used for transaction and other such purposes as mentioned above.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why is convertibility important for open economies?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) With increased openness, increased trade and capital flows, absence of convertibility is seen as a hindrance to smooth inflows and outflows, resulting in avoidable delays in conversion, besides increasing transaction costs of conversion.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) A convertible currency is acceptable in a non-convertible economy (USD in India) but a non-convertible currency is not acceptable in a convertible economy (Rupees in the US).</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) It is seen from the global perspective as a growing stature of the home currency gaining global acceptability.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) It reflects greater transparency in the foreign exchange transactions in the domestic economy.</p><p class="s96" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: left;">5 <span class="p">It is seen as the growing maturity and strong macro-economic fundamentals of an economy and their ability to withstand adverse global fallouts.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is also believed as a way to attract foreign investment.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">It is a reflection of the confidence of the government that convertibility will not result in outflows from the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">(8) Economies with convertible currencies have greater levels of efficiency, provide depth to the financial sector and are seen as globally competitive.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">(9) Convertibility allows testing of strengths of economies in their bid to global integration.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: left;">(10) It is also about dispelling the ‘fear’ factor, the fear of‘what if from the minds of the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: left;">(11) Most large open economies, as mentioned earlier, such as US and Europe have convertible currencies.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What could be the possible fallouts of convertibility?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) All the crisis-ridden economies in the past had complete convertibility and that convertibility exposes economies and makes them vulnerable, especially in adverse global circumstances.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) One of the biggest dangers of convertibility is known as the fear of infamous ‘Dutch disease’, coined during 1977 following the discovery of oil in The Netherlands. There was a surge inflows resulting in currency appreciating adversely affecting their manufactured exports and slow down of the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) The stance of the monetary policy changes to managing inflows and outflows, managing what is referred as the‘impossible trinity’ of open capital account, exchange rate and independent monetary policy . The central bank can at best manage two but not all</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">three.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Large inflows can create issues of liquidity and result in inflationary pressures besides affecting the growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) The fear factor mentioned above is the apprehension of flight of capital from the country, which can be very dc-stabilizing in nature for the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) It is a one-way journey offering no scope of experimenting or going back. Also having begun the journey it will also have to be completed. It cannot be abandoned mid­ way. This is because over a period of time, it will not be possible to prevent leakages despite having controls on capital flows.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">What can be the basic preconditions to convertibility? It is difficult to lay down a set of defined preconditions to convertibility. It is qualitative in nature, differs from economies to economies and is also about the confidence levels of the government on its own people and the state of the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, based on the experience of other countries having convertible currencies and also of the crisis-ridden economies, some key fundamentals to convertibility are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1) Economies should be on sustained upward growth trajectory.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: left;">(2) Exports should be showing signs of buoyancy and moving away from primary to manufactured goods.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(3) Inflation levels should be ‘manageable’. Economies should have the confidence on their ability to be able to effectively manage inflation through appropriate policy tools.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(4) Interest rates should be globally aligned i.e., the inflows and outflows should be interest rate ‘neutral’.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(5) Current account deficit should be supported by capital inflows or high current account deficit should not lead to external borrowings.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(6) ‘Manageable levels’ of fiscal deficit. The government should be resolved at lowering the levels of fiscal deficit and should have initiated fiscal consolidation.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(7) Economies should have the confidence of servicing the external debt through export earnings.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(8) The financial sector especially banking should have strong balance sheets, mature, com­ petitive and have the depth to assess and mitigate risks. They should be following pruden­ tial lending, not overexposed and a balanced asset portfolio in terms of their risk appetite.</p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-</p> <p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(9) Economies should have initiated economic reforms, greater openness towards competitive, efficient, market-determined and productive domestic economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">What is the status of convertibility in India? India’s effort at convertibility has been cautious, well-calibrated, well thought out and gradual, beginning since 1994. It is not necessary to map the journey or the chronological ordering but that there has no fallouts</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">in the journey so far. The present status is thus ‘complete convertibility on the current account’ in the balance of payments of the India . But not capital account convertibility (CAC ). Convertibility on the current account implies that for export and import of goods and services, transactions in foreign currencies are unrestricted and do not have any restrictions either from the RBI or from the government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Restrictions on Current Account Transactions</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">With regard to other transactions on the current account they are also unrestricted except for the following which are restricted:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) Outward remittance of prize money earned out of game shows, lottery, betting, racing, etc., is not permitted.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) For outward tourism, an Indian resident can freely take up to USD 10,000 per visa holder in a calendar year should more be required prior authorization of RBI would be required.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) For education abroad and overseas medical treatment expenses up to USD 1,00,000 is unrestricted and beyond requires prior authorization from the RBI.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) All foreign currency payments made to foreign artists in India, and that required for cultural tours overseas require prior authorization of Ministry of Finance, Government of India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Apart from the above transactions, the remaining transactions in the current account are unrestricted. It needs to be understood and absence of convertibility does not imply that transactions cannot be done but such transactions require prior authorization from either the RBI or the government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Capital Account Convertibility (CAC)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">In the status on convertibility it was mentioned above that presently India does not have CAC. CAC has been driven in India based on recommendations of various experts committee from time-to-time, but the most notable has been the Tarapore Committee recommendations. The committee had given a road map of‘fuller’ convertibility which is easing of restrictions on the capital account but not complete removal of all restrictions on the capital account over a period of time. However, the committee has remained silent on the issue of‘full’ convertibility.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In terms of the recommendations made, the government has, however, gone ahead with the easing of restrictions on the capital account as under:</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">At present, all inflows in foreign currency, irrespective of the nature, are completely convertible. For example, ‘that there are no restrictions either by the government or RBI,</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">on any kind of inflows, or their reversal as outflows’. Then what kinds of outflows on the capital account arc restricted? Outflows arising out of conversion of rupees into foreign currency by Indian residents, Indian companies, Indian financial institutions for overseas transactions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Even here, recently, the government has considerably eased restrictions on such transactions on the capital account which are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) Indian residents can freely remit up to USD 2,00,000 in a financial year overseas without any restrictions, for any investment purpose. Except that it should not be remittance of prize money earned. However, in view of the recent rupee turbulence it has been brought down to USD 75,000.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) Indian residents can open foreign currency accounts in India for foreign currency earned for services rendered overseas. Such accounts are known as foreign currency Indian residents FC(IR) accounts.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Indian mutual fund managers can invest up to USD 5 billion in global stock markets.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) There has also been considerable relaxation to Indian companies to borrow overseas which are discussed in the next section.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">What do the  above  imply  that even without having  CAC,  rupee is virtually convertible except that it is not ‘formal’ declaration. This means that the government today has a choice of going back and can choose to re-impose restrictions on these kinds of transactions at any time.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Should the government then press the accelerator and go for full convertibility?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) At present, there are no apparent compulsions for the government to announce complete convertibility, as the purpose of attracting foreign inflows is being served especially in the last two years and India’s stature globally is not affected even without complete convertibility.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) Further, China has broken the myth of inflows linked to convertibility and that openness not possible without convertibility or that convertibility and global competitiveness go together.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -24pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Chinese economy is the fastest growing and expanding economy of the world, with robust exports, sitting on a trade surplus and globally competitive.</p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) China has seen sizeable inflows into their economies of over USD 500 billion in the last two decades and if Hong Kong is included it will go over USD 1 trillion, all without any convertibility.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) Definitely Chinese experience has diluted the importance and relevance of convertibility for open economies.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) Even India despite not having CAC, particularly after 2007, there has been sizeable inflows including foreign direct investment as can be seen in the section on Foreign Investment discussed subsequently.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) However, over a period of time with a more balanced global economy, from the present unbalanced, favouring Asian economies, convertibility would eventually be</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">seen as maturity, resilience of economies with strong macro-fundamentals allowing smooth integration within the global economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(8) Lack of convertibility also allows for leakages, conversion of good money into bad money, a hindrance to the increasing cross-border flows. As openness of economies increases it only raises transaction costs of conversion.</p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(9) India unlike China, fortunately has initiated the journey, but even with no apparent</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">compulsions of completing the journey, at some time would have to complete it</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">as the controls would become ineffective or outflows controls.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">finding way</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">around the</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: left;">(10) Full convertibility of the Indian rupee can be delayed, but is inevitable and the only issue is by when?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">EXTERNAL COMMERCIAL BORROWINGS</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">A major aspect of FEMA and trade reforms is also the easing of restrictions on the private corporate sector to borrow from the international market especially for paying for its imports and  saving on the transaction  cost of converting  rupees to  foreign  currency  for import of goods. This is known as external commercial borrowings (ECBs) which is similar to domestic borrowing except that they are in foreign currency from the overseas market.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It also allows the corporate sector to take advantage of the interest rate differential between the domestic and international rates of interest. A key aspect of interest rates on ECBs is that they are linked to London inter-bank offer rate (LIBOR) a market- determined rate of interest, at which global banks lend to each other and the floor level of interest and bench mark for global interest rates. The mark up over LIBOR is usually in ‘basis points (bps)’. A 100 bps mark up implies 1 per cent over the LIBOR.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Who decides the mark up for ECBs? The mark up is in terms of the sovereign rating of countries first and then the companies given by the international rating agencies such as Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor and Fitch. Normally a company’s raring cannot be better than the sovereign rating and it is invariably the country’s rating which decides the mark up. These rating agencies arrive at ratings of economies based on well-defined objective parameters. The ratings is in a scale comprising of two broad categories one—as ‘investment’ grade, economy has good fundamentals and can be considered as investment grade with minimum to moderate risk and the other—‘speculative’ grade which is, economy can be considered for investment but that the risk is high.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The higher up on the scale implies less risk and thus a lower mark up and the lower down the scale there is high risk and mark up accordingly is much higher. At present, the rating of India by the three rating agencies is a low of one notch above the last in investment grade which is, India is considered ‘marginally as investment grade’. Why such a low rank by international-rating agencies?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(1) First and foremost is because of the high fiscal deficit. The combined fiscal deficit of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">the center and states put together over 10 per cent. Such high levels are unsustainable in the long-run.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(2) High levels of public debt (all liabilities of Central and State Governments) to GDP ratio of over 70 per cent.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: left;">(3) Such high debts are trigger points of an internal crisis like it happened in Greece and Ireland.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(4) Near absence of fiscal consolidation.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(5) Slowing down of the reform process.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Even though the government has protested against the rating given to India, but these agencies are known for their independent and unbiased thinking. The most important aspect is that these ratings have global acceptability and the basis for deciding the mark up for ECBs besides also influencing overseas investment decisions.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">At present, RBI under FEMA has allowed companies to raise ECBs up to USD 750 million under the automatic route which is not requiring approval of RBI. All ECBs under automatic route or also subject to maturity period stipulated by RBI and have end use’ restrictions i.e., the purpose of ECBs has to be declared and it is to be ensured that the proceeds are used only for the declared end use by the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There is also a restriction that the proceeds have to be parked overseas and will not be allowed to be converted into rupees for bringing it back into the domestic economy. There is presently an overall country level ceiling of USD 35 billion for ECBs. The only issue with ECBs is that only reputed companies can access the ECB route. The amount raised</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">as ECBs are reflected in the external debt of the country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and Global Depository Receipts (GDRs)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">There is yer another route through which Indian corporate sector can raise foreign currency denominated funds which is through issuance of ADRs and GDRs. In the absencel of convertibility, Indian companies cannot access the global capital market by issuance of shares just as they can be in the domestic market. To enable companies to access global markets, companies can issue shares, but instead of selling in the overseas market directly can off-load the shares to an international depository.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This depository on the strength of underlying shares held by it in the capacity of a custodian, would issue depository receipts and sold, just like shares in the overseas market.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">These receipts are akin to a share, have similar features but are not shares as it does not confer voting rights to the holder of these receipts.

It was nor too long ago when foreign investment was treated with mistrust associated with the multinationals operating for self-interests with exploitative tendencies, a bitter fallout or the earlier colonial regime.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">It was China, a highly closed economy in the seventies, changed the notion of development by following liberal policies for attracting foreign investment as means to meet the investment needs and to accelerate growth of their economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">They showed that for development purposes money matters and not the ‘colour’ of the money. Also that foreign investment is not a necessary evil, as widely believed, by many economies. The transformation of the Chinese Economy to its present look can largely be attributed to foreign investment in their country.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">But what exactly is foreign investment? Foreign investment comprises of two components, one referred as foreign direct investment (FDI) and the other as investments by foreign institutional investors (FII) now referred as foreign portfolio investor (FPI). FDI represents overseas equity investment projects in India with the investment objective of directly managing businesses. The equity investment can be in an existing company or as a new company for various projects in the country. The objective is to do commercial business in the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The extent of  equity a foreign investor can bring  in  different  projects is  referred as ‘sectoral caps’ and prescribed by government through its various ‘press notes, issued by Department of Industrial Policy &amp; Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry’. Some aspects of FDI should be kept in mind, one is that they come  with a business orientation, with an explicit profit motive and they provide a unique blend of resources, technology, knowledge and professionalism and management techniques. Their interests are not short-term but long-term. A misconception of FDI is repatriation of profits or outflows from the country. As mentioned earlier, they operate with a commercial motive, but will not begin to earn profits immediately and it takes time to achieve break even by companies before they begin to earn profits. Even when they begin to earn profits</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">repatriation , is not of the entire profits but only a certain percentage of profits earned and that cannot be legitimate criticism of FDI.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Investment by FPls on the other hand, is predominantly in the stock markets with the purpose of solely trading in shares of companies, and also investment in corporate debt and government securities. Their objective is to book profits on investments made. Such investments are short-term and volatile and if millions of dollars can come in, they can</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">also go out overnight. They stay in the markets as long as things are good and the first one to leave in periods of uncertainty. They are referred as ‘fair weather friends’. Such investments are also known as portfolio investment’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part146.htm">FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI)</a><a class="toc0" href="part147.htm">26.3 FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT (FPI)</a><a class="toc0" href="part148.htm">INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF)</a><a class="toc0" href="part149.htm">27.2 THE WORLD BANK GROUP</a><a class="toc0" href="part150.htm">ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)</a><a class="toc0" href="part151.htm">27.4 NEW DEVELOPMENT BANK</a><a class="toc0" href="part152.htm">27.5.
