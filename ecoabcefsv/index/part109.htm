In exceptional years of wars and other such situations, India has also opted for annual plans. also known as ‘plan holiday’, a break from the five-year plans.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There was also a concept of rolling plan which also has a horizon of five years, bur allowing for corrections mid-term or even annually depending on the performance under various heads. However, primarily in India, it has been the five-year plans with each plar. having a mid-term review.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Planning in India is centralized, which provides a macro framework of developmental and investment needs, mobilization of resources to achieve desired levels of growth. The responsibility of planning in India vests with the Planning Commission which is not a statutory  body,  headed by  a Deputy Chairman  and  the Prime Minister as  the Chairman of Planning Commission. The plans are formulated by the Planning Commission and are approved by the National Development Council (NDC) with the Prime Minister as its Chairman.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Government of India, in keeping with its reform agenda, constituted the NITI Aayog to replace the Planning Commission instituted in 1950. This was done in order to better serve the needs and aspirations of the people of India. An important evolutionary change from the past, NITI Aayog acts as the quintessential platform of the Government of India to bring States to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters Cooperative Federalism.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The National Institution for Transforming India, also called NITI Aayog, was formed via a resolution of the Union Cabinet on January 1, 2015. NITI Aayog is the premier policy ‘Think Tank’ of the Government of India, providing both directional and policy inputs</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part108.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part110.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
