Direct taxes particularly income tax is progressive and in contrast to other taxes which are regressive in nature.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The progressivity of income taxes in periods of inflation pushes people up the tax</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">bracket, as pay packets get inflated due to inflation resulting in higher taxes paid and reduced spending by the individuals. On one hand, the coffers of the government fills up because of people moving up the tax bracket and on the other there is a reduced spending. This phenomenon is known as ‘Fiscal drag’.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">How many people do you think are tax payers in the economy?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">At present, 4.0 per cent are tax payers in the Indian economy, about 37 million in a population of over one billion people. This number is low especially considering the fact that India in its growing economy, with increased income, rising middle class, the affluent class and large number joining the elite billionaire club. In comparison, the number of tax payers has only increased by 11 per cent.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">What are the ways through which tax payers and tax revenue can be increased? There</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">could be three ways through which it can be increased and are as follows:</p><p class="s60" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">1) <span class="p">Increase in the direct tax rates.</span></p><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">2) <span class="p">Increase in the tax base.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3) <span class="p">Enforce tax compliance.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Increase in Tax Rate</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Any increase in tax rate is seen negatively and resented by the people. There is also a relationship between the direct tax rate and revenue generated. Starting from a low tax rate and gradually increasing it, is positively related and increases tax revenue. However, beyond a level, any increase in tax rates becomes counter-productive as it lowers tax revenue rather than in increasing it. This is popularly known as the ‘Laffer curve’.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">An economy being  on  the Laffer curve implies  that any increase in tax  rates  would lower the tax revenue and on the contrary lowering of tax rate would lead to increased revenue for the government. It is widely believed that India is on the Laffer curve with limited prospects of raising taxes.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This is because high tax rates lead to tax evasion, non-disclosure of income and generation of black money (taxes not paid). All efforts are made to minimize the incidence of taxes legally and illegally. It serves as a disincentive in the economy leading to lowering of income and the output. Hence, raising tax rates is not an option available in India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Increase in Tax Base</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Tax base refers to that threshold level of income on which taxes become applicable. India has an exemption level, that is, if income is less than ₹ 2.5 lakh per annum taxes are not</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">payable. So one way could be to lower the exemption level so that more people are drawn</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in the tax net and thereby an increase in tax payers and tax revenue.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">At present, the exemption level is very low given the present inflation. Besides the inflation does not factor in cost of education, transport and property prices all of which have increased manifold in recent times creating hardships and making it difficult for the middle class to make both the ends meet. Lowering the exemption would further burden the middle class and more so by this way it may be possible to increase the ‘number of tax payers’ but ‘not necessarily tax revenue’ as many would be marginal tax payers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other way to increase the tax base is to bring in untaxed sectors under the tax net. All sectors with the possible exception of the agricultural sector are already under the tax net. Agriculture being a state subject can be taxed only by the state government and not by the central government. Thus, like increasing tax rate, even increasing tax base is not a feasible option for raising direct tax revenue in India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ensuring Tax Compliance</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This is to ask the question that, is every person who ought to pay taxes is paying his/her taxes in terms of existing laws and the second are the people who are not paying should actually be paying taxes. This is what is meant by tax compliance. The government has made an initiation by making the income tax return form user friendly and easy to fill up by an individual and it is known as ‘Saral’.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 21pt;    text-align: justify;">The problem in India is that of tax compliance with lot of leakages, large-scale tax evasion and black money. It is estimated that over 40 per cent of GDP is black money which is circulating in the economy on which no taxes are paid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part81.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part83.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
