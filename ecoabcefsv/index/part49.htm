Post-independence India was deeply influenced by the Soviet Union which had state-run industries and was an era of‘socialism’ with large role of the government in production of goods and services. ‘Capitalism’ was associated with exploitative tendencies and having vested interest.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Immediately after Independence, the private sector was virtually non-existent in India and whatever existed did not have the maturity, resources, technology, etc., to shoulder could get the responsibility of the industrialization. The government, at its own level technology and other such support from other countries which may not have been possible otherwise.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Even if it is presumed that the task was entrusted to the then private sector, industrialization would have required huge resources, technology support and well-trained manpower, which were not available within the then private sector. Basic/capital goods industries have long gestation period (time between investment and commercial production), high break-even point (long period before profits accrue). These could be seen as natural dis-incentives for the private sector at that time.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Setting up public sector in India for industrialization was a conscious, well thought out and deliberate decision given the magnitude of responsibility and the need for moving on a pre-determined path of industrialization. The role of public sector in India was clearly cut-out and set up with the following objectives:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1. Create significant ‘capacities’ (ability to produce) in basic and capital goods.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. Achieve self-reliance in core areas and also facilitate import substitution.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4..</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">7.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">8.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Attain commanding heights of the economy and become a driver for the industrial growth and a catalyst’ in accelerating overall growth of the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Adopt pro-labour technology to create employment opportunities.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Setting up industries in backward/tribal areas for their integration with the rest of the economy and also for better regional development.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Provide for development of the private sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Set up self-contained townships covering residential, schools, hospitals, transport, etc. Public sector to have regulated prices by the government given their importance to the economy and not creating an upward spiral in the prices of basic goods.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Six decades since setting up of public sector, can it be said they have delivered or achieved</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the objectives?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -10pt;    text-align: left;">1. Broadly they have delivered in creating significant capacities ’ in all core areas and having achieved self-reliance in all kinds of industrial goods required in the economy .</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;    text-align: left;">2. Today , India can safely claim that it is not dependent on any country for its requirement of industrial goods largely due to the public sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. They have provided gainful employment.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -10pt;    text-align: left;">4. It has also facilitated evolution of the private sector and also been responsible for the levels of industrialization and industrial maturity reached.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -10pt;    text-align: left;">5. They can also be credited for making the industrial sector a driver of growth and lifting overall rates of growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">They have had their own set of issues too, but many of them cannot be directly attributed to them, issues of capacity utilization, technology-related, time and cost overruns but most importantly, many public sector enterprises are loss making. Of the two hundred twenty odd PSU one third are loss making with high levels of accumulated losses.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, can we really blame the public sector for being loss making? Public sector was set up with socio-welfare considerations provided the objectives of industrialization, self-reliance, employment generation, development of backward/tribal areas. More fundamentally, government ownership and profits do not go together. Profit is a function of pure businesses and public sector by virtue of government being the owner cannot function as a pure business.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Similarly, to comment on the efficiency levels of public sector is incorrect as efficiency levels can be envisioned amongst the comparables’. One can comment on who is more efficient amongst say, Pepsi and Coke. However, all public sectors are operating as monopolies in terms of their scale of operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Whom would you compare ONGC or BHEL or SAIL with? This is true for all public sectors. It is not to say that public sector is efficient. The expression conveyed here is that it is not possible to comment on efficiency levels of public sector based on efficiency levels of the private sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Further comparison of the public sector is technically incorrect as private sector operates as a commercial venture with an explicit profit motive unlike the public sector which also have social objectives to fulfill . Public sector has not to be envisioned from the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">perspective of profit-making or efficiency levels but in the larger context of the objectives which</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are assigned to them when they were set up.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">We would revisit public sector a bit later after developing an understanding of the industrial policies which have defined the role of public sector and also path of industrialization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part48.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part50.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
