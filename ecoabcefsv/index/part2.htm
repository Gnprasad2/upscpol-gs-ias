Surely, we would wonder about the parameter of such a—land area, population or output!</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In every economy, ‘goods’ are being produced, that is, raw materials are being converted into finished goods, agricultural crops, forestry, livestock, steel, cement, cars, cycles, bread etc. Similarly, services’ are also being rendered like banking, insurance, shipping etc. All of these have a monetary value in the local currency like the USD in the US and the INR in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, output per se implies aggregation of monetary value of all the goods and services produced in an economy in a given time period which may be a quarter (3 months), half- a-year (6 months) or a year (12 months).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In other words, output’ includes all goods and services exchanged for money. For example,  a fisherman catching fishes,  may  use some of it  for self-consumption  and the remaining may be used for selling in the market; thus, the monetary value of all the fishes would be considered under the concept of output.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It sounds simple so far, but delving a little deeper output may as well comprise of intermediate goods like steel and cement, which in turn are inputs for other goods referred to as ‘final goods’. These final goods cannot be put to further use, except for use like cars, buildings etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">If we were to include both the intermediate and final goods in our definition of output, then that would effectively mean counting the same thing twice and in the process inflate the output of an economy. For example, production of wheat and its milling as flour results in the making of bread; thus for output purposes, only the monetary value of bread would be considered and not that of wheat and flour. Therefore, we can conclusively derive that the output should have only final goods in order to avoid double counting.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">But, what about a sale of second hand goods like say a second hand car? Should they be reflected in the output of an economy? The answer is no, as they have already been included once when manufactured and therefore does not amount to a fresh production. Thus, output of an economy is the monetary value of the final goods and services in a given time period.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The production of goods and rendering of services are referred to as economic activities; but who are the producers of goods and services in an economy? They could either be individuals, small and petty businesses, private companies like the Tatas, Birlas, Reliance Industries etc., or even government like the public sector companies ONGC, SAIL etc., or even foreign companies like Nokia, Sony, Samsung etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">If we were to take the monetary value of all the final goods and services produced within the geographic boundary of a country, irrespective of who the producer of the goods and services are, then it is called ‘domestic output’ of the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, in the Indian context, domestic output consists of the monetary value of all final goods and services produced/rendered by individuals, private sector, public sector and foreign companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Having looked into who are the producers in an economy, let us look now at how the goods are produced. In order to produce goods, at first we need some place/infrastructure where the goods can be produced. Thus we would need to have a some land (or building); money as seed capital, in order to buy machines and raw material, invest in marketing, arrange for transportation etc.; labour for production and then a person whom we call the entrepreneur as the producer of goods. These are known as ‘factors of production’ in an economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, in  a ‘production life cycle’, each factor of production will  have an  associated cost—be it the seed capital for investment, rent for the place/infrastructure, or for that matter  the  labour  wages and  salaries; as  an entrepreneur,  the  profit  that an entrepreneur gains at the end of the day, is principally for the risk that he/she takes for production.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is important to note that profit is a cost for any economic activity; but then what is cost is also income for factors of production. For example, rent is an income for land, interest is the income for capital, wages and salaries are the income for workers and supervisors and profit per se is the income for the risks taken by the entrepreneur. Let us illustrate this example further with numbers. Following are the details of a manufacturing company:</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Land (rent)</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Labour (Wages &amp; Salaries) Capital (Interest) Entrepreneur (Profit)</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Total</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">₹ 10,000</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">₹ 1,000</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">₹ 750</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">₹ 500</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">₹ 12,250</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">In this example , the total cost (all costs included ) to an entrepreneur is ₹12,250 ; what is the output! It is the same amount as ₹12,250; and what is the income of all the factors of production!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">It is again the same as ₹12,250. This basically means that output /cost is income for factors of production. Thus, output and the income are two sides of the same coin. Whether we say output or income, it implies the same thing.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">At times, output is also referred as the product of an economy, (quantity multiplied by factor cost) thus domestic product and domestic income of an economy are the same.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">So far, we has discussed about the domestic output/product/income, but what about the income of Indians staying abroad? For a more comprehensive analysis of the output, it</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">.$ necessary to look beyond the geographic boundaries that would include the income of all the Indian nationals irrespective of the country they currently reside.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">But if we include the income of Indian nationals outside the country, it will also be logical to deduct the income of foreign nationals residing in our country. This is also referred to as Net Factor Income From Abroad (NFIAD). Thus,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Domestic Product + Income of Indians Abroad - Income of Foreigners in India =</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: center;">National Product or</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: center;">Domestic Product (+/-) NFIAD = National Product</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Net factor income from abroad can be positive or negative depending up on which is more— income of Indian nationals abroad or income of foreign nationals in India, that is, national product is less than the domestic product, if the income of Indian nationals abroad is less than the income of foreigners in India and vice versa.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">An increased foreign currency denominated debt of a country or selling domestic assets to foreign entities would tend to reduce the national product leaving domestic product unchanged.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part3.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
