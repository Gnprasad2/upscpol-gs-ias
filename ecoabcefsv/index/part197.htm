It would have to build better risk assessment capabilities, risk appetite and sufficiency of capital, in the Indian banking system, in the wake of the global financial fallout . The government has set up an apex level financial stability</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">development council (FSDC ) for addressing issues of financial stability , inter - regulatory coordination, financial literacy and financial inclusion.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Though this council is still  at a  nascent  stage  but  RBI  would be  required  to  play a major role with other regulators providing inputs. Its role should not be that of excessive</p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">regulations but  to  provide  a  domestic  oversight mechanism to financial and other sectors and a conduit to pass on global financial developments. RBI would also need to understand that while credit contraction or expansion by banks lies within its purview, it is not answerable for any deceleration in industrial growth, arising out of credit contraction.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This is what the council should do to provide the interface and not earn the status of a ‘super regulator&quot; in the economy. It should only be a platform for providing interface with other regulators of the economy. Neither should the council allow emergence of a super regulator in the economy. As a super regulatory would only make the other regulators in the economy meaningless and ineffective, defeating the very purpose of a regulator.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It should also have to take critical decisions especially in respect of exchange rates in determining the levels and timing of its intervention to manage exchange rates. Another aspect would be managing the capital inflows. We had previously discussed about the ‘impossible trinity’ of being able to manage any two, between exchange rate, open capital</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">account and an independent monetary policy. This would be the biggest challenge for the RBI in future.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Overall, the Indian Economy has a bright outlook, from all the angles, but still requires first, conversion of advantages as opportunities and then their encashment. It places great responsibilities on the shoulders of the government and RBI of leading from the front, and make India a front runner amongst the emerging economies in the future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part196.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part198.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
