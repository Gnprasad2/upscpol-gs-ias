Till 2016-17, Government defined broadly, there are two kinds of expenditure—one is plan expenditure, which is expenditure ear marked for investment in different areas , in the five -year plans for various sectors of the</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">economy . These could be either capital or revenue in nature . Capital expenditure represents creation of assets in an economy and is thus desirable for growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">For example, money spent for setting up power plant is a capital expenditure. Revenue expenditure is recurring in nature, for maintenance, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other is the non-plan expenditure which is an expenditure not covered in the five- year plan but yet has to be incurred and could again be either revenue or capital. In India, non-plan expenditure is 70 per cent of the total expenditure whereas plan expenditure is only 30 per cent. The highest expenditure is non-plan revenue expenditure accounting for 63 per cent of total expenditure.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What are the components of non-plan revenue expenditure? The first is the interest payments (servicing of the loans taken by the central government both internal and external) accounting for over 25 per cent of the total expenditure. Secondly, subsidies (food, fertilizers and retail petroleum goods). Thirdly establishment expenses of defense. Fourthly, loans to state govemments/UT, establishment expenses of central government, pension to defence/central government retired personnel. Expenditure on these heads would account for over 90 per cent of non-plan revenue expenditure. These expenses are also known as consumption of the government as no assets are created.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RECEIPTS BY THE GOVERNMENT</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The expenditure in an economy is met out of receipts by the government through various sources. The receipts could be revenue (which do not create any interest liability for the government, regularity in their receipts and not representing borrowings) and the other as capital (cither creating a liability for the government or less certain of their receipt or borrowings). Of the total receipts, 90 per cent is revenue and 10 per cent is capital receipts. The primary source of revenue receipts is tax revenue (84 per cent of total receipts). Taxes could be either direct or indirect.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">How to distinguish direct tax from indirect tax? Direct tax is a tax where the subject on whom the tax has been levied is identifiable, who has to pay the tax and the tax burden cannot be shifted. Examples can be income tax, corporate taxes, wealth tax, etc. In case if the subject is not identifiable or if the burden can be shifted it is an indirect tax. Common examples are excise duty (payable by companies on manufacturing activities), customs duty (duty on import of goods), service tax (tax on services being rendered by service providers), etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Fifty-five per cent of the tax revenue arrives through direct taxes while 45 per cent of the revenue is from indirect taxes. The base on which the tax is applied for indirect taxes could either be on value <i>(ad valorem) </i>or specific on a particular attribute (length of staples in cotton). India primarily follows an <i>ad valorem </i>indirect tax structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Certain taxes are levied by the central government and at the same time it is also collected by the central government (income tax, customs duty, excise duty and service tax), certain taxes levied by the central government bur collected by the state governments (central sales tax levied on inter-state movement of goods). A few other taxes are levied and collected by the respective state governments (sales rax, octroi, municipal taxes, road tax, entertainment tax and agriculture tax).</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The basis of sharing the rax revenue between the centres and the states are decided by the finance commission. The thirteenth finance commission under the chairmanship of Shri Vijay Kelkar has since submitted its report and is effective from 2010 to 2015.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There are two additional taxes—one is the surcharge which is imposed for additional revenue considerations by imposing an additional percentage on the absolute amount of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">tax payable. Suppose surcharge on a tax is 5 per cent and the tax payable is ₹100 then the total tax liability including surcharge would be ₹105.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The other is cess which is similar in application as the surcharge except that the amount</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">collected by way of cess is meant solely for specific funding/cause like education cess, the amount collected would go for funding of education only.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Components of revenue receipts other than taxes are dividends received by the government from public sector, payment of interest by the state governments etc. Similarly, capital receipts of the government comprises of recoveries of loan, grants, assistance received by the government etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part77.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part79.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
