The economy at present requires digging deeper into investment shifting from quantitative to qualitative’, from ‘traditional ro technology and knowledge intensive’ and from ‘capacity building to efficient capital investment’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Private Sector Investment</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Opening of the economy allowed for newer avenues of investment especially as private investment. This helped in raising the investment levels in the economy but with a difference, of investment earlier being in the public sector domain now to private sector investment. Post-reforms with larger role of private sector, a liberalized environment, allowed private sector to operate in a competitive environment and at same time with new windows of untapped opportunities, resulting in plough back of profits translating into increased investment. This led to ‘supplementary core investment’ and also a ‘diversified capital investment’ into newer areas. This model also differed from public sector investment which was more ‘capacity building investment’ to an efficient capital investment’. This contributes to leveraging of the core investment and diversification of the industrial base, capable of lifting the plain of growth, as happened in the case of India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Leveraged Investment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Another investment model being experimented in India, is the concept of public private sector partnership (PPP) which is being used for infrastructure projects. Such investment can be known as ‘leveraged investment’ (refer Chapter on Infrastructure Development). Briefly, this model seeks to take advantage of the strengths of both the government as well as the private sector for execution of various infrastructure projects and operations by the private sector for a limited period.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In recent times, there were a few question marks on this model, due to lack of transparency and ambiguities in the model concessionaire agreement (MCA) executed between the government and private players. There has to be a resolution mechanism for <i>inter-se </i>disputes arising from private parties and the government. The discontinuance Delhi metro airport express line is an example. Such instances can derail the model being</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">used in India. There is nothing wrong with the model if the areas of work, responsibility and accountability of both the private party and the government are clearly delineated and made integral part of the MCA.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Similarly, wherever ‘tolls’ are being levied there should be a complete display of the details of the project, toll levied, period of levy. Most tolls levied are not ‘rounded off resulting in the problem of‘change ’. For example , instead of toll being say ₹ 22 it could be</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">rounded up to ₹ 20. Similarly , toll of ₹ 18 can be altered to ₹ 20. There would be no loss of revenue to the concessionaire and this result in a lot of operational convenience also for the commuters and lesser waiting time at toll gates. The other alternative to this could be to retain the existing tolls and to introduce ‘smart cards’ which would allow for electronic auto debit through sensors installed at the toll gate.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other issue around levy of toll is that each toll gate is independent of the other resulting in the payment at multiple gates during the course of one journey. Understandably, this could be because of different concessionaire for different stretches of the same</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">journey . What is being suggested is, for example , traveling from Delhi to Chandigarh , is it possible to pay the entire toll at the first gate itself rather than at five different gates of the journey. The concessionaires could have a technology -enabled toll sharing mechanism . This</p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">would reduce waiting time at toll gates and effective use of the created infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Yet another variant to the existing PPP model be bringing and additional ‘P’ standing for ‘People’. In this variant, a representative body of people gets involved in the project right from the conception stage to the project building, monitoring progress thereof and also maintenance once the project is completed. This PPPP model can be used for people centric investment especially in social sector programs. It could be the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) under primary health care, rural electrification, rural roads, minor irrigation projects, etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Foreign Direct Investment</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">As a result of opening up of the economy, this has allowed for inflow of foreign capital both as foreign direct investment (FDI) and also foreign portfolio investment (FPI). The government only recently as clubbed all categories of FII investment as FPI. The investment model now being talked about is FDI which is ‘direct interest of a foreign investor in production or rendering of services’ (having control of over 51 per cent shares). It can also be indirect if the foreign investor has a control of minimum 26 per cent shares which would give it ‘management control’ (ability to ‘influence’ production, rendering of services bur not able to ‘directly run’ the business).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This model goes beyond the domestic savings and is envisioned as a supplement to domestic investment. This allows for scalability&#39; of investment even beyond the savings of an economy and the model used by China for increasing die overall investment and becoming the fastest growing economy of the world. It has redefined the boundaries of investment.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Various forms of FDI in India could be the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1) Wholly owned subsidiary (WOS).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(2) Wholly owned company incorporated in India (WOC).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Joint venture (JV) company incorporated in India (JV with an Indian partner with management control or controlling share of 51 per cent to directly manage the business).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(4) JV into an existing line of business with management control.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">All options are open in India. The government from time-to-time notifies FDI caps for different sectors of 26 per cent, 49 per cent, 51 per cent and 74 per cent and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;    text-align: justify;">100 per cent. The  government is considering increasing sectoral  caps  in many  areas to attract more FDI into India. Changes in the sectoral caps are notified by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) under Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">FDI has two distinct advantages—one of augmenting domestic investment and the other helps in meeting current account deficit (CAD). For detailed elaboration, refer to sections on foreign investment and balance of payments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sector Specific Investment</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Another investment model being used in India is setting up of special economic zones (SEZs ) to attract investment for increasing exports from India (refer to Chapter on Export Orientation ). This investment adopted by China in seventies has been responsible for China</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">emerging as the largest exporter of manufactured goods, a position enjoyed by US in the past.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Such investment can be known as ‘sector specific investment models’.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Another example of sector specific investment model is setting up of National Manufacturing Investment Zones (NMIZs) which will be integrated in industrial townships. It will co-locate productions units, logistics, public utilities and residential and green environment. The prime objective is to increase the share of manufacturing sector output to around 25 per cent as a percent of GDP over the next decade. This model also aims to double employment in the manufacturing sector in the same period. Tax and other fiscal benefits as applicable to SEZs would also be applicable to NMIZ. They are now referred as Integrated Manufacturing Clusters (IMC).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Venture Capital</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Venture capital is form of financing through which the investors provide capitals to startup companies and small businesses. This capital generally comes from well-off investors, investment banks and any other financial institutions. Sometimes it takes in the form of technical or managerial expertise as well.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cluster Investment</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">While sector specific investment can be multi-dimensional, cover different industry groups, cluster investment can be there to promote specific set of industries, such as handlooms, leather, garments, brassware, electronic goods, etc. These clusters comprises of small-scale industries which enjoy certain benefits of location, of proximity to raw material, markets, availability of skills and infrastructure. These clusters are promoted by the government.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part66.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part68.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
