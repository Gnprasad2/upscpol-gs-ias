While growth is an arithmetic number signifying an increase in the output of an economy, development includes distribution of output or the ability of the increased output and income to reach the bottom-most stratum of society. Development also implies equitable distribution in the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Earlier it was widely believed that initially increased growth is required and then development would happen, through what is referred as the ‘trickle-down theory’. This means that the increased growth would percolate down to the bottom-most stratum of society and provide equitable distribution. This is the significance of the word ‘growth and development’.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the earlier years, the problem was our inability to push up rates of growth and the emphasis was on increasing growth for the trickle-down theory to work which would have allowed for development and equitable distribution. But the story for India is quite different since the economic reforms initiated in 1991 and since 2005. India has not only broken through the low-growth cycle but also become one of the fastest-growing economies after China.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The high growth rate achieved since 2005 questions the trickle-down theory in India, as it has not benefited the Indian masses in terms of lowering absolute poverty levels significantly, creating employment opportunities, reducing inter-/intra-regional imbalances (rather it has only accentuated). There are reasons to understand why ‘trickle- down theory’ has not worked for India. Firstly, the Indian economy has a structural problem of excessive economic dependence on the agricultural sector. Over 65 per cent of the population is either directly/indirectly dependent on this sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The contribution of the agricultural sector to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) is only 18 per cent. The largest contribution of over 55 per cent comes from the services sector and the remaining 27 per cent is contributed by the secondary sector of which only 14 per cent is by the manufacturing sector. The sector contributing the least to GDP has the maximum dependence (agriculture) and the sector contributing the most, has the least dependence (services).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Secondly, In India’s growth process, there has been a missing link of the relative earlier maturity of the services sector before achieving manufacturing sector maturity. Ideally,</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">it should be first manufacturing sector before the services sector or at best together. This is an important feature as there is a linkage between manufacturing sector and agricultural sector either through raw materials or as a market for the industrial produce, and also for employment opportunities. This provides for greater sustainable growth of economies.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, the benefit of increased growth in recent years has largely been confined to die services sector and little to the manufacturing sector and has not percolated to the agricultural sector where the majority of our population resides.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The peaking or maturity of the service sector in India could be due to the surge in BPOs and KPOs and also due to the need for value-added services by the bigger economies establishing bases in India given the low cost of hiring, easier to impart skills and a large young workforce. Still, a larger question of why this excessive dependence on agricultural sector, remains still to be resolved. It is said that India’s population mostly resides in villages. Lack of employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector, lack of formal education/skills, lesser growth of agro-based industries, traditional thinking and abject poverty could be some of the many reasons.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">But it also has to do with the governmental efforts by providing basic, effective and efficient infrastructure around villages including the road/rail links. The aim should be to have pan-India rail-road connectivity. This would provide for easy accessibility and faster mode of travel the making labour mobile.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">History has been testimony to the fact that roads are the gateways to development in countries like Germany, the United States and more recently China. India has only recently woken up to this reality and due emphasis is now being given to the road building, primarily through various projects, namely, Golden Quadrilateral (connecting the 4 metropolitan cities Delhi-Kolkatta-Chennai-Mumbai), the North-South corridor (Srinagar-Kanyakumari) and the East-West corridor (Silchar-Porbandar).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Besides, efforts are also on for building of roads for Tier II and III cities and also for villages under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) scheme.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Recently, the government has cleared Bharatmala Project, which is the second largest highways construction project in the country since NHDP, under which almost 50,000 km or highway roads were targeted across the country. Bharatmala will look to improve connectivity particularly on economic corridors, border areas and far flung areas with an aim of quicker movement of cargo and boosting exports.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The project is expected to create nearly 100 million man days of jobs during the road construction and subsequently 22 million jobs as a result of the increased economic activity across the country. The construction will be billed via several routes including debt funds, budgetary allocation, private investment, toll operator transfer model etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The government, having realized that benefits of increased growth has not been reaching the people and hence now discontinued using nomenclature of ‘development’ and has replaced it by the term ‘inclusive growth’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 206pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Recommendations for Inclusive Growth in India</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;">1</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: center;">Improving Business</p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: center;">Environment</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Adopt revised Company Bills</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Implement Foreign Bribery Law</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Adopt National Competition Policy</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">• Improve Role of Competition Commission of India</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">• Introduce Cross Government Training</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Programme</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part8.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part10.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
