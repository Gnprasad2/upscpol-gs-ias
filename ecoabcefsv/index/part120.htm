No one country can be said to have the best of everything in the world i.c., there is a <i>&#39;relative deficit&#39; </i>in each country which could either be resources, or people, or knowledge or technology or markets or even goods and services differing in terms of their range and superiority.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The needs of a country keep on changing continuously . It also undergoes a change with increasing population pressure and increased income levels , requiring optimal and efficient allocation and utilization of scarce resources depending on the resource endowments of different countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Basically, there are two different kinds of resource endowments in an economy—labour and capital, This is <i>&#39;relative resource endowment&#39; </i>i.e., though every country will have both but relatively one would be more than the other across countries. India, for example, has relatively large and abundant pool of labour than capital. Similarly Germany has relatively more capital than labour. Thus, labour would be cheap in India, whereas capital would be cheap in Germany.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, production process in India would be labour-intensive and such goods would be cheaper in India. What about labour-intensive goods in Germany? They will be more expensive given their relative scarcity and higher cost of labour in comparison with India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">What about capital-intensive goods? The same, it will be cheaper to produce capital- intensive goods in Germany given their relative abundance of capital than India where capital is scarce.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, India producing capital-intensive goods and Germany producing labour-intensive goods is not efficient utilization of resources, sub-optimal and resulting in higher cost in both economies. Thus, the need arises for trade and to look outwards for an economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">A better solution for both the countries, India as well as Germany would be that: le: India produce labour-intensive goods  (as  it is relatively cheaper in India) and export to Germany while import capital-intensive goods from Germany (as it is relatively cheaper in Germany).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">This is what is known as <i>Theory of Comparative Advantage, which states that a labour- intensive country will export goods over which it has a comparative advantage (labour-intensive goods by India) and import goods over which it has a comparative disadvantage (capital- intensive goods from Germany).</i></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The relative differences in resource endowments then become the basis of trade for efficient allocation and utilization of resources resulting in <i>economic gains </i>for trading countries. Thus, no trading will only lead to growing inefficiencies, high costs, burden of inflation besides lop-sided development. Trading solely will allow for better addressing the needs of development, through efficient allocation of resources, reducing costs, increasing income of economies which is also known as welfare gains’ for both the countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As long as, an economy is looking at quantities of what is being produced, focused on creating capacities, meeting the <i>basic needs </i>of its population and the economy and issues such as <i>efficiency, quality </i>not on priority a country can afford to ignore trade. However, not indefinitely, as costs would gradually build-up, making economies high cost, uncompetitive given the high levels of inefficiency and chinks in the economy would start to appear of a high-cost, caught in a low-growth cycle, economy unable to meet the demands of growing population and the needs of higher growth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part119.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part121.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
