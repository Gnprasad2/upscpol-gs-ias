They also play a pivotal role in accelerating the development of regions/economies. As an open economy, neglect of ports can solely be at the expense of development of such economies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India’s fact sheet of ports consists of twelve major ports (two additionally approved— one in West Bengal and the second at Andhra Pradesh) and two hundred odd minor ports accounting for 95 per cent of cargo movement by volume and 70 per cent by value. The present port capacity is around 1000 million tonnes (MT).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Imports of crude petroleum, iron ore, coal and other essential commodities are all through the sea route. Realizing the importance of developing our ports to handle large volumes and increase cargo movement, the government has allowed 100 per cent private sector and 100 per cent FDI participation in this sector. Further, a ‘Maritime Agenda 2010-2020’, a perspective plan has been prepared which has set the goals as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) To increase India’s share in global ship building to 5 per cent from the present 1 per cent.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) To increase the share of Indian seafarers from 6-7 per cent to at least 9 per cent in the global shipping industry during 2015.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) To create a port capacity of around 3200 MT to handle the expected traffic of about 2500 MT during 2020.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) To bring ports at par with the best international ports in terms of performance and capacity.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) To increase the tonnage under the Indian flag and Indian control and also the share of Indian ships in our exim trade.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) To promote coastal shipping as it will help in decongesting our roads and is environment-friendly.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) In order to promote private participation and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country, the Government of India has allowed 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route for:</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• Captive facilities for port-based industries.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• Leasing of equipment for port handling and leasing of floating crafts.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• Leasing of existing assets of ports.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">• Construction/creation and maintenance of assets such as-container terminals bulk/break bulk/multi-purpose and specialized cargo berths, warehousing, container freight stations, storage facilities and tank farms, handling equipment, setting up of captive power plants, dry docking and ship repair facilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">As way of incentive, 100 per cent exemption from income tax is also extended to companies that are investing in port infrastructure. Further, a ten-year tax holiday has been given to enterprises which are engaged in the business of developing, maintaining and operating ports, inland waterways and inland ports.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">India’s shipping ministry is considering in removing the tariff fixing for major ports,</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">passing responsibility for this to the ports themselves. Instead, a new regulator for the sector will be appointed who will be responsible for setting, monitoring and regulating service levels as well as technical and performance standards. The ministry has also decided that all new major ports would be constructed through a corporate structure and will be registered under the Companies Act 1956.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recent Government Initiatives</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Contract to develop the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trusts (JNPT) container terminal at Navi Mumbai has been awarded to a Dubai-based company at a total cost of ₹600 crores (USS 100.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">20 million ). Gail India and the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI ) have signed a</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">memorandum of understanding (MoU) to cooperate for transportation of liquefied natural gas LNG sourced by Gail from the United States (US).</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The government has approved the project for upgradation of an existing facility and</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the creation of a new facility at Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) for iron ore handling in two phases on design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis with an investment of₹845.41 crores (USS 153.95 million).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Three major projects , with an investment of ₹ 1800 crores (USS 330.08 million ), are being taken up by the VPT. The Union Shipping Ministry has started working on some of its plans such as corporatization of major port trusts. Mumbai’s JNPT will be the first port to be corporatized . There are 14,500 km of navigable and potentially navigable inland waterways in the country of which the following five inland waterways have been declared as National Waterways and the details are listed below.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• National Waterway-<span class="p">1—Allahabad-Haldia stretch of the Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river (Total length 1620 km) in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• National Waterway-2—<span class="p">Sadiya-Dhubri stretch of the Brahmaputra river (Total length 891 km) in the state of Assam.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• National Waterway-3—<span class="p">Kollam-Kottapuram stretch of West Coast Canal and Champakara and Udyogmandal canals (Total length 205 km) in the state of Kerala.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• National Waterway-4: <span class="p">(Total length 1027 km) in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">• National Waterway-<span class="p">5: (Total length 588 km) in the states of West Bengal and Orissa.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• National Waterway 6: <span class="p">National Waterway 6 is the proposed waterway which connects Assam with Mizoram on the river Barak. The 121 km long waterway will help in trading between town of Silchar to Mizoram State.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The government has approved projects for development of multi-purpose  berths  as well as merchandised berths with allied facilities on DBFOT (design-build-finance-operate- transfcr) basis at Haldia Dock II  (North) for a  period  of  30 years  at  an estimated  cost</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">of ₹821.40 crores (USS 151.39 million) and at Haldia Dock II (South) for a period of 30 years at an estimated cost of ^886.10 crores (US$ 163.32 million). The projects will enable Kolkata Port Trust to enhance its capacity by 23.4 million tonnes per annum (MTPA ) and meet the demand for coal and other bulk cargo in the hinterland of Kolkata Port.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The government has also approved licensing of land to the concessionaires for seven</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">projects which are taken up in the PPP mode. These projects have been taken up in terms of the extant policy of the Government of India to pursue maritime development projects under the PPP mode. This will lead to efficiency in operations at major ports which will benefit trade and the economy as a whole.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Government has recently approved incentives to promote domestic shipbuilding industry. These include (i) financial assistance to domestic shipyards for any vessel built by them subsequent to its delivery and (ii) relaxation of eligibility criteria for procurements or repair of vessels done by Government departments or agencies including PSUs for government purpose or for their own purpose to grant Right of First Refusal to domestic shipyards.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Special Purpose Vehicle to provide efficient last mile rail connectivity to Major Ports with equity from 11 Major Ports and Rail Vikas Nigam has been incorporated under the Companies Act. This SPV ‘The Indian Port Rail Corporation Limited’ started functioning from July 2015 and since then has taken up 23 projects which are critical for last mile rail connectivity to the Major Pons.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Ministry of Shipping, along with the Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL) has drawn up an ambitious programme to develop 78 lighthouses in the country as centres of tourism in the first phase under Public Private Partnership (PPP). The identified lighthouses are in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Emphasizing that waterways would be a game changer for the economy, Shipping Ministry has sought enhanced budgetary allocation from the Finance Minister for the sector as despite being crucial to economy the Ministry has a paltry budgetary allocation of Rs 900 crore.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The ministry also urged the government to cut logistics cost in the country and streamline the taxation structure, including the implementation of the crucial goods &amp; services tax (GST) in the upcoming budget, to give a much-needed boost to the shipping industry.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">The money granted by Union Budget should be of the amount facilitating grant of industry’ status to the sea logistics sector in India to enable coordination among various industries for integrated policy development. Further, the government should grant ‘infrastructure’ status to the port and shipping industry so that it would reduce costs</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -2pt;    text-align: left;">to buy technologically advanced and environment friendly ships and fleets, and create a Logistics Modernisation Fund’ for the growth of the sector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Larger Issues of Ports in India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the recent efforts of the government in augmenting capacities in ports in India there are certain critical issues which need to be resolved. They are as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Development of port infrastructure in India is not on par with the other ports across the world. Trade in India has to face severe challenges due to inefficient port services. Shipping lines avoid touching ports in India because of the long waiting time. The capacity of various ports including Mumbai has already been exhausted and now capacities of other ports such as JNPT are on the verge of exhaustion.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Port development has to seen in a holistic and comprehensive manner and not in isolation. They have to emerge as integrated transport centers as logistics platform covering links to the hinter land with the rail road network. There has to be complementarities between rail, road and ports, seen as one and not separately.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Indian ports are not equipped to handle large containers as a result ships are re-routed and parked at other larger ports and cargos are loaded in smaller vessels to facilitate their entry/exit out of the country. This raises costs and also transit time. India is heavily dependent on Colombo as a transshipment hub which has both economic as well as political implications.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India also needs 24 x 7 custom cargo clearance facilities besides excessive paperwork and documentation requirement solely increase transaction cost. Average turn-around time of vessels of 3.5 days is very high compared to the international standards which are only in hours and not in days. This is a critical factor which delays consignments making them uncertain, unreliable and uncompetitive in comparison to other ports.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Indian ports also have a high through put and transport cost because of an inefficient, unorganized  and un-coordinated  truck  movement which not only increase costs but also takes more time. It is also subject to frequent labor unrests, which disrupts loading and un-loading at ports.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Efforts at development of ports in India is only a recent phenomenon, however, more than development is to develop them with the future in view and how India can be made a hub for cargo movement. Rapid increasing trade will only add more and more pressure on the already created capacities which need to be augmented on a war footing.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sagarmala Programme</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This initiative is a series of projects to leverage coastline and inland waterways to drive industrial development. The Project was originally mooted in 2003 as the waterways equivalent of the Golden Quadrilateral. This Project is expected to reduce cost and time for transporting goods, thereby benefiting industries and export and import.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The project includes modernization of port infrastructure, improve port connectivity through rail corridors, freight-friendly expressways and inland waterways, create coastal economic zones and development of skills of fishermen and other coastal and island communities. Sagarmala project is expected to boost India’s merchandise exports to $110 billion by 2025 and create an estimated 10 million new jobs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">E-governance Initiatives</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following services have now been made online -</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Registration of ships</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Application and seat booking for written and oral examinations</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: left;">• Application and processing of Continuous Discharge Certificates (CDCs), renewal and replacement/duplicate CDCs</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Application processing and issuance of Certificate of Competencies (CoCs), dangerous cargo, GMDSS and Cookery certificates</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">• Application, processing and issuance of chartering permission</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Issue of registration certificate to transport operators</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Master checker for seafarers</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite being cleaner and cheaper mode of transportation, so far waterways development has remained on the backseat but government has taken a slew of steps to promote it. Though, outlook for the shipping sector looks subdued for short term, but it will turn out to be fruitful in long term as government is taking several initiatives like Sagarmala Project and Jal Marg Vikas Project. Moreover, approval for incentives to promote domestic shipbuilding industry and developing 78 lighthouses as tourism centers will provide some boost to the sector. On the concern side, the performance of dry bulk and container operators will continue to be affected by weak global trade growth and persistent overcapacity. Nevertheless, the tankers segment, which accounts for a majority of the Indian fleet, had a dream run in 2015-16 with more than double daily rates for each asset class. The segment will remain an exception due to its better demand-supply situation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part61.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part63.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
