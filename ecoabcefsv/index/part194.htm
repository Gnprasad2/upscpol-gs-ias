India’s agenda on the so-called big bang economic reforms were listed and discussed across forums from day 1 of the Modi-government. These were categorized as GST, land acquisition, labour, banking, investment liberalization and subsidy reforms.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">During last two years the government is right on track of reforms front not through big bang reforms, but several small, baby-steps. Most notably, the government has set economic wheel in motion by kicking off the process in the area of subsidy reforms. It has done so by promoting Aadhaar-bank account linkage for the roll out of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The LPG subsidy roll our through DBT was indeed a great move by this government to curtail leakage and diversion of government funds—something that</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">distorted the system for long.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the next three years, the government should enhance the reform task to food, fertilizer and other government benefits to the poor. The passage of Aadhaar Bill is a great enabler. The whole subsidy reforms process, which was first kicked off by the UPA-regime, is built on the DBT channel, based on the unique identity number, or Aadhaar card</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">provided to each citizen. It holds particular importance for the current government, and</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the success of its financial inclusion push under the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile) trinity. With 99.21 crore Aadhaar cards already been issued to almost 97 percent of the country’s adult population, taking ahead the subsidy reforms process using this channel is a logical step for India.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Liberalization of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms and ‘Modi shows’ in numerous foreign trips, have led to the spike in inward fund flows. The FDI inflows has grown by 29% to USD 40 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2016. But, the absence of revival in private investment cycle is still acting as a drag on the economy on multiple fronts. New projects are yet to happen in a major way and the existing stock of stalled projects continues to be a pain.. The chunk of stalled projects has gone up to Rs 11.4 lakh crore in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The absence of fresh private investments becomes even a greater problem seen in the backdrop of bank funding drying up to industries. Huge NPAs on bank balance sheets have forced banks to shut funding channels . Also, severe capital scarcity in the case of stare-run banks has further constrained banks’ ability to fund the economic growth. Thus the big task by government would be to convince the private investors to finance India’s infrastructure projects something essential to fire up an aspiring economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">When it comes to banking sector reforms, the passage of the bankruptcy law is a major step in the process of overhauling the country’s Rs 101 lakh crorc banking sector, even though implementation is key. Bankruptcy code passage also helped the UPA government to break the reforms jinx in successive parliament sessions battered by controversies and political blame games.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The reforms task is half-done yet. If the ongoing spike in bank NPAs continue for another few quarters, state-run banks will face a crisis situation if the government fails to bail out these entities. Averting a banking sector crisis will be one of the key tasks that will be used to judge the finished agenda in economic reforms. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) beginning the clean-up exercise has shown the actual depth of the trouble on the books of Indian banks (hidden bad loans), especially state-run lenders.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the March-quarter, PSU banks have reported record level of bad Ioans resulting in cumulative losses of over Rs 14,000 crore in the quarter. While the clean-up exercise should be done sooner than later. A crisis in the banking sector can upset the calculations. In the long-term, the biggest reform banking sector need is privatisation since government cannot keep on feeding banks. So, it is high time now to undertake radical reform measures in the banking industry.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The issue of land reforms is more or less off the table now. Since land acquisition is more or less is a state-specific affair now, there isn’t much the central government can do about.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The government has taken up a catalytic reform agenda across multiple domains since assuming charge whether it is legislative as in the Bankruptcy Act, procedural as in direct benefits transfer, or systemic like transparent auction of resources. The power sector reforms for coal supply, financial health of discoms under the UDAY scheme and bold innovative GST as biggest tax reform, thereby fulfilled the promise to significantly push up the GDP by 1.5%-2% going ahead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 137pt;text-indent: -33pt;    text-align: justify;">INDIAN ECONOMY­ OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHAPTER</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">41</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This is the concluding section, addressing the outlook for the Indian Economy after discussing at all the facets and perspectives of the domestic economy, the world economy and the economic reforms. The outlook would also have its own set of challenges which would have to be overcome.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part193.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part195.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
