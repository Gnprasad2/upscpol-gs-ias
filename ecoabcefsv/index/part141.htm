The concept of CAS is explained briefly.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">CAS typically represents surplus of  outflows over inflows and where this surplus is going? It represents ‘idle’ money as it reaches the RBI instead of the economy. It is idle because it has not been absorbed in the economy, which is possible in an over-invested economy or economics with little investment opportunities. Any further investment in such economies, would not increase growth but only fuel inflation. Such economies need to cool. A CAS is helpful for them. It could also be if the government interferes in their absorption through policy interventions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">So a CAS in China is understandable as it needs to slowdown to prevent build-up of inflationary pressures in the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India is already running a high CAD, but then these are abnormal circumstances of shocks of global recession. It is also because of import of crude petroleum and in recent rimes a surge in import of gold. Despite the high levels of CAD it can be said to be manageable given the surplus on the capital account. However, the same levels can overnight become very disturbing and dangerous should the capital flows reverse, leaving no choice, other than borrowings to meet the deficit on the current account.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Rightfully, the RBI while maintaining the BOP keeps a close watch on the movements both on the current account as well as capital inflows. High CADs in relation to their GDP has been a common denominator for all the crises-ridden economies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is wrongly believed that openness has been responsible, rather it was the inability of these economies to see the widening CAD, plunging them into the gorge of crisis. It should also be kept in mind that ‘it is not CAD <i>per se </i>which is the problem, but the way CAD is meet,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">whether irreversible capital flows, reversible flow&#39;s or borrowings ’. Only if CAD is being met</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">out of borrowing by a government can it be said to be a crisis or an unsustainable CAD. As long CAD is met out inflows on the capital account, other than borrowings which is through foreign investment, NRI deposits, it can be said to be manageable, not a serious cause of concern. Crisis on the current account is also known as ‘BOP crisis’.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part140.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part142.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
