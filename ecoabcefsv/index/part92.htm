(Basel is a place in Switzerland where BCFC prescribed norms applicable to all banks across countries and thus known as Basel norms). Capital adequacy implies that any bank, being engaged in a business of lending has normal risks’ associated and should have some minimum own funds to meet such risks.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Capital of banks being defined as the banks own capital and reserves as the core capital (Tier I) and also a component of supplementary capital (Tier II) is available to banks but less readily, like the revaluation of its assets (taken at a discount), provisions held for standard assets and long-term bonds raised by the bank (sub-ordinated debt).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Banks are today required to have their own capital in terms of shareholders funds, retained profits (deposits in banks are not bank’s own but public money). The condition</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">was that Tier II capital could not be more than 100 per cent of Tier I capital and that subordinated debt under Tier II capital not to exceed 50 per cent of Tier I capital.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The assets portfolio of a bank were weighted by the risk element, prescribed by central banks in the respective countries and aggregated, and a minimum 8 per cent of capital prescribed as the capital adequacy measure or Basel I norms. Which is, if a bank has risk</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">weighted assets of ₹100 then it should be having at least as capital (Tier I and II), to comply with the Basel I norms.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Reserve Bank of India for Indian Banks, as a part of the financial sector reforms gave a time frame to Indian banks to become the Basel compliant. Subsequently, the norm was raised to 9 per cent and continues to be the same presently in India. Basel II norms further refined the concept of measurement of risk and also brought in concept of operational risk, which are not covered as part of the Basel I norms and retaining the ratio as 8 per cent. All Indian banks are both Basel I and II compliant.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Post-global crisis the ratio has been further increased implying greater capacity need for banks to ensure that such global financial sector crisis does not recur in future. Capital adequacy thus has allowed for financial regulations to become global. It also allows any investor or a depositor to know the fundamental strength of banks and take their own informed decisions based on the capital adequacy levels of different banks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part91.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part93.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
