There is a need to make land records accessible and understood by the common man living in the villages.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is unfortunate that the system of land administration and management, despite its long history in India, has remained neglected in most parts of the country particularly after development agenda became the major focus of the government and administration in the recent few decades. The regular survey and the settlement operations started after the independence were abandoned, under a mistaken notion, that this whole exercise aimed at periodical revision of the land revenue, which had no place in a democratic polity, particularly because there were other major sources of revenue.</p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It was little realized, that proper and scientifically updated land records, are not only critical for agricultural development, but also are the backbone of developmental effort. Manual updating and physical verification of land records before their computerization is a must. There should be a National Authority for Computerization of Land Records (NACLR) at the Government of India level. In most states, the work is being handled by</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the Directorate of Land Records and Surveys who are not able to cope up with the task on account of their multiple responsibilities and this acquires low priority. There is thus a need that at the state level, there should be a dedicated institution in the form of the State Authority for Computerization of Land Records (SACLR) similar to the NACLR to exclusively deal with the computerization of land records . Both should work in tandem and complete the process in a time-bound period.</p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Such digital land records would be useful in creating a national portal of land records and furthering land reforms being attempted since Independence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part41.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part43.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
