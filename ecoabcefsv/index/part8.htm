The phrase basically means that the output of an economy is increasing but at a decreasing rate over the previous quarter/half-year/year, whichever is the reference period. If during the same reference period, output has declined, then it is referred to as contraction’ of output. Continuous periods of contraction over two quarters are known as ‘recession’ and still longer periods of continuous recession are known as ‘depression’.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Until now, the world economy has witnessed The Great Depression during 1929- 1933. (We shall discuss more about this aspect in the Chapter on Global Outlook.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As we have discussed earlier, growth plays an important role in an economy. As we know by now that ‘increased growth’ means ‘increased output’ and ‘increased income’ of an economy with increased income for factors of production which sets off a circular motion of further increase in income.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Increased Income —&gt; Increased purchasing power —&gt; Increased demand for goods and services —&gt; Increased production —&gt; Increased output —&gt; Increased income</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Increased income Increased savings —&gt; Increased investment —&gt; Increased output —&gt; Increased income</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, increasing growth of an economy signifies well-being of that economy. Jobs get created, income levels increase and overall wealth of an economy increases. For this very reason, every economy would like to increase its overall growth. India was believed till the reforms were initiated, caught in a ‘low-growth cycle’ with low levels of incomes, thereby resulting in low savings and thus low investments, ultimately again leading to low income and again to low savings, which is known as the low-growth cycle.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It was also said during those days that India is unable to break through the ‘Hindu rate of growth’ with its inability to grow beyond 3.5 per cent (the term was coined by the noted Indian economist, late Prof. Raj Krishna), with low income and increasing population leading to increased poverty and unemployment in the country, regional/intra-regional imbalances and also widening of income inequalities.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Inability of an economy to increase growth rates of economies is not only due to low savings and investment but also due to lack of  resources, technology and infrastructure constraints. These factors were a handicap earlier for India but things have changed in the 21st century.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The 21st century has been good for India, as growth rates had started moving upwards and on were on the verge of achieving a double-digit growth, probably for the first time, except may be for a year briefly in the 1980s. Though growth rates have increased but it has not made any perceptible impact on the poverty, unemployment, inter-/intra-regional and income imbalances. Despite the high growth rates achieved, we have not got the desired results. There has been a distinct deceleration in growth since 2010 sliding down to the lowest in last decade of 4.4 per cent. But the larger question remains of high growth achieved had not yielded tangible benefits to the Indian economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This would lead us to another concept of ‘development’. How are growth and development different from each other?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part7.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part9.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
