The other is the Industrial</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Policy of 1991 which is hailed as the usherer of economic reforms in India. It may not be required to go into each and every industrial policy since 1948, however, it would be suffice to see the salient key features of all policies pre-1991 which would facilitate a better understanding of the Industrial Policy of 1991 and the changes brought about in the right context.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Industrial Policies (pre-1991) are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) The industrial sector was highly regulated, bureaucratic controls and subject to strict licensing system by the government with the need for a licence for any industrial activity, besides the need for compulsory registration before commencing the business.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) The policy of 1956 brought the role of public sector sharply by reserving as many as eighteen areas exclusively for the public sector. In certain areas, private sector was allowed but subject to the requirement of licence and registration. However, public sector could also be set up in these areas if deemed necessary by the Government.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Thus, most critical and important areas of oil, power, heavy equipments, telecom, etc., were exclusively in the domain of public sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Bigger private companies were highly regulated through the monopolies and restrictive trade practices (MRTP) act and known as MRTP companies and similarly foreign companies were regulated through the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) and known as FERA companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) It was believed by the government that as a company grows in size it can resort to monopolistic and exploitative tendencies. As a result even after a licence and commencing of business, the private sector had to seek approval from the government for capacity expansion, diversification and other such business decisions.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) The earlier policies with a view to give public sector commanding heights and control over key industries/services also paved the way for nationalization or take over from private sector. Thus, coal mining, banking, insurance, textile mills (sick industries were taken over to protect employment) earlier in the private sector, were nationalized.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) The pre-1991 policies had price regulation for industrial goods with prices of steel, cement and other basic goods controlled by the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(8) Each and every policy had stressed on the mixed economy character of the economy which  is co-existence of the public and private sector but in reality it was heavily tilted towards the public sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">To summarize, the pre-1991 policies were highly regulated and regimented oriented, near dominance of the public sector and a very limited space but with bureaucratic control over private sector companies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part49.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part51.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
