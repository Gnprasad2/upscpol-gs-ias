Over the past year, JAM has deepened its coverage at an astonishing rate creating around 4 million accounts per week and several mobile money operators were licensed. Cash transfers can directly improve the economic lives of India’s poor, and raise economic efficiency by reducing leakages and market distortions. Implementing Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) at large-scale and in real-time remains one of the government s key objectives, and significant progress has been made in the past year.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">The <b>JAM Trinity: Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile </b>helped government to implement direct benefit transfers effectively.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The requirements if government wanted to transfer ₹ 1000 to every Indian tomorrow are</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. Government must be able to identify the beneficiaries;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Government must be able to transfer money to these beneficiaries;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Beneficiaries must be able to easily access their money.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Failure in the first aspect leads to inclusion errors and leakage as benefits intended for</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the poor flow to rich and “ghost” households, resulting in a fiscal loss. Failure on other two aspects leads to exclusion errors as genuine beneficiaries are unable to avail benefits. The government must be especially sensitive to exclusion errors, which typically hurt the poorest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ingredients of JAM</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The essential components for JAM are listed below:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -21pt;    text-align: justify;">1. Government —» Beneficiary: the challenge of identification: <span class="p">To identify the beneficiaries, the government needs databases of eligible individuals. Beneficiary databases have existed for long before Aadhaar, but their accuracy and legitimacy have been hampered by the administrative and political discretion involved in granting identity proofs like BPL cards, driving licenses and voter IDs. Ghost and duplicate names crept into beneficiary lists, leading to leakage. Aadhaar s virtue lies in using technology to replace human discretion, while keeping the system simple enough, fingerprints and iris scans for citizens to understand. 210 million Aadhaar cards were created in 2015, at an astonishing rate of over 4 million cards per week.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2. Government —&gt; Bank: the challenge of payment:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">After identifying beneficiaries, the government must transfer money to them, for which the government needs their account numbers. This constraint has been eased by the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, under which 120 million accounts were created in the last year alone at a blistering, record-setting pace of over 3 lakh accounts per day. Despite Jan Dhan’s record-breaking feats, basic savings account penetration in most states is still relatively. Policy makers thus need to be cognizant about exclusion errors due  to  DBT  not  reaching  unbanked beneficiaries.Comparing the reach  of Jan Dhan with  that of Aadhaar suggests that  the  unbanked  are more likely to obstruct the spread of JAM than the unidentified.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;    text-align: justify;">3. Bank —&gt; Beneficiary: the last-mile challenge of getting money into people’s hands:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">In rural India, however, there is a serious “last-mile” problem of getting money from the banks into household’s hands: only 27 per cent of villages have a bank within 5 km. To help address this problem, the RBI in 2015 licensed 23 new banks, viz, 2 universal banks, 11 payment banks and 10 small finance banks. Spreading JAM across India’s economy shows that mobile penetration across India is strong. Moreover,</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">there are approximately 1.4 million agents or service posts to serve approximately 1010 million mobile customers in India, a ratio of about 1:720.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">India should take advantage of its deep mobile penetration and agent networks by making greater  use  of mobile payments technology to  improve  the quality and convenience of service delivery. For example, they can inform beneficiaries that food supplies have arrived at the ration shop or fertiliser at the local retail outlet. While some important changes have occurred this year to improve last-mile financial connectivity, still the Bank-Beneficiary connection still appears the weakest link in the JAM chain.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">&quot;Wiping every tear from every eye” based on the principles of universality, unconditionality, and agency is the hallmarks of a Universal Basic Income (UBI). A number of implementation challenges lie ahead, especially the risk that UBI would become an add-on to, rather than a replacement of, current anti-poverty and social programs, which would make it fiscally unaffordable. But given their multiplicity, costs, and questionable effectiveness, and the real opportunities afforded by the rapidly improving “JAM” infrastructure, UBI holds the prospects of improving upon the status quo.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite making remarkable progress in bringing down poverty from about 70 percent at independence to about 22 percent in 2011-12 (Tendulkar Committee), it can safely be said that “wiping every tear from every eye” is about a lot more than being able to imbibe a few calories. And the Mahatma understood that better, deeper, and earlier than all the Marxists, market messiahs, materialists and behaviouralists. He intuited that it is also about dignity, invulnerability, self-control and freedom, and mental and psychological unburdening. From that perspective, Nehrus exhortation that “so long as there are tears and suffering, so long our work will not be over” is very much true nearly 70 years after independence.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Today, an option to realise Gandhiji’s objective presents itself and has entered the policy consciousness in India and around the world: Universal Basic Income, UBI for short. UBI has three components: Universality, Unconditionality, and Agency (by providing support in the form of cash transfers to respect, not dictate, recipients’ choices).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Conceptual/Philosophical Case for UBI</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Universal Basic Income is a radical and compelling paradigm shift in thinking about both social justice and a productive economy. A universal basic income is, like many rights, unconditional and universal: it requires that every person should have a right to a basic income to cover their needs, just by virtue of being citizens. The time has come to think of UBI for a number of reasons:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Social Justice: <span class="p">UBI is, first and foremost, a test of a just and non-exploitative society. A Universal Basic Income promotes many of the basic values of a society which respects all individuals as free and equal. It promotes liberty because it is anti-paternalistic, opens up the possibility of flexibility in labour markets. It promotes equality by reducing poverty. It promotes efficiency by reducing waste in government transfers. And it could, under some circumstances, even promote greater productivity. It is not an accident that Universal Basic Income has been embraced both by thinkers of the Left and of the Right.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Poverty Reduction: <span class="p">Conditional on the presence of a well-functioning financial system, a Universal Basic Income may simply be the fastest way of reducing poverty. UBI is also, paradoxically, more feasible in a country like India, where it can be pegged at relatively low levels of income but still yield immense welfare gains.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Employment: <span class="p">UBI is an acknowledgement that society’s obligation to guarantee a minimum living standard is even more urgent in an era of uncertain employment generation. Moreover, UBI could also open up new possibilities for labour markets. It creates flexibility by allowing for individuals to have partial or calibrated engagements with the labour market without fear of losing benefits. They allow for more non-exploitative bargaining since individuals will no longer be forced to accept any working conditions, just so that they can subsist.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Administrative Efficiency: <span class="p">In India in particular, the case for UBI has been enhanced because of the weakness of existing welfare schemes which are riddled with misallocation, leakages and exclusion of the poor. When the trinity of Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (popularly referred to as JAM) is fully adopted the time would be ripe for a mode of delivery that is administratively more efficient. The administrative argument however has to be made with some care. While Aadhar is designed to solve the identification problem, it cannot, on its own, solve the targeting problem. It is important to recognise that universal basic income will not diminish the need to build state capacity: the state will still have to enhance its capacities to provide a whole range of public goods. UBI is not a substitute for state capacity: it is a way of ensuring that state welfare transfers are more efficient so that the state can concentrate on other public goods.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Conceptual Case against UBI</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">From an economic point of view there are three principal and related objections to a universal basic income. The first is whether UBI reduces the incentive to work. This argument is vastly exaggerated. For one thing, the levels at which universal basic income are likely to be pegged are going to be minimal guarantees at best; they are unlikely to crowd incentives to work. One school of thought would argue that it truly is a diminution of human dignity to suppose that the only motivation for which people work is necessity; take away the yoke of necessity and they will be lazy. The same kinds of arguments used to be made against high wages: that if wages rise beyond a certain level workers will choose leisure over work. There is very little evidence to sustain that proposition.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The second concern is this: Should income be detached from employment? The honest economic answer to this concern is that society already does this, but largely for the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">rich and privileged. Any society where any form of inheritance or accepting non-work related income is allowed, already detaches income from employment. So, receiving a small unearned income as it were, from the state should be economically and morally less problematic than the panoply of “unearned” income our societies allow.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The third is a concern out of reciprocity. If society is indeed a “scheme of social cooperation”, should income be unconditional, with no regard to peoples contribution to society? The short answer is that individuals as a matter of fact will in most cases contribute to society, as stated above. In fact, UBI can also be a way of acknowledging non-wage work related contributions to society.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the current social structure, for example, homemaking contributions of women are largely unacknowledged economically, since they do not take the form of wage or contract employment. It is important that UBI is not framed as a transfer payment from the rich to the poor. Its basis is rather different. UBI gives concrete expression to the idea that we have a right to a minimum income, merely by virtue of being citizens. It is the acknowledgment of the economy as a common project. This right requires that the basic economic structure be configured in a way that every individual gets basic income.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 33pt;    text-align: left;">Arguments in Favour and Against UBI Favor Against</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: left;">Poverty and vulnerability reduction: <span class="p">Poverty and vulnerability will be reduced in one fell swoop.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Choice: A <span class="p">UBI treats beneficiaries as agents and entrusts citizens with the responsibility of using welfare spend­ ing as they see best;
