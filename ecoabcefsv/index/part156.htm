Never in the past has the rupee fallen so much against the USD.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Historical Perspective</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A little before Independence the parity between USD and INR was 1:1, even at the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">time of Independence , the exchange rate was USD 1 = ₹5. However , that was the era of fixed exchange rate , of exchange rates determined by RBI. India was then a ‘closed ’ economy , so exchange rate really did not matter . Post -independence and over the years , India ’s problems mounted , of a rapidly increasing population , low growth , persistent high inflation , growing imports , but not able to earn foreign currency through exports and also as a closed and regulated economy, no other avenues of foreign currency coming into India.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In such circumstances, the rupee was devalued especially after 1966 on a number of occasions, to discourage imports and in a bid to increase exports and reign in the growing trade deficit. In fact trade deficit has become a structural problem of India, of not being able to ‘earn’ USD through exports to ‘pay’ for imports of goods.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Towards Market Exchange Rate</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The reforms initiated in 1991, only inherited current account deficit, even as it began to ‘open’ the economy, moving away from fixed or a pegged exchange rate in a calibrated manner, into  a market-determined exchange rate since 1999. The demand and supply of USD in India began to determine exchange rate and not any more by RBI. As a market- determined exchange rate there would always be movements in exchange rates based on a number of factors, such as levels of current account deficit, inflows and outflows of foreign currencies, influenced through policy environment and both domestic as well as global favourable/adverse developments.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Just as waves in the sea, sometimes going up and sometimes going down, is a natural phenomenon, not restricting but allowing boats and ships to sail. The same is true for market-determined exchange rates, which will depreciate or appreciate depending on demand supply conditions and always be a variable, not possible to predict. An economy like a ship, it has to have the capability to move along the waves.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, waves can get turbulent, forcing ships to drop anchor. This is the flip side of a market-determined exchange rate of a currency sliding against foreign currency, destabilizing economies and pushing them into a crisis-like situation. The present situation in India cannot be said to be a crisis so far, but could be a well become one.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why has the Rupee Depreciated so Steeply?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Ar first depreciation is a ‘symptom’ and not the problem. It is the result and culmination of multiple factors. As mentioned previously, India has chronic and persistent trade deficit leading to high current account deficit. It has ballooned in recent times due to high crude petroleum  prices  and also  surge in imports of  gold.  A  high deficit only implies greater demand for USD (to pay for imports) but not enough supply of USD (through exports), putting pressure on the rupee to depreciate. Once the rupee begins to depreciate, it further widens current account deficit, leading to further down slide of the rupee. At each stage the landing gets harder and harder.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This situation can still be addressed, through inflows in the capital account (refer to Chapter on Balance of Payment), through foreign investment, NRI deposits, External Commercial Borrowings by corporate and other such capital flows to cover current account deficit. This was happening in India till December 2012. The deficit was being met out of foreign currency coming as FDI, but more through F1I (now referred as foreign portfolio investment or as FPI) and NRI deposit. Thus, making the rupee depreciate, just like waves but not turbulent and volatile until May 2013.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The problem in capital account as far as India is concerned, is that it comprises more of reversible flows like FPI and NRI deposits and not through a relative stable flow as FDI. As a result in adverse circumstances, of reversal of such flows, the deficit gets exposed resulting in a steep depreciation of the rupee as it has happened since May 2013.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The reversal can be attributed to the Federal Reserve in the US announcing a gradual withdrawing from quantitative easing (QE) or abandoning its stance of following a loose monetary policy. This was done earlier through buy back of debt by the Federal Reserve to increase the supply of USD. US economy was beginning to recover in terms of turnaround in growth, even though marginal, but definite signs of recovery since beginning of 2013. Continuation of loose monetary policy would have become inflationary which could be a setback to recovery. This would have resulted in lesser supply of USD by Federal Reserve, affecting capital flows in all emerging economies including India.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Signs of revival of the US economy also lifted US stock markets, resulting in a quick withdrawal of FPI from Indian stock markets, an outgo of around USD 6 billion every month since May 2013. With both FDI as well as FPI easing, together with reversal of FPI, affected supply of USD, leading to sharp depreciation of USD.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Rupee during November 2016 closed at a fresh 39-month low against the US dollar, resulting in $5 billion outflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in local equity and bond markets since the government announced the demonetisation scheme.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The FIIs are selling local as well as other emerging market assets on rising expectations of a possible US interest rate hike in its next mid-December policy and as speculation mounts that US president-elect Donald Trumps reflationary policies will mean a quicker pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. The concern that he will take a more protectionist approach to trade has also weighed on developing-nation assets.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The home currency has touched a low of 68.80 a dollar. So far in current year, it has fallen 3.81%.The currency volatility could increase and liquidity could become scarce</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">during bouts of market risk aversion and dollar strength, as the market tests the new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) leaderships tolerance for weakness in the rupee.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Unless the RBI hints at greater tolerance of larger rupee depreciation, there is a constructive medium-term view on the INR and see it as one of the most resilient EM currencies  in  a strong dollar  environment. Potential anti-immigration and anti-trade policies in the US would not bode well for developing economies, and the dollar likely would strengthen next year—particularly against EM currencies. Bond yields gained after the RBI unexpectedly ordered banks to deposit their extra cash with it, in a bid co absorb excess liquidity generated by the government ban on larger banknotes.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">With depreciation of the rupee becoming fairly certain, gave rise to speculation, both on shore and off shore through non-deliverablcs forward (NDF) contracts of rupee and USD. These are contracts which do not require delivery of foreign currency, but only booking of profits, of the difference between the contracted rate and the actual exchange rate on the  contracted date on settlement. These  contracts are in freer  forex markets of Singapore and Dubai, outside regulatory’ control of RBI.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">What are the Implications of Rupee Depreciation on the Indian Economy?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">First, India’s imports comprises of essentials such as crude petroleum, machineries and fertilizers which become expensive raising their prices facilitating ‘import’ of inflation. India is very susceptible to a stubborn and sticky inflation. It hurts the masses in terms of across the board higher prices.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All imports become expensive including raw materials, goods and machineries which further push up domestic costs. It brings with it negative sentiments in the economy, makes investors cautious weary of investment and consumers’ reducing spending in the economy. Thus, growth takes a down turn.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Negative sentiments and capital outflows impact the stock markets, which may not directly affect the common man but gets reflected as part of negative sentiment in the economy. It widens the current account deficit, which may require dipping into scarce foreign exchange reserves and their ‘relative adequacy’ could well become ‘inadequate’ if the deficit continues to widen. One cannot forget the situation of 1991 when India had no other recourse of meeting the deficit by pledging its official levels of gold and seeking commercial loan from International Monetary Fund (refer to Chapter on Multilateral Institutions).</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There are genuine concerns arising out of a depreciating currency of the domestic economy having larger faith in foreign rather than the domestic currency and as mentioned previously, the looming fears of currency crisis.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, a depreciating rupee does make exports cheaper as the same dollar can now get more rupees. But exports are not only a function of prices but other aspects such as quality, ability to meet changing demands and preferences, global demand, efficient logistics, cargo-handling capacities, etc. Response to the historic depreciation of the rupee  has,  for  the first  time,  tested  how  much Indian exports  are  sensitive  to  prices or can lower prices drive up exports from India. The impact cannot be immediate, of an</p><p class="s31" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">overnight increase in exports <span class="p">but over a period of time. Many experts feel that the present</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 7pt;    text-align: left;">depreciation is a correction’ competitiveness.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and in the long run help India in achieving export (price)</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">But definitely a slight depreciation can be considered good as long as it is gradual but not such a steep downslide in such a short span of time can destabilize the economy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What measures are needed to stem the slide of Rupee?</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Repo Rate Hike: <span class="p">RBI can consider a hike in repo rate to incentivise foreign investors to invest in Indian debt securities and stop the exodus of foreign capital from the equity market. This way the demand for the dollar will come down and will provide</span></p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">some support to Rupee.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Currency Market Intervention: <span class="p">RBI can step-up currency market intervention by selling more dollars from its reserves which will cater to the higher demand for the US</span></p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">currency.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Restrict Outward Dollar Remittances: <span class="p">RBI under the liberalised remittances scheme can also restrict outward remittance of dollar which is currently capped at $2.5 lakh.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">NRI Bond Issue: <span class="p">RBI can moot the idea of NRI bonds to boost the dollar reserves of the country and meet the higher redemption pressure from exporters and foreign investors. Through the NRI bonds, RBI can raise dollar deposits from non-resident Indians at attractive rates of return.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Open-Market Operation: <span class="p">RBI can address this situation by improving liquidity in the system through open market purchase of bonds and by reducing the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Have These Measures Delivered?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">It is quite evident that these measures have been unable to check the extreme rupee volatility. It is because these measures are aimed at witnessing rupee depreciation as a problem rather than witnessing it as a symptom. All measures are at compressing demand for USD, and that is a wrong diagnosis. The problem is not of demand but of supply of foreign currency. Any</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">demand compression only allows for leakages, like squeezing a balloon can never contain the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">balloon.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">The answer has to come more in addressing supply side problems of augmenting supply of USD. This will take care of the demand and also stem rupee volatility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Potential Solutions to the Symptom</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">As a first step, the government should go all out to push exports of goods and services, remove all bottlenecks to exports and provide logistics support. This is a ‘rare’ opportunity for Indian exports, as rupee has depreciated more sharply than currencies of other emerging economies, clearly making Indian goods and services virtually the cheapest globally. With US recovering and so also the euro zone means global markets would also be looking up.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">he exporters could not have asked for a better time than the present. The response both y the government as well as the exporters has to be quick’.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 9pt;    text-align: justify;">All government departments dealing with exports should be directed to cut red-tapism nd provide fast clearances wherever required to facilitate faster and quicker exports. Banks hould be mandated to provide liberal funding for exports.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All pending FDI proposals with the foreign investment promotion board (FIPB) hould be fast tracked and cleared expeditiously. Further, FDI norms should be further iberalized to attract more FDI. All efforts have to be made to get India back on the growth rajectory. Speed up investment by the government, expedite investment proposals held p in bureaucratic red-tapism. Initiate government level reforms non-controversial and asy to implement. It is not about ‘bold reforms’ but ‘quick reforms’.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Government has done well to restrict non-essential imports to reduce CAD. As a urther step, India could import more from Iran where it has ‘rupee payment agreement’. ndia could also flag the issue of trade deficit with China, of India importing more from China than what it exports. Reducing trade deficit with China (USD 39 billion) would lso ease the pressure on CAD.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It could also be the time  for  India to go  for ‘full’  convertibility of the  rupee,  as it would encourage inflows. Outflows may not be a worry at this stage as USD has become xpensive. Convertibility would also allow surfacing of the underground USD into money market augmenting supply of USD.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">These are difficult times for the Indian rupee, but not questioning inherent strengths which are still fundamentally strong and cannot be said as a crisis as being reported in he media, the press and even some analysts. There is a definite unwarranted pessimism. The levels of savings, availability of resources for investment, levels of forex reserves and potential domestic demand are all strong factors of India.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is time for a collective action of reversing the negative sentiments and restoring the aith back on the Indian Economy, through appropriate mix of policies, shaking of the political and bureaucratic lethargy and re-bouncing on high growth path with a stable upee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Impossible Trinity&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">It may be observed that exchange rate management is complex and a challenge for any central bank. &#39;There is also the ‘impossible trinity’ that it is impossible for any central bank o  manage  ‘exchange  rates,  open  current  accounts  and independent  monetary  policy’ all at the same time. At best, it can manage any two of them but not all the three. This is he biggest challenge before any central bank of which two, to manage, when all three are mperatives, especially in adverse circumstances.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) and Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">With increased trading partners and geographies, the conventional market-determined rate while being useful for transaction purposes does not allow an understanding of export competitiveness over a period of time. The REER is a weighted average of volumes of trade, their exchange rates, adjusted for respective inflation of major trading partners and comprises of USD, Pounds Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, HK dollars and Chinese Yuan.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This index is fairly an useful measure of increasing or erosion of competitiveness</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">across major trading partners over a period of time. The NEER is a broader measure of export competitiveness comprising of currencies of thirty-six countries but without any adjustment for inflation across economies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Exchange Rate and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">We have seen that the exchange rates in the ideal sense be a reflection of differences in purchasing power of economies on account of various factors. However, this is true only if the entire global world had free trade, without any restrictions, ability of goods to move across geographies without any hindrance, similar like a bird flying, ability to reach any part of the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, the reality is quite the contrary with restrictions to trade, tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade. Exchange rates are influenced by many other factors such as inflows, thus completely diluting it as a measure of differential purchasing power across countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">If the Indian Rupee is appreciating against the USD, it does not imply improvement in the purchasing power. By using the conventional exchange rate, without adjustment for purchasing power would not be a correct measure for comparison of economies in a common currency.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, was borne the concept of purchasing power parity (PPP) which is the adjustment made to the exchange rate such that they truly represent differences in purchasing power. PPP is now a globally accepted methodology being used for all international comparisons but all actual transactions in foreign currency<span class="s19">7 </span>and their conversion would continue to’ be guided by the conventional exchange rate.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, all comparisons of GDP and GNI per capita is done both by using the conventional exchange rates for USD of economies and also on adjusted exchange rate or at PPP. The use of USD as a common denominator, for all international comparison purposes is for historical reasons and also because of the US being the largest economy ir. terms of its output.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In a later section, a comparison of the Indian economy from a global perspective tc facilitate an understanding of its global position both by using the conventional exchange rate and also at PPP will be discussed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s97" style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FOREIGN EXCHANGE</p><p class="s97" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 178pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RESERVES</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">CHAPTER</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part155.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part157.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
