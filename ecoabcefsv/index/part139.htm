In addition, in a previous section on Exports, it was mentioned that an adverse feature of the Indian Economy has been year after year imports were more than exports.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What does it mean? It basically implies that India has never been able to earn foreign currency through exports to that extent to meet payment obligations in foreign currency for imports of goods. That is, the first thing to understand about open economies on their ability to ‘earn foreign currencies through exports to pay for the import needs of the economy i.e., the criticality of exports.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is clearly known that India is an importer of crude petroleum and increased consumption of petro goods would require India to export sufficiently to cover the import required of crude petroleum. Exports have been extensively addressed in the previous section.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Open economies would have both domestic as well as foreign currencies and as trade increases with more of exports and imports, there has to be a tracking mechanism in the economy of the foreign currencies going out on account of imports and other factors and the foreign currencies coming into the country on account of exports and other such factors.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Uns is what known as the ‘balance of payments’ (BOP) of a country, which is a separate and independent ‘record of all transactions being done in the foreign currencies in the country: The BOP of country assumes great significance for open economies. In India, the responsibility of maintaining the BOP lies with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). RBI is not only the apex monetary authority, controller of liquidity but also has a larger role to play in open economies of maintaining the BOP. How is the record of transactions maintained?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part138.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part140.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
