Following reasons can be attributed for poor progress of land reforms.</p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">1. <span class="s9">Absence of Reliable Records: </span><span class="p">The absence of reliable and updated land records is the biggest hurdle for the slow progress of land reforms. The reporting system is weak and irregular and there has been no systematic programme review. Therefore, it is not possible to identify obstacles in the way of implementation of land reform.</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">2. <span class="s39">Inadequate Financial Support: </span><span class="p">Lack of financial support is yet another obstacle in the way of land reforms. There is a lack of  adequate budget allocation  for the purpose of land reforms. This is largely responsible for the poor results of land reform measures.</span></p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">3. <span class="s9">Absence of Integrated Approach: </span><span class="p">Land reform programmes has been viewed in isolation from the mainstream of economic development of the country. The lack of integrated approach towards the abolition of intermediary tenures, tenancy reforms and ceiling of holdings etc. lack proper coordination. This contributes for the failure of land reforms efforts.</span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. <span class="s9">Improper Implementation: </span><span class="p">The responsibilities for the implementation of land reforms are vested with the revenue administration in the states. Since high priority</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">is allotted for the maintenance of public order, collection of land revenue and other regulatory functions, land reforms get least attention.</p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">5. <span class="s9">Legal Challenges: </span><span class="p">Legal problems also pose a hurdle in the way of implementation of land reforms in the country. Loopholes in the laws and prolonged litigation derail the process of land reforms. The laws related to land reforms are defective in many ways.</span></p><p class="s37" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">6. <span class="s9">Lack of awareness and pressure from Below: </span><span class="p">A Task Force of Planning Commission had once observed that, “except in few scattered and localized pockets, practically all over the country the poor peasants and agricultural workers are passive, un­ organized and non co-operative.” The beneficiaries of land reforms do not constitute an identifiable social or economic group. As a result, there has been no pressure from below for its effective implementation.</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">7. <span class="s9">Lack of Political Will: </span><span class="p">There is a lack of political will in the enactment of progressive measures and their efficient implementation. Such strong measures require strong political decisions and effective political support, direction and control. But, political will is not forthcoming due to the existence of democratic political power structure of the country.</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">8. <span class="s9">Indifferent Attitude of the Administration: </span><span class="p">The whole responsibility of the implementation of land reforms rests with the revenue department of the states . But, the attitude of the administrative staff is quite indifferent and their behavior is cold . Along with this , the village functionaries are largely under the influence of landlords.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part43.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part45.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
