The BOT would be in surplus if inflows of foreign currencies in the economy through exports are more than outflow of foreign currencies on account of imports. Conversely, it would mean a deficit on the BOT. This is what has been referred earlier of a structural trade</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">deficit in India, of insufficiency of foreign currencies through exports of goods to meet the foreign currency required to pay for critical imports.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The second kind of account is the balance on invisibles (BOI). Just as there are imports and exports of goods, there are also imports and exports of services such as banking, shipping, insurance, software, consultancy, etc. This account maintains records of transactions in foreign currencies resulting out of export and import of services.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What could be other types of transactions in foreign exchange other than for import and export of goods and services covered in balance of invisibles. These could be for the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) <span class="s9">Inward and Outward Tourism—</span>tourist arriving to India (inward) would require rupees to spend for which they would like to exchange their respective foreign currencies into rupees. Similarly, Indians going abroad (outward) would require foreign currency.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) <span class="s9">Inward and Outward Remittances—</span>many Indians about 35 million are settled overseas in different countries also known as the ‘Indian diaspora’. Many of them send money to their family. As they are earning in foreign currency they would send the money in foreign currency (inward remittance) which would be exchanged in rupees in India and given to the beneficiary. Similarly, Foreign residents in India may also like to remit money overseas (outward remittance).</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) <span class="s9">Inward and Outward Education—</span>there is an increasing trend of Indian students seeking higher education abroad (outward education). They would need to cover for their fees in foreign currency.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Similarly, foreign students wishing to study in India (inward education) would need Indian rupees to cover their expenses in India. Further, there may also be a need of foreign currency for overseas medical treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In all the above transactions, there will thus be a ‘net effect’ which is either positive or negative depending on which transactions are more. For example, net tourism will be positive if foreign currencies being surrendered (by foreign tourist for rupees) is more than foreign currencies being demanded (by Indian tourists going abroad) and vice versa and similarly for remittances and education.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All the aforementioned transactions which are net tourism, net remittances, net education and for medical treatment are reflected in the balance of invisibles’ (BOI) of the BOP. Thus, BOI records transactions in foreign currencies relating to export and import of services, net tourism, remittances, education and medical treatment. This could also be either positive or negative depending on which is more.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Both the BOT as well as the BOI constitute the balance on current account of the BOP. Accordingly, the BOP may have a current account surplus (CAS) or a current account deficit (CAD) and CAS will result in the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">With both BOT It can also be large enough</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and BOI in surplus or positive.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 3pt;    text-align: left;">possible with a deficit on BOT but with a surplus on BOI sufficiently to wipe out the deficit on BOT.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">On the other CAD will result if there is Deficit on BOT and BOI.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Deficit on BOT and a surplus on BOI but not sufficient enough to wipe out the BOT.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">It appears to be complicated but there is requirement to understand these concepts failing which problems of open economics and crises may be difficult to comprehend. An illustration of an open economy, say A is explained below:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Exports of goods USD 100 million Imports of goods USD 250 million BOI USD 200 million</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Economy A has a deficit on BOT of USD 150 million but a CAS of USD 50 million . If the economy had a BOI of USD 100 million it would have a CAD of USD 50 million . A surplus on the current account can thus happen both with a surplus and also with deficit on BOT depending on the BOI.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Inflows of foreign currencies (coming into the country) are more’ than the outflow of foreign currencies (going out of the country) in an economy. A CAD would imply the reverse i.e., outflows of foreign currencies are more than the inflows of foreign currencies in an economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">How is the difference between outflows and inflow&#39;s met? This would take us into the third account of BOP maintained by the RBI which is a record of transactions other than’ those on the current account.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Transactions other than those on the current account is referred as capital account transactions and would comprise of the following:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1)</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Foreign Investment—<span class="p">this will be discussed separately later. However, this inflows of foreign currencies into the economy for investment purposes.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">represents</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;text-align: left;">(2) <span class="s9">Deposits—</span>many of the Indian diaspora settled abroad maintain deposits <span class="s31">in foreign </span>currencies in India known as NRI</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) <span class="s9">Borrowings—</span>private sector can borrow in the international currency and so can the government bilaterally or from multilateral institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) <span class="s9">External Assistance and Grants—</span>government can also receive assistance and grants from other countries in foreign currencies. But this was relevant in closed economies.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">All the above transactions are known as capital account transactions and get reflected in the capital account’ of the BOP. The balance on current account and capital account constitutes the BOP of the country. The BOP necessarily like a balance sheet has to balance, or no difference between assets and liabilities. Similarly in the case of BOP ‘inflows’ will have to be matched with outflows’ one way or the other. Thus BOP has to be zero. Thar is, any CAD would have to be met out of capital foreign currency inflows of either foreign investment or NRI deposits and if not there, our of borrowings by the government to meet the CAD.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However. BOP can also be zero under:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(1) There is CAS. The excess inflows going to augment the foreign exchange reserves.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(2) There is a CAD but sufficient capital inflows other than borrowings to wipe the deficit.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, by looking at the BOP it is not possible to comment on the health of the economy on the trade front of whether, there is CAD or CAS. BOP is solely an account’ of inflows and outflows of foreign currencies and the manner in which inflows and outflows on the current account are matched. The true picture can, however, be seen from the current account of the BOP. As an open economy, the balances on current account of economies become extremely relevant.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Suppose an economy has CAD of USD 100 million. It does not have capital inflows. How does the government acquire foreign currencies to meet the deficit? Remember fiscal deficit, the government could print rupees to meet the deficit or borrow rupees from the market. Hie government can never be a defaulter in borrowings given its sovereign powers to print home currency.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the absence of capital inflows, the government would have to borrow from the international market. Any borrowing in the market for meeting CAD is crisis for the economy because how does the economy pay back the amount borrowed? It would amount to placing economic sovereignty at stake, leading to economic sub-judication.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">A high CAD has been a common denominator in all the crisis-ridden economies in the past and as a parameter closely monitored by all open economies. Both the CAD as well as fiscal deficit are known as the ‘twin deficits’ that is necessary evils and little to choose between, in terms of damaging impact on economies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part139.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part141.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
