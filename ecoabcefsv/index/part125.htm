China initiated their transformation in the seventies and India still later in the nineties. It can be said that curtains have fallen on the era of closed economies with the largest inward-looking economies which comprises of the erstwhile USSR, China and more recently India having adopted open policies through reforms in the domestic sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">India’s efforts at globalization, as mentioned previously in the nineties, was a part of Economic Reforms of 1991 centred around the three pillars of liberalization, privatization and globalization also known as the L,P,G of economic reforms. Liberalization and pri­ vatization are to achieve domestic competitiveness while globalization is to achieve global competitiveness. Their roles are complimentary reinforcing each other. It is not possible to achieve the global competitiveness unless domestic sector is competitive and efficient.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All of them are processes rather than objectives to achieve better qualitative growth and widespread economic betterment, besides meeting ever expanding domestic requirements of the economy but with the active government interventions. India’s efforts at globalization had two significant aspects—one was the trade-related globalization which was relatively slow, compared to the other aspect of financial integration, with the capital inflows on the current and capital account sharply increasing and exceeding 100 per cent of the GDP Globalization is a relatively new concept, dynamic, continuously evolving, requiring redefinition in terms of need and the most important aspect is, it is driven naturally across economies and could be said to have crossed the stage of ‘as a matter of choice’, but a matter of‘compulsion’ or being driven naturally with the tide.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part124.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part126.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
