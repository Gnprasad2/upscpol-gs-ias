It is expected to leverage an investment of over ₹ 50,000 crores over a period of time.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) IIFCL, Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC), Citigroup, and Blackstone Group have jointly announced a launch of USS 5 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) IIFCL has set up a subsidiary at London with funds of USD 5 billion to fund Indian companies importing capital goods/machineries exclusively for infrastructure projects in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) The Planning Commission of India has proposed a USD 11 billion multi infra debt funds for funding infrastructure projects in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) The government has recently announced the public private sector partnership (PPP) model for infrastructure projects in India.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) This model seeks to leverage on the strengths of the government (inter-ministerial clearances, environment and forest clearances, shifting of vital installations and land acquisitions).</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) The private sector is then entrusted the task of building the infrastructure in terms of government specifications by using their own resources in a given time period. There is an incentive mechanism for projects completed ahead of schedule.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(c) In turn, it allows the private sector to levy pre-agreed ‘Toll’ (for road projects) or ‘user charges ’ (airports ) under the build -operate -transfer (BOT ) model of partnership.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(d) A slight variant to this is design-build-finance-operate (DBFO) where the competence in the ‘design of projects is also done by the private sector rather than by the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(e) Recently, the government under the PPP model has also initiated levying of ‘negative grants’ for highly profitable road projects.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(f) The private companies while bidding for such projects would also have to provide the amount of money from their likely future earnings they are willing to give ‘Up-front’ before the contract is awarded by the government, as what is known as negative grant.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Urban Infrastructure</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Government of India has launched the following schemes for development of urban infrastructure:</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: justify;">1. Smart Cities: <span class="p">The Government of India has launched a mission on Smart Cities, with the collaboration of states and UTs for implementation of the flagship pro­ gramme for urban development. The purpose of the Smart Cities Mission is to drive economic growth and improve the quality of life of people by enabling local area development and harnessing technology, especially technology that leads to smart outcomes.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Smart Cities Mission targets promoting cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of‘smart’ solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas and create a replicable model which will act like</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">a lighthouse to other aspiring cities. The core infrastructure development in a smart city includes adequate water supply; assured electricity supply; sanitation, including solid waste management; efficient urban mobility and public transport; affordable housing, especially for the poor; robust IT connectivity and digitalization; good governance, especially e-Govcrnance and citizen participation; sustainable environment; safety and security of citizens, particularly women, children and the elderly; and health and education.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The strategic components of area-based development in the Smart Cities Mission are city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (greenfield development) plus a pan-city initiative in which smart solutions are applied covering larger parts of the city. Retrofitting will introduce planning in an existing built-up area to achieve smart city objectives, along with other objectives, to make the existing area more efficient and liveable. In retrofitting, an area consisting of more than 500 acres will be identified by the city in consultation with citizens. Redevelopment will effect a replacement of the existing built-up environment and enable co-creation of a new layout with enhanced infrastructure using mixed land use and increased density. Redevelopment envisages an area of more than 50 acres, identified by ULBs in consultation with citizens. Greenfield development will introduce most of the smart solutions in a previously vacant area (more than 250 acres) using innovative planning, plan financing and plan implementation tools (e.g. land pooling/ land  reconstitution) with provision for affordable housing, especially for the poor. Greenfield development is required around cities in order to address the needs of the expanding population.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Mission will cover 100 cities which have been distributed among the states and UTs on the basis of equitable criteria. The distribution of smart cities will be reviewed after two years of the implementation of the mission. Based on an assessment of the performance of states/ULBs in the challenge, some reallocation of the remaining potential smart cities among states may need to be done by the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;"><span class="s9">2. Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM): </span>The SBM aims at making India free from open defecation and at achieving 100 percent scientific management of municipal solid waste in 4041 statutory towns/cities in the country.
