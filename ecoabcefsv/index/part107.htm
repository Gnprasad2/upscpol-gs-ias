Mutual funds allow for sharing of risk or minimizing the risk in terms of risk appetite.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Mutual fund operators are specialized institutions who pool money from the public and</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">then invest in the stock markets based on the research, past trends, company performance, so as to maximize the value to investors. There are various options available to an investor of reinvestment of the profits earned or taking back the profits at the discretion of the investor.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It should, however, be clearly understood that mutual funds do not ‘eliminate’ risk but ‘minimize’ the risk in terms of risk appetite. Mutual fund operators are in the public sector such as the Unit Trust of India and also in the private sector and foreign companies. It is gradually emerging in India with a large number of middle class preferring to invest in mutual funds in India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">In recent times, there has been an increased preference of mutual fund companies as well as insurance companies to combine the investments in stock markets with life insurance plans, known as ULIPs. This need has arisen as there is very low penetration of life insurance in India or lack of awareness of the need for such policies, compared to other countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The insurance sector till recently was government-controlled with the LIC acting as the sole institutions for selling of life insurance products, till recently, based on the recommendations made by R. N. Malhotra committee, of opening the insurance sector to private players.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Even though insurance sector has been opened for both private as well as foreign companies, the equity cap for foreign equity is 26 per cent, i.e., foreign players can come in solely as a joint venture with an Indian company. Despite the opening of the insurance sector, life insurance penetration is fairly low in India.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As part of the efforts of both the mutual funds as well as the insurance companies to expand their base, ULIP was seen as a way to attract a larger number of the untapped vast potential of the country. The logic followed by the people for insurance products was that they should also give a reasonable assured return besides the life cover to them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There is a fundamental flaw in the perception of not being able to understand that investments for life cover and investments in mutual funds are with different objectives. A life insurance cover cannot be seen as maximizing returns. It is a protection to the family in case of untimely demise and for uncertainty of life. Protection has to come first before looking at maximizing returns.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All insurance companies have such policies known as endowment policies, with fairly low levels of premium , but have no returns , except the life cover for the amount insured . The other aspect not understood is the fact that ‘lower the age, lower is the premium; and higher the age, higher is the premium’ for the same amount of sum assured. At young age, the endowment</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">policies have very low levels of premium.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The insurance companies rather than educating the people of these fundamental issues choose the option of combining the returns with life covers resulting in higher premium and denying the benefits of maximizing returns or a decent sum assured as life insurance cover.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This has also led to regulatory conflicts as the insurance companies as pure insurance companies are controlled by the insurance regulatory development authority (IRDA) while mutual funds come under SEBI. As a larger number of insurance companies while investing in mutual funds were outside the purview of SEBI and IRDA with only responsibility of insurance business had no role in their investment in mutual funds. While, the investment by the insurance companies in mutual funds had no regulators making it difficult for SEBI to protect the interests of the investors.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, more than this conflict is to spread awareness amongst the people of setting aside some money for life cover and not as an investment but as a protection measure, merely as one saves for a rainy day without bothering for returns.</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Depending on income levels and family requirements, a certain portion may be invested with the sole objective of maximizing returns for the people. This would be a judicious decision achieving both the objectives rather than combining the two as an UL1P, as a better option.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part106.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part108.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
