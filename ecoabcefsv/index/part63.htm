It runs around 12,000 passenger and 7000 freight trains daily. Only recently it has achieved a landmark of crossing 1 billion tonnes of freight movement.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Indian railway has dual function one of running commercially (freight operations) and the other social responsibility of being the life line (passenger movement) of the country. Bulk of the profits of railways thus comes out of freight operations. During 1951-1952, the ratio of freight shares of railways to roadways was 79:21. The railways enjoyed total dominance of bulk cargo as well as retail parcel cargo on medium and long haul routes. However, over the last 60-odd years, the ratio has been completely reversed and now road freight has a market share in excess of 80 per cent. More interestingly, roadways now have 95 per cent share of retail parcel cargo transport. Even in bulk movement the share of rail movement is only 35 per cent and 60 per cent by road. In China, freight movement by road is only 22 per cent while in US it is 37 per cent. This essentially implies that freight movement by road is cheaper than the rail in India unlike other countries such as China and US where movement of freight by rail is cheaper than road.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This is despite the fact that the movement by roads has disadvantages, such as inclement weather conditions, fears of theft, accidents and also involves interstate movement resulting in crossing and checking at octroi check points, which could result in hold up, if papers and materials are not in order.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Problems of Rail Freight</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">First and the foremost reason for this is the high cost of rail movement arising out of policy of cross subsidization by IR. Passenger fares especially sleeper class are underpriced and made up through increased freight fares. In India, passenger rail fares are highly politically sensitive. However, this is also because of the social responsibility character of IR. At the same time, actual cost should be recovered. If fares are to be kept low, efforts should also be made to bring down costs at the same time. If passenger fares are to be lower than costs, then the difference should be recoverable from the government and not from freight charges.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">According to the figures compiled by the World Bank, the freight rates charged by IR are extremely high compared to major freight railways such as US Railroads, Chinese and Russian Railways. In fact, the rates of US Railroads are only one-fourth of that charged by IR. Germany is the only country which has freight charges higher than India, but it is nor among the major railway freight movers globally.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ihis is reflected in a fall in the fare-freight ratio for IR over the last five years, from 0.32 to</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">0.26. In sharp contrast to this, the fare-freight ratio for China is 1.2 and for South Korea 1.4. The passenger fares to freight ratio for the Chinese Railways is four times higher than that of India. This shows that even a Communist country such as China is charging remunerative fares to run their railway network, which is considered far more efficient than that of India.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Second reason is that over 60 per cent of the freight movement is through electric traction which has high initial capital cost and also high overheads, resulting in higher cost for freight movement. There has always been a debate around diesel versus electric traction. However, there has been no empirical evidence found over superiority of electric over diesel traction. It has been established that initial capital cost of electric traction is</p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">124</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">manifold more than that of diesel traction. This becomes more relevant in the case of India as it is deficit in power and electric traction of the railways will always get priority over the other users. The only positive factor is that it does not have variable price like that of diesel. The other point in this is the diesel and electric traction cannot be seen as alternates but as complements and a mix of say 50:50, given the vulnerability of supply and prices of imported crude petroleum.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">One method of distribution is to allocate passenger traffic for electric traction and freight traffic for diesel traction. Allocating specific operational and geographic areas to either mode is another method. The objective is to give equal importance to both the modes.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Flexibility of diesel traction is its main advantage. Diesel traction is highly flexible and adaptable to future technological advancements such as the ‘fuel cell’ technology, posed as a promising alternative source of energy in the near future. Under this technology, a simple device combines hydrogen from a variety of fuels w ith oxygen from air to produce electricity. This requires no moving parts, and does not produce noise or smoke. Diesel locomotives can be easily converted by replacing engine with fuel cell.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">According to the International Railway Journal, fuel cell trains shall be a reality in the near future. All overhead wires will then become redundant. A breakthrough has already been achieved by BHEL, Hyderabad. As and when it is imbibed all controversies around diesel versus electric traction would cease.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is of vital importance that for the moment, we do not ignore the fact that both diesel as well as electric traction can meet the needs of the IR with equal efficiency. IF electric traction has a high capital cost, diesel traction is highly sensitive to diesel prices. Had diesel prices been that of the eighties, one could say diesel is preferable but not at todays prices. Thus, there should be no attempt at developing one mode at the cost of the other.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Whatever is the mode of movement either by road or rail, the entire logistics sector has a large number of inefficiencies, as a result the cost of logistics in India remains high at 13-14 per cent of GDP as against 7-8 per cent of GDP in developed countries including China.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Remedial Measures</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">First and the foremost are the passenger fares that need to be raised to cover costs of operations especially for sleeper class in general. Higher classes should be seen from the commercial angle and not as part of social responsibility. If at all, any cross subsidization should be there, it may be ‘inter class’, between sleeper class and the higher classes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Secondly, it needs to streamline its freight operation and raise the share in freight movement to around 50 per cent from the present level of 35 per cent which can be done through PPP model and wherever possible through privatization. Towards this the government has taken a few steps in recent times.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Private Sector Participation</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Indian railways has announced opening up of freight train and terminal operations to private firms. Under thenew private freight terminal (PFT) and special freight train</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">operator (SFTO) scheme, the ministry has allowed private firms to use the IR’s network for commodity transport and to develop freight terminals. Private players will be allowed to set up PFTs and also to operate freight trains. The ministry plans to extend this to the existing registered container train operators and users having private sidings on private</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">land. The license fee, under the SFTO scheme ranges between ₹ 5 crores and 15 crores, which depends on the commodity being moved.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The SFTO scheme offers a freight rebate of 12 per cent for a period of 20 years until the recovery of investment, whichever is earlier. This could prove to be beneficial to private operators. It also addresses serious issues such as empty return load, which would be exempted from freight charges by the 1R. The private operator will be free to charge his customer freight and the handling charges.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The SFTO will be operated for movement of goods such as bulk fertilizers, cement, fly ash, chemicals , petrochemicals , steel, etc. A major concern with logistics companies is thetact that the automobile segment has not been included in this scheme.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Under the PFT policy, operators will be able to book and handle all the traffic excluding</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">outward coal, coke and iron-ore traffic. The revenue sharing for green field projects would start after five years of commissioning the terminal and after two years of commissioning a brown field project. The revenue-sharing model would be of 50 per cent of the then</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">prevailing rate of terminal charge leviable at goods sheds or ₹10 per tonnes, whichever is higher. Revenue sharing will be annually increased by indexing it to increase in whole price index ( WPI).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The ‘own your wagon’ scheme was introduced during 2005. The scheme focused on assured supply of a guaranteed number of rakes every month to a customer based on the number of rakes procured by him with freight concessions. Private firms faced turnaround issues due to congestion and the scheme did not really take off as envisaged.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">However, the most ambitious project being undertaken, seen as a game changer, is the dedicated freight corridor (DFC). The Prime Minister has addressed that the DFC Project costing nearly ₹ 1 lakh crores should be given the highest priority by central ministries and urged the state governments also to do so. The project will connect a land mass over 3300 km in the country and could prove to be a backbone of India’s economic transport facility.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The western corridor from Dadri in Uttar Pradesh to JNPT near Mumbai will be 1499</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">.•on and will connect Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra with an exclusive high speed railway track. The Eastern DFC from Ludhiana (Punjab) to Dankuni (West Bengal) will be 1839 km long and will connect Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. A major part of western corridor will be funded with Japanese assistance and nearly two- third of the eastern corridor will be constructed with World Bank assistance.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">With India joining the select group of billion plus club in freight movement, the rocus has once again shifted on the prestigious DFC. The project will enhance the freight carrying capacity of railways by manifold leading to incremental gains, apart from freeing the existing lines on congestion. The project cost of eastern and western DFC is currently</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">estimated at ₹ 95,836 crores , which also includes cost of land. Western DFC is funded by loan from Japan International Cooperation Agency. While part of Eastern DFC, of Ludhiana- Khurja-Dadri-Kanpur-Mughalsarai section is funded by World Bank.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The DFC will not only decongest the existing lines, which will in turn also help in increasing the speed of passenger trains, leading in to other benefits. The DFC though will run almost parallel with the existing lines but will not be used for moving passengers. Its aim is to provide multi-modal system for moving goods. The plan to construct DFCs across the country marks a strategic inflexion point in the history of IR that has essentially run mixed traffic across its network. Once completed, the DFCs will enable IR to improve its customer orientation and meet market needs more effectively. Creation of rail infrastructure on such a scale—unprecedented in independent India—is also expected to drive the establishment of industrial corridors and logistic parks along its alignment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Over two hundred locomotives with 9000 horse power (HP) are being bought from Japan that will run on DFC. The carrying capacity of rakes will increase from the current 300 tonnes to over 12,000 tonnes. Even the length of the train will increase to 1500 m.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Length distribution of the corridor indicates that Rajasthan (39 per cent) and Gujarat (38 per cent) together constitute 77 per cent of the total length of the alignment of freight corridor, followed by Haryana and Maharashtra 10 per cent each and Uttar Pradesh and National Capital Region of Delhi 1.5 per cent of total length each. This DFC envisages a high-speed connectivity for High Axle Load Wagons (25 tonnes) of double stacked container trains supported by high power locomotives. The Delhi-Mumbai leg of the Golden Quadrilateral National Highway also runs almost parallel to the freight corridor. This corridor will be equipped with an array of infrastructure facilities such as power facilities, rail connectivity to ports en route, etc. Approximately, 180 million people, 14 per cent of the population, will be benefitted by the corridor’s development.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This project incorporates nine mega industrial zones of about 200—250 sq. km, high speed freight line, three ports, and six air ports; a six-lane intersection-free expressway connecting the country’s political and financial capitals and also a 4000 MW power plant. Several industrial estates and clusters, industrial hubs, with top-of-the-line infrastructure would be developed along this corridor to attract more foreign investment. Funds for the projects will be from the Indian government, Japanese loans, and investment by Japanese firms and through Japan depository receipts issued by the Indian companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This high-speed connectivity between Delhi and Mumbai offers immense opportunities for development of an industrial corridor along the alignment of the connecting infrastructure. A band of 150 km (influence region) has been chosen on both sides of the freight corridor to be developed as the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor. The vision for DMIC is to create strong economic base in this band with globally competitive environment and state-of-the-art infrastructure to activate local commerce, enhance foreign investments, real-estate investments and attain sustainable development. In addition to the influence region, DMIC would also include development of requisite feeder rail/road connectivity to hinterland/markets and select ports along the western coast.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor is being conceived as a model industrial corridor of international standards with emphasis on expanding the manufacturing and services</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">base and develop DMIC as the ‘global manufacturing and trading hub’. The government is considering this ambitious project to establish, promote and facilitate Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor to augment and create social and physical infrastructure on the route which is world class and will help spurring economic growth of the region.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Integrated Investment Regions and Industrial Areas (IAs) have been identified within the corridor to provide transparent and investment friendly facility regimes. These regions are proposed to be self-sustained industrial townships with world-class infrastructure, road and rail connectivity for freight movement to and from ports and logistics hubs, served by domestic/ international air connectivity, reliable power, quality social infrastructure, and provide a globally competitive environment conducive for setting up businesses. An Investment Region would  be a specifically  delineated industrial  region  with a minimum</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">area of over 200 sq. km (20,000 hectares), while an IAs would be developed with a minimum area of over 100 sq. km (10,000 hectares).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As mentioned earlier, it is very ambitious project and once completed it will redefine freight movement, provide multipliers to increase growth, create employment opportunities and also the beginning of making IR a basis for all round development with an efficient mode of state-of-the-art transportation facilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite these recent initiatives, there are still other issues which IR needs to address over a certain period of time.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Railways have to become a part of a holistic ‘national logistic policy’ covering all modes of transport with linkages and complementarities between rail, road and sea. Expansion of rail network should keep the economic rather the political perspective. The government should expedite establishing rail links especially in the NE states and also with neighbouring countries. This would provide for better links and relations in and around the region.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It should also review the practice of having a separate budget for railways, a practice initiated by the British rule since 1924. Budgetary allocation made to defense, oil sector are much more than allocations made to railways. By the same token, there should also be a separate budget for defense. Or is it that IR is more important than defense. These are some aspects which the government should examine.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">To conclude, railways, ports and roads have to become a part of multi modal logistics in India, for achieving efficiency, cut down time and costs, in transportation of goods from the producers to the ultimate user both in India and overseas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">High Speed Training Project</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) which undertook the study on the feasibility of this prestigious project, submitted its report in July 2015. The project was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, in December 2015, to be implemented with Japanese technical and financial assistance. The memorandum of understanding for cooperation between India and Japan was signed on 12<span class="s19">th </span>December 2015. A new special purpose vehicle with 50 per cent equity participation from the Ministry of Railways and 50 per cent from the state governments of Maharashtra and Gujarat was to be set up to implement the project.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part62.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part64.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
