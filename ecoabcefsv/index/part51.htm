Though reforms were there before this also but they were as changes being effected but not seen as reforms made as explicit in the policy of 1991. It is also known as the New Industrial Policy or the New Economic Policy, and also known as the policy of liberalization or</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">end of licence/permit raj or even end of bureaucratic control over functioning of the industrial sector, particularly private sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The policy aimed at greater freedom for doing businesses outside the government control, reduced the role for public sector, de-reserving areas and larger role for the private sector, doing away with MRTP/FERA act and dispensing with MRTP and FERA companies. This lifted all bureaucratic control on their functioning. Price regulation paved a way to the market determined prices for most of the industrial goods. The policy emphasized on greater competition and level playing field for all players.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It advocated liberal foreign investment policies to attract foreign investment in the country (more about this in upcoming sections). Broadly, the New Economic Policy or the Industrial Policy 1991 has three broad areas which are as follows:</p><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1) <span class="p">Liberalization.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">2) <span class="p">Public sector.</span></p><p class="s51" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">3) <span class="p">Foreign investment.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liberalization</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Liberalization as a policy basically dispensed with the earlier licensing and the registration system providing the freedom to private sector to set up industries without either the need for a licence or a need for registration. De-licensing was the most important aspect of the policy of liberalization. Two areas, atomic energy and railways would not be open for private sector participation. Even while doing away with the licensing system certain critical areas still require a licence but opened up for private sector participation which are as follows:</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1) <span class="p">Any kind of fire arms and ammunition, explosives.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">2) <span class="p">Drugs and pharmaceuticals.</span></p><p class="s51" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">3) <span class="p">Coal mining.</span></p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4) <span class="p">Defence equipments.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5) <span class="p">All kinds of wines, cigarettes and spirits.</span></p><p class="s51" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6) <span class="p">Hazardous chemicals.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Any environment degrading and polluting industries would not require a licence but an administrative clearance from the respective ministries of central/state government before investment. Further, as a part of liberalization there was now no restrictions on capacity expansion and diversification by the private companies. The policy thus allowed the private sector to operate as pure businesses with minimal bureaucratic control and be driven and expand operations largely by demands in the markets and opportunities available.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Why was this done? It is important to understand that even before reforms, despite the regulations, the private sector struggled, operated within the constraints of the government but survived and was not completely eclipsed by the public sector. The changing economic scenario required a different orientation focused on efficiency, productivity and profitability.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">A time had come to acknowledge maturity of the private sector, their resilience, their fighting spirit and that they could now share and shoulder larger responsibilities. In fact, on the contrary, the regulations had given them the maturity of operating in a constrained environment.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It also distinguished a fundamental shift in the mindset of the government of theclear distinction between production and governance, and a separate role for both the private sector as well as the government. It also marked the shifting of responsibility of incremental investment and growth to the private sector, leaving the government freer to concentrate on addressing the larger social issues of the economy and better governance . It was also an acknowledgement of the objective of a mixed economy . It should not be seen as undermining the importance of the public sector but giving due credibility to the private sector in the economy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Public Sector and Economic Reforms</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">It is widely perceived that the policy of 1991 has clipped the wings of the public sector by opening the areas which are reserved exclusively for public sector to private sector. This is not from a negative sense, but there would be a larger role for the private sector in the areas which were reserved earlier for the public sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The policy of 1991 reduced the areas reserved for public sector from 18 to 5 and subsequently in later years more sectors were thrown open for private sector participation, except for atomic energy, railways and those requiring a licence. Further, no new public sector would be set up and investment limited to existing companies and that to from the internal accruals or  accumulated profits  of  public  sector.  No  fresh  budgetary allocations would be made in public sector except for loss-making and ‘stressed’ public sector companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There was a requirement for greater professional character by the public sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Appointments to the Board of Directors of public sector would only be of professionals . The Chief Executives of public sector were made accountable for their performance . Performing public sectors were to be given greater autonomy in their day-to-day operations. First through the concept of execution of Memorandum of Understanding of commitments of performance and operational flexibility . Later giving status of Maharatna , Navrattan and Mininavrattan , of varying degree of taking investment decisions to well run PSUs.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The policy has taken a complete ‘U’ turn from the previous policies, in announcing that there would be no further nationalization of the private sector unless there are compelling exceptional circumstances.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">On the contrary, the policy for the first time, talked of disinvestment and privatization of public sector. The third element of the New Economic Policy was the reforms in foreign investment which will be discussed in a later section.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Disinvestment and Privatization</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Both disinvestment as well as privatization is the reverse of investment. For setting up public sector, the government had to invest by subscribing in shares of the new public sector from budgetary resources. Thus, disinvestment and privatization both imply ‘selling of shares of public sector by the government’. We all know that shares are traded at the stock market and the traded value of each share is decided by the buyers and the sellers in the market.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">If buyers of shares of a particular company are more than the sellers of the same, the traded value of the shares would be at a premium’ or otherwise it would be at a ‘discount’. Thus, in both the cases of disinvestment as well as privatization, selling of shares of public sector would be at a premium.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">To distinguish between both, ownership of companies would need to be understood. Who is the owner of a company? He/She is a person who holds majority of the shares, that is, 51 per cent. Technically, ownership is with the person holding a minimum 51 per cent shares, or even a person enjoying support of 51 per cent shareholders. This can be explained as: If you are holding 10 per cent shares of a company and you are able to convince 41 per cent shareholders to support, then you will become the owner of the company (similar as governments are formed). Hence, disinvestment is defined as selling of shares of public sector at a premium, to the public, by the government without losing ownership of the public sector. The objective here is to raise resources for the government. These shares are sold to the public as the preferred and first option of making them partners in public sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">We have talked about ownership earlier. At a still deeper level ownership of businesses being done, as companies having shares, is always with shareholders and management is with the person having support of 51% of the shareholders. Privatization is transferring management control to the private sector by selling 51 per cent shares of public sector to the private sector or even lesser but transferring management control to a group or to a company. The objective is not so much to raise resources in as much as transferring management control from the government to the private company. It is not a logical extension of disinvestment. That is, having disinvested in a public sector does not necessarily imply that it is going to be privatized.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Why did the policy of 1991 favored privatization? The policy took a mature decision in seeking privatization of the public sector for the following reasons:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) The public sector as mentioned earlier had broadly delivered in terms of creating significant capacities in key areas such as self-reliance, substituting for import of industrial goods, created the platform for further industrialization and industrial growth. There is a requirement now to moving into higher gears and look at issues such as developing greater capabilities, improving productivity and efficiency, sharp focus on profitability.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) The policy of liberalization has opened the gates for liberal private sector investment in key areas and competition would only intensify. This requires the public sector to now run as pure businesses, as a commercial venture which is possible solely in private sector. As a public sector, there will always be a limitation of not being to operate as a pure business in the same way as their counter pans in the private sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) The role of the government as a producer of industrial goods is always interim, short-term and never permanent. It can be permanent producer only of those where direct welfare of people is affected like railways or in the national interest like atomic energy.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) It is also about the mindset of the government of the maturity of the private sector and their ability to deliver the requirements better than the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) As a government, it has larger responsibilities of providing good and efficient governance, creating enabled environment, addressing the welfare of the masses, which are far more important than running public sector. Especially, when today there is a maturity and competence in the private sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) Why privatize a profit making public sector? Privatization is not about profit making but for a larger reason of whether it will continue to remain profitable in future with intense and fierce competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) Thus, privatization is not for today but for a brighter future of the public sector in a privatized environment equipped better to meet the challenges.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(8) Any business requires the ability to take prompt business decisions, it is not about whether the decision was right or wrong. Such decisions will always have business risks but what is required is the ability to take the decision quickly. The structure of public sector globally is such that it suffers from delays in decision-making.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(9) Privatization is also about handing public sector to a visionary’ who understands business, understands priorities and knows how to make the public sector grow to greater heights and help it to emerge as a global company.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Keeping the above facts in view the government went for some big ticket privatization like that of BALCO (Vedanta Group), VSNL (Tatas), IPCL (Reliance Industries), Modern Foods (Unilever), and Maruti (Suzuki). Even Round 1 of privatization was performed amidst lot of controversy ranging from the need to issues of valuation.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Why the opposition to privatization? The reasons are detailed as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) It was feared that government owned monopolies would be replaced by private sector monopolies and could result in exploitation by the private sector. The government has clarified that no public sector operating as a monopoly would be privatized. Only those which are operating in a competitive environment would be privatized. Until they are able  to  operate  in a competitive environment there would only be disinvestment of such public sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) It is also feared that privatization would result in a large number of workers laid off or would lose their jobs thereby adding to the pool of unemployment. It needs to be understood that public sector being specialized in nature, the workers by virtue of experience have acquired a skill set which no owner would like to lose. Rather than retrench they would be redeployed.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) It is also widely believed that proceeds received from disinvestment and privatization would be used to meet the budgetary deficit and not used for the benefit of the masses or used to create social assets in the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) The government has already set up the National Investment Fund (NIF) for parking of funds received from disinvestment.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) Further, the corpus would not be used but the returns from the corpus by their investment in profitable avenues, would be used 75 per cent for creating social assets and the remaining 25 per cent in revival of loss making public sector units and also meeting the expansion needs of the profitable public sector units.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(c) The corpus of the NIF would be managed by UTI mutual fund, SBI and LIC.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Given the high level of fiscal deficit it would be difficult for the government to desist from reducing the deficit through proceeds of disinvestment and privatization.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite the merit and the need for privatization the government rightfully is not considering any  further privatization  and  would rather wait for consensus building amongst political parties, trade unions before privatization as it is a long protracted process spanning several decades.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Both liberalization as well as privatization are the major planks of the economic reforms. The government by pressing the ‘pause button&#39; on privatization is being criticized as slowing down of reforms or of having gone ‘soft’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;    text-align:justify; ">Privatization should not be seen as the only aspect of reforms. Neither should one expect</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align:justify; ">an end of all economic problems through privatization. A similar misplaced belief was there</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">when public sector was set up. Privatization at its best provide only for an efficient and competitive domestic industrial base and cannot be said as the ‘only’ aspect of reforms. There are so many other softer reforms (relatively easy to implement through an executive order of the government), which could have been done. Despite the policy of liberalization there are still bureaucratic hurdles.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In terms of World Bank survey , on the relative ease of doing business outside government approval, regulatory clearances, India’s rank is a low of one hundred and thirty-four out of one hundred and eighty -three countries . Singapore is ranked as number one among all other countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Similarly, ‘Licence Raj’ has paved way to ‘Inspector Raj’. Today, as many as thirty different inspectors visit the factory premises under various Acts as against 2-3 in China. Getting an electricity connection or a no objection certificate from pollution control board is still difficult. Collection of excise duty is cumbersome.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There is still a lot of bureaucratic interface for performing business in India and that is where the government needs focusing. Thus, liberalization has helped but not to that level by global standards. It is rightly said that what India needs is ‘thousands of smaller reforms’ and ‘big bang reforms’ can wait till acceptable or till a need for them is felt.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part50.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part52.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
