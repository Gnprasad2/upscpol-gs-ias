The major developments relating to India’s external debt as at end-September 2018 are presented below.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Highlights</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">At end-September 2018, India’s external debt witnessed a decline of 3.6 per cent over its level at end-March 2018, on account of a decrease in commercial borrowings and non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits. The decrease in the magnitude of external debt was primarily due to valuation gains resulting from the appreciation of the US dollar against the Indian rupee and major currencies. The external debt to GDP ratio stood at 20.8 per cent at end-September 2018, higher  than its level  of 20.5 per  cent  at end-March 2018. (The ratio is based on external debt and GDP valued in rupee terms.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Major highlights pertaining to India’s external debt at end-September 2018 are presented below:</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">• At end-September 2018, India’s external debt was placed at USS 510.4 billion, recording a decrease of USS 19.3 billion over its level at end-March 2018 .</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">• Valuation gains due to the appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Indian rupee and major currencies (viz., SDR, yen, euro, and pound sterling) were placed at USS</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">25.4 billion. Excluding the valuation effect, the increase in external debt would have been USS 6.1 billion instead of a decrease of USS 19.3 billion at end- September 2018 over end-March 2018.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• Commercial borrowings continued to be the largest component of external debt with a share of 37.1 per cent, followed by NRI deposits (23.9 per cent) and short- term trade credit (19.9 per cent).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• At end-September 2018, long-term debt (with original maturity of above one year) was placed at USS 406.1 billion, recording a decline of USS 21.4 billion over its level at end-March 2018.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">• The share of long-term debt (original maturity) in total external debt at end- September 2018 was 79.6 per cent, lower than its level of 80.7 per cent at end- March 2018.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• The share of short-term debt (with original maturity of up to one year) in total external debt increased to 20.4 per cent at end-September 2018 from 19.3 per cent at end-March 2018. The ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to foreign</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">exchange reserves increased to 26.1 per cent at end-September 2018 (24.1 per cent at end-March 2018).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">• Short-term debt on a residual maturity basis (i.e., debt obligations that include long-term debt by original maturity falling due over the next twelve months and short­</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">term debt by original maturity) constituted 43.8 per cent of total external debt at</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">end-September 2018 (42.0 per cent at end-March 2018) and stood at 55.8 per cent of foreign exchange reserves (52.3 per cent at end-March 2018) (Table 2).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• US dollar denominated debt continued to be the largest component of India’s external debt with a share of 49.7 per cent at end-September 2018, followed by the Indian rupee (36.1 per cent), SDR (5.3 per cent), yen (4.7 per cent) and euro (3.2 per cent).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• The borrower-wise classification shows that the outstanding debt of both government and non-governmcnt sectors decreased at end-September 2018 (Table 3).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• Debt service payments declined to 6.5 per cent of current receipts at end- September 2018 as compared with 7.5 per cent at end-March 2018 (Table 4) - reflecting lower repayments of external commercial borrowings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">India’s external debt has remained within manageable limits as indicated by the external debt indicators, and the country is not among the world’s top debtors . The prudent external debt management policy of the government has helped contain the rise in external debt and maintaining a comfortable external debt debt position.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">International comparison based on World Bank’s ‘International Debt Statistics 2017’ indicates that India continues to be among the less vulnerable nations and India’s main external debt indicators compare well with other indebted developing countries. India’s key debt indicators, especially external debt to GNI, debt service ratio and short-term debt to total external debt continue to be comfortable indicating that our external debt is within manageable limits. Among developing countries, while China has the highest debt stock and the highest share of short term external debt to total external debt, its key debt indicators like total external debt to GNI, debt service ratio and foreign exchange cover for external debt are more favourable than the other developing countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Public Debt of India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">While India can draw comfort levels in terms of external debt, India also has a deeper internal problem of the high levels of rupee denominated debt comprising of government borrowings, petro oil bonds, etc. This taken together with external debt is known as ‘public debt’. Public debt to GDP ratio has continuously increased reaching almost 70 per cent.</p><p style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">A striking difference in the overall public debt of India in relation to other economies having similar magnitude  of public debt is the  fact  that in India  internal debt  accounts</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">for 90 per cent of public debt while external debt is only 10 per cent. In other similar economies, the component of external debt was of much higher levels making them more susceptible to crisis than India.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Though high internal debt is preferable to high external debt but not without its implications on domestic liquidity, inflation ultimately threatening long-term sustainability of growth. The government has made conscious efforts at fiscal consolidation but the crisis has taken its own toll in terms of fiscal concessions, increased levels of deficit to prevent the slowdown of growth. This may be understandable but the bigger challenge for the government would be to balance investment needs to increase growth rates and at the same time to keep deficits under check. This is easier said than done.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s97" style="padding-left: 121pt;text-indent: -3pt;    text-align: left;">EXCHANGE RATE DETERMINATION</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">CHAPTER</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">29</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part152.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part154.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
