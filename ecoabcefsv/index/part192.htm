They have been central government-driven in their area of domain. They have been discussed sector-wise in the previous sections, but are being revisited, co facilitate a greater cohesive comprehension.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Industrial sector reforms are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) The industrial policy of 1991 also known as the policy of liberalization marked the dismantling of the industrial licensing system, larger role for the private sector and</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">move towards a <span class="s31">competitive environment.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) This has allowed the expansion of the private sector, greater maturity and their presence in all sectors of the economy including core industries such as oil, power and other critical industries.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) (here has been diversification of the industrial base with a large number of industrial goods being produced.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) The public and private sector are now operating in a competitive environment bringing out the mixed economy character very clearly.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) The private sector post-reforms have helped to increase the industrial growth and lifted the overall plane of economic growth.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) The private sector has gone aggressively for global acquisitions helping them to emerge as global players in the international market. For example, Tata-Corus Jaguar, TCS, Videocon, ONGC, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) Public sector also has been given greater autonomy for operational flexibility in the competitive environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It has led to establishing India as a market economy with pricing of most industrial goods as market-determined, except for certain petro goods.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The increased production of private sector and their growth in the last two decades has been impressive leading to higher growth and also increased overall investments in the economy which will make a 10 per cent overall growth, a reality, in the not too distant future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Financial Sector Reforms</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The financial sector reforms in the banking sector was largely driven by the ‘Narasimham Committee’ recommendations which allowed for liberal entry of private and foreign banks letting for greater competition, diversified products and vastly improved services. Major areas of reform in the banking sector were as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) Liberal entry of private sector and foreign banks. It is as part of the reforms that today there arc also private sector banks operating along with the public sector banks.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) Public sector was given greater autonomy to function in a competitive environment and frame-independent policies based on broad framework provided by RBI.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Interest rates both the deposits as well as advances were deregulated and each bank was free to decide on the interest rates it chose to offer.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Similarly, in respect of lending rates while banks were free to decide on the interest rate they would charge, they had to publish the lowest rate of interest. They would charge to their best clients known as the benchmarked prime lending rate (BPLR).</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">More recently during 2010, RBI has asked the banks to adopt the base rate  of interest, and that no lending would be done by banks below their respective published base rate of interest.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) Banking was made more transparent, stress on full disclosure of both the good as well as bad assets.</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) There was standardization and uniform income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms for the banking sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">For the first time, a uniform definition was given to non-performing assets (NPAs)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">known as the 90 days norms. Thus, interest on loans given if not received within the stipulated time period would need to be classified as an NPA.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) Realizing that banking is risky business having normal risks in lending and to</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">safeguard interest banks were required to adhere to ‘capital adequacy’ norms in terms of international best practices (more about this later in this section).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The overall objective was to bring in greater competition in the banking sector by allowing for better products and improved services and fine-tuned interest rates to support the financial needs of a growing economy like India and enable bigger banks in India to emerge as global banks. Insurance-sector reforms were driven by the ‘Malhotra Committee’ recommendations which, for the first time opened the insurance sector, even though partially, to the private sector, from the complete government-dominated insurance sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The insurance sector has been opened up 100 per cent for the private sector but restricted to 26 per cent equity participation for foreign insurance companies. Post-reforms a large number of insurance companies in the private sector have become operational in the country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tax Reforms</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">One of the  major aspects of reforms  has  been  in the  areas  of  taxation  of  moving  to  a Value-added Tax (VAT) system and conversion of the sales tax regime into homogenized state  VAT.  A  still  far  ambitious  reform which will provide for an  efficient indirect tax regime is moving to a uniform goods and services tax (GST). Similarly, the direct tax code once made operational would considerably simplify the direct tax system providing for far greater tax compliance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Trade Sector Reforms</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">However, the most profound impact has been through the trade sector reforms, an integral part of economic reforms much wider in nature.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(a) These reforms has given the clear signal of opening the economy and larger role for exports, capital flows and a competitive, efficient and productive domestic economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">(b) More specifically, reforms covered moving towards a market-determined exchange</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">rate, replacing FERA with FEMA, current account convertibility and fairly open capital account and liberalized external commercial borrowings by the private sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(c) It also liberalized the foreign investment policy to attract foreign investment and eased restrictions on capital inflows.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(d) These measures have been largely responsible for increasing exports and increased share in global trade of goods and services.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(e) The external transactions arc now over 100  per cent of the GDP, built-up  foreign exchange reserves providing an import cover of over 7 months as against barely seven days during 1991.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">However, the most notable aspect of reforms has been the fact, that not only India got out of the crisis, not only repaid but prepaid its liabilities to the IMF and has turned as a ‘lender from a borrower’ to the IMF. It has earned the status of an emerging economy, changed the global perspective of India and now having a larger say in global matters. It</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">has emerged as the second fastest growing economy of the world after China, in a short time of just about two decades.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Labour Reforms.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Along with bringing transparency and accountability in enforcement of Labour Laws, the Government has taken various initiatives to realize and establish the dignity of every worker through provision of social security, enhancing the avenues and quality of employment along with industrial development. Recent major reforms are:</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Introduction of Labour Codes: <span class="p">In line with recommendations of Second National Commission on Labour, the Government has taken steps for formulating of four Labour Codes on (i) Wages; (ii) Industrial Relations; (iii) Social Security &amp; Welfare; and (iv) Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions by amalgamating, simplifying, and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Launching of Shram Suvidha Portal: <span class="p">The Government has developed a unified Web Portal ‘Shram Suvidha Portal’, to bring transparency and accountability in enforcement of labour laws and ease complexity of compliance.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 <span class="p">which came into force from 1st April 2017: Increased paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks and has benefited 18 Lakh women employees. Recently Government proposed to bear 7 weeks of salary to motivate employers. &#39;This policy will be finalised after approval by the competent forum.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 <span class="p">which came into force from 1st April 2017: Increased paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks and has benefited 18 Lakh women employees.

This policy will be finalised after approval by the competent forum.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">&#39;The Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill, 2018 <span class="p">passed by Lok Sabha on 15th March, 2018 and by the Rajya Sabha on 22nd March, 2018, has been brought in force on 29th March, 2018. The present upper ceiling on gratuity amount under the Act has been raised from Rs. 10 Lakh, to Rs. 20 Lakhs.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Atal BimitVyakti Kalyan Yojana: <span class="p">Considering the change in employment pattern and the current scenario of employment in India which has transformed from a long term employment to short term engagement in form of contract and temping, the ESI Corporation has approved a Scheme named “ATAL BIMITVYAKTI KALYAN YOJANA” for Insured Persons (IPs) covered under the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948. This scheme is a relief payable in cash directly to their Bank Account in case of unemployment and while they search for new engagement.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">“UMANG: ESIC - Chinta Se Mukti” Mobile App: <span class="p">IP centric information services are now made available through ‘ESIC - Chinta Se Mukti ’ mobile app launched through UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) platform.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Where the Economic Reforms Have Not Delivered?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">What we have just covered is the positive side of the reforms, however, it also has shades of grey areas which is a matter of concern.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) The overall growth even though higher from the past and also in relation to other economies, has been fairly uneven, or exclusive but not inclusive.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) The benefits of growth have been confined to few not broad-based to benefit the masses.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) It is not led to the desired degree of expansion in employment opportunities, normally associated with, high levels of growth. Employment in the manufacturing sector has stagnated.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) The growth has been highly skewed, accentuating inter-state and intra-state inequalities. It has virtually left the (Bihar, MP, Assam, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh) states untouched.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) The ‘license Raj’ has been abolished but replaced by a bigger hindrance of the ‘inspector Raj’.</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) Bureaucratic control has solely changed its face has moved from direct to indirect such as pollution control boards, environmental clearances, etc.</p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">(7)</p><p class="s71" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(8)</p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Levy and collection of excise duties is still complex.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The earlier nexus between the politics and business, despite the reform process, has</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">only got stronger.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">The above has not happened essentially because the government has virtually pressed the ‘pause’ button of economic reforms with a large unfinished agenda of:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) The government could be said to have gone ‘soft’ on bolder reforms. Labour market reform, which is not even being considered by the government, despite it being fundamental, in the changed circumstances and to provide the much needed link between growth and employment opportunities.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) Further, unshackling the private sector from the myriads of indirect interface with the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Bringing on board the state governments to share the passion of driving the reforms deeper across states.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Pushing through to make the NCLT functional at the earliest as it is one of the components of an exit policy, seen as a facilitator to the process of liberalization.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) Privatization has virtually been put on the back burner with only disinvestment in public sector being considered. This is a retrograde step and at least a platform should be created for building a broad-based consensus.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) Loss-making public sector continues to act as a drain and no efforts made to see how they can be integrated in a liberalized market economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) The banking sector despite reforms is largely dominated by the public sector and no efforts at their consolidation or privatization for their long-term sustainability.</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(8) Efforts at reforms in the insurance sector have been half-hearted, with the dominance of the government, despite the fact that insurance in market is fairly under developed and lacking penetration.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">(9) The FDI policy still has a number of structural issues and potential road blocks</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">to foreign investment. FDI in organized retail, raising sectoral caps for insurance business by foreign companies are key aspects of reforms.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part191.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part193.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
