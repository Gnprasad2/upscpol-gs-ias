Export Oriented Units and Software Technology Park Scheme: <span class="p">The key features of Export Oriented Units and Software Technology park scheme are:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;">(i) EOUs and STPs have been allowed to share infrastructural facilities among themselves. This will enable units to utilise their infrastructural facilities in an optimum way and avoid duplication of efforts and cost to create separate infrastructural facilities in different units.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(ii) Inter unit transfer of goods and services have been allowed among EOUs and STPs. This will facilitate group of those units which source inputs centrally in order to obtain bulk discount. This will reduce cost of transportation, other logistics costs and result in maintaining effective supply chain.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -23pt;    text-align: justify;">(iii) EOUs have been allowed facility to set up warehouses near the port of export. This will help in reducing lead time for delivery of goods and will also address the issue of unpredictability of supply orders.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -22pt;    text-align: left;">(iv) STP units, EHTP units, software EOUs have been allowed the facility to use all duty free equipment/goods for training purposes. This will help these units in developing skills of their employees.</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(v) 100 percent EOU units have been allowed facility of supply of spares/ components up to 2 percent of the value of the manufactured articles to a buyer in domestic market for the purpose of after-sale services.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -22pt;    text-align: justify;">(vi) Time period for validity of Letter of Permission (LOP) for EOUs/EHTP/STPI/ BTP units has been revised for faster implementation and monitoring of projects. Now, LOP will have an initial validity of 2 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -25pt;    text-align: justify;">(vii) A simplified procedure will be provided to fast track the de-bonding/exit of EOUs and STPs units. This will save time for these units and help in reduction of transaction costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The new foreign trade policy is based on the principle of simplicity as it had realigned multiple schemes into a single window&#39; and promoted increased use of technology to reduce transaction cost and manual compliances. The measures proposed in the policy&#39; are rational and in right direction to ensure the growth of India’s share in international trade.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part134.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part136.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
