On production side, the production pattern changes along with changes in technology and innovations in the system leading to change in the consumption pattern over time. The changes in relative prices stimulate changes in the consumption and production choices. Therefore, to account for these structural changes and to update the prices, the rebasing exercise is needed after a certain period. The exercise of rebasing national accounts brings up a fresh lot of information about the changes in economic structure of the  economy, along with switching over to new base prices. This also helps in judging the size of the economy, correction of biases and looking afresh at the relative importance of sectors in the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The recent introduction of new series of National Accounts by Central Statistics Office (CSO) revised the base year for National Accounts Statistics to 2017-18 form 2011-12</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The new series of national accounts is an improvement upon old base in terms of its comprehensive coverage of  corporate sector  and  government  activities  and incorporation of recent data generated through National Sample Surveys. It also brings up some changes in methods of evaluation, approaches to account economic activities, introduced new concepts and incorporation of new classifications.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Earlier “GDP at factor cost” was known as simply the “GDP” in India. It is nothing but sum of the factor costs incurred during the process of turning out economy’s output for the concerned year. Thus, it is a compilation of wages, interests, salaries, profits etc. This concept - GDP at factor cost - used to be expressed both in constant prices (with 2004-05 prices as the base year prices) and current prices. For most purposes, including academic works, GDP at factor cost in  constant prices was used as “GDP”. Further by adding net indirect taxes (ie. product taxes - product subsidies), GDP at market prices was also reported in the National Account Statistics.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In the revised series, as is the practice internationally, industry-wise estimates are presented  as  Gross  Value  Added  (GVA)  at basic prices,  while  “GDP at market prices” will be referred to as “GDP”. GVA at basic prices can be referred to as GVA at producer price and GDP at market price as well as GDP at buyer price. Estimates of GVA at factor cost (earlier called GDP at factor cost) can be compiled by using the estimates of GVA at basic prices and production taxes less subsidies. It would result in an effect on the size of GVA compared to GDP at factor cost, which may  be different for different sectors. For example,  net production  tax being positive  in manufacturing  would  result in  higher GVA than GDP in the sector. New growth figures for GVA at basic prices would also carry an impression of tax and subsidies which was not the case in GDP at factor cost. The production tax has been distinguished from product tax. For example: production taxes like land revenues, stamps and registration fees and tax on profession etc. and excise tax, sales tax, service tax and import and export duties etc. are included in product tax. A similar distinction is also made between production and product subsidies, for instance, former includes subsidies to railways, input subsidies to farmers, subsidies to village and small industries, administrative subsidies to corporations or cooperatives etc. and latter includes food, petroleum and fertilizer subsidies, interest subsidies given to farmers, households etc. through banks and subsidies for providing insurance to households at lower rates etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">GDP at market prices, henceforth, be referred as GDP, can be computed by adding net of product tax and product subsidies in GVA at basic prices.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: left;">• Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices = Compensation of Employees + Operating Surplus + Mixed Income + Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) + Production taxes</p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">- Production subsidies</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: left;">• GVA at factor cost (earlier referred to as GDP at factor cost) = GVA at basic prices - (Production taxes - Production subsidies)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -12pt;    text-align: left;">• Gross Domestic Product (GDP) = GVA at basic prices + Product taxes - Product subsidies</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In manufacturing, many argue that the output was falling but the new series showed that the manufacturing sector’s performance was not that bad. It was because although the output was stagnant or less but the value addition was better off. GDP is a measure of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">value added, it’s not about output. It’s the case of output being stagnant but value-addition going up.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Earlier the sectoral manufacturing data value addition was sourced from the RBI</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Industrial Outlook Survey conducted on a quarterly basis; but now the Ministry or Corporate Affairs making it obligatory on the part of the companies registered under the Companies Act for online reporting, the MCA 21 database has been used for the manufacturing sector value added. The MCA database as on date covers 5 lakh companies and is  fairly  representative  of  the universe. The RBI surveys are small  in size and  not completely reliable for the sectoral analysis. Further, the manufacturing value added was calculated from ASI Annual data and extrapolated using IIP for the intervening period. The limitation with this data was that the ASI and IIP are establishment-based data while the MCA database goes beyond establishment based value addition and also incorporates data on brand pricing, marketing etc i.e. it includes allied activities which were earlier outside the purview of manufacturing value added. Further, the corporate segment manufacturing coverage accounts for almost 66-70 percent of the manufacturing sector. Then the new series data collected from local bodies is also used and the coverage is 60 percent.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The valuables’ segment, which basically comprises of gold and jewellery, an important component of capital formation, was treated as consumption. In new series, valuables are combined into household savings and, therefore, consumption has come down and savings have gone up accordingly. The new GDP numbers will be liable to changes in future based on change in base year of IIP WPI and CPI series. These are important indices which play a pivotal role when computing GDP at constant and current prices. Based on revisions of base year of these indices, GDP growth rates may change.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The reasons for the rise in growth for manufacturing sector at new base are structural as well as change in compilation methodology. These are highlighted below:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">1. <span class="s9">The shift from establishment approach to enterprise approach: </span>The establishment approach used in Annual Survey of Industries did not capture the activities of a unit other than manufacturing. Whereas, an enterprise along with its manufacturing activities is also engaged in activities other than manufacturing such as ancillary activities. Now, in the new approach, the activities of a manufacturing company other than manufacturing are accounted in manufacturing sector. The enterprise approach is facilitated by MCA 21 data with Ministry of Corporate Affairs. These changes possibly have increased the coverage of registered sector of manufacturing.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">2. <span class="s9">Incorporation of findings of NSSO surveys: </span>The details of new NSS Surveys viz. Unincorporated Enterprises Surveys (2010-11) and Employment &amp; Unemployed Survey, 2011-12, are now available therefore, incorporated in the new series. The updates are an improvement in the representation of activities in the unorganized manufacturing sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -17pt;    text-align: justify;">3. <span class="s9">The change in labour input method: </span>The new series has switched over to “Effective Labour Input Method” for Unincorporated Manufacturing &amp; Services Enterprises.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Earlier method was assigning equal weights to all types of workers, while the new method assigns different weights for workers as per their productivity.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -16pt;    text-align: justify;">4. The inclusion of production tax less subsidies: <span class="p">The net of production tax and production subsidies is positive in manufacturing, while it is inter-alia negative in agriculture and allied’ and ‘Electricity, gas etc’. Therefore, the positive net production tax would increase the size of GVA in the sector in absolute and relative to other sectors. Moreover, any change, including a change in policy, if alters the lump sum production tax and subsidies then this may also likely to reflect in the growth rates in the sector.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">So we can say, the vast difference in the figures of the new series is not just because of an updation of the database or change in methodology but more so because of the change in data source. The new GDP numbers will be liable to changes in the future based on change in base year of IIP WPI and CPI series. These are important indices which play a pivotal role when computing GDP at constant and current prices. Based on revisions of base year of these indices, GDP growth rates may change.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part4.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part6.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
