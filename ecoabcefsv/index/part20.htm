It will also have landless, small and marginal farmers who are</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">engaged in casual work in the informal sector, living virtually on a daily basis. They are the most vulnerable section prone to exploitation, domination and do not have any voice or can also be known as ‘silent sufferers’ or a ‘mere spectator’ to their pitiable and pathetic condition oblivious of the fact that India is today one of the fastest growing economies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">One has  already seen earlier, why this has happened. But what has the Government done about this? It has adopted a three-pronged strategy to address the social sectors which are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">1.Broad Targeting; 2.Narrow Targeting; 3.Social Security.</p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Broad Targeting</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Under broad targeting strategies the government undertakes ambitious programs with sub-programes for overall and comprehensive development of the country.

Women are given preference for employment under this scheme, which has no middlemen or contractor and directly being implemented by the Gram Panchayats and the wages are paid in the bank account of those who are provided with the employment. The state governments are required to give unemployment allowance of one-third of the wages if not able to provide employment within 15 days of their registration. This scheme has been globally lauded as one of the most well intended schemes for the social sector anywhere in the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Critics of the scheme, however, feel that such a scheme could be damaging in the long run  by pushing  up the minimum wages and increase cost  in the agricultural as well as</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">urban areas, adversely affect productivity and also prevent migration of labour, besides fuelling inflation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Narrow Targeting</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The government is attempting narrow targeting which are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">1.

A few reasons for their failure are as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">• The Government has well-designed schemes. The question is not about intention but that of implementation of these schemes. There was not a proper identification of the targeted beneficiaries.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• There is also a lack of awareness of these schemes amongst the masses, given their illiteracy and ignorance.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• &#39;There is also an absence of any monitoring mechanism for the efficacy of such schemes or to know the end result. The focus is on increased outlays and new schemes but there is no mechanism of tracking down the outcome.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• It may be better to implement these programmes through NGOs after a strict screening process and also with proper checks and balances in place.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• There is a need to bring in an independent ‘social audit’ of these schemes not for fixing accountability but for plugging leakages, improving delivery so as to make the schemes effective and true to their intention for the overall benefit of the social sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• Today, there is an availability of modern technology which can be deployed for capturing information and creating a database which will enable a tracking mechanism for the target group and their reach and will be useful in refining the schemes in future.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">• Finally, the focus of the government has been on schemes, so many that they overlap with diffused focus and accountability at different levels.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The aspect of changing the orientation from schemes to the people in the villages could be a better strategy and it also leads to convergence of all the schemes. This could be done following the cluster approach’ which is implementing all the schemes starting from the most backward villages, bunched together as a cluster, for the schemes to be implemented</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">and ensuring their sustainability by transferring the onus of further development to the villages and then moving to another cluster.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">It would be the responsibility of the state government to monitor the functioning of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the cluster of villages that are assisted through the schemes. This would provide for better delivery of schemes, proper monitoring and also for sustainability of the efforts and will lead to fundamental changes as the needs of the villages would get assessed first and not the other way around. It will also enable the government to acquire an understanding of the resources required and then the government could look at various alternatives of implementing them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Right since Independence, these problems have persisted. It has also engaged the attention of successive governments but it has always been through increased outlays and new schemes which have been launched for them, year after year, but without tangible benefits. What is now required is to tackle them differently. A few suggestions have been provided earlier, not that they are bound to succeed, but will display the attitude of the government of willing to experiment to find long-lasting solutions to the vexed problems. The government has to keep in mind that it is not the resources which matter bur in their efficient spending, technology-enabled monitoring mechanism and being on the learning curve each year, reorienting and successfully addressing the needs of the social sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Let us also admit that the task is daunting but it has to be accomplished one way or the other, a major challenge for the governments both the centre and state collectively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part19.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part21.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
