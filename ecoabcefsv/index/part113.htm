NITI Aayog is the premier policy, ‘Think Tank ’ of the Government of India , providing both directional and policy inputs . While designing strategic and long term policies and programmes for the Government of</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India, NITI Aayog also provides relevant technical advice to the Centre and States.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The Government of India, in keeping with its reform agenda, constituted the NITI Aayog to replace the Planning Commission instituted in 1950. This was done in order to better serve the needs and aspirations of the people of India. An important evolutionary change from the past, NITI Aayog acts as the quintessential platform of the Government of India to bring States to act together in national interest, and thereby fosters Cooperative Federalism.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">At the core of NITI Aayog s creation are two hubs — Team India Hub and the Knowledge and Innovation Hub. The Team India Hub leads the engagement of states with the Central government, while the Knowledge and Innovation Hub builds NITI’s think-tank capabilities. These hubs reflect the two key tasks of the Aayog.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Niti Aayog&#39;s Functions</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The main functions of Niti Aayog are enlisted below:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To evolve a shared vision of national development priorities sectors and strategies with the active involvement of States in the light of national objectives.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To foster cooperative federalism through structured support initiatives and mechanisms with the States on a continuous basis, recognizing that strong States make a strong nation.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To develop mechanisms to formulate credible plans at the village level and aggregate these progressively at higher levels of government.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To ensure, on areas that are specifically referred to it, that the interests of national security are incorporated in economic strategy and policy.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To pay special attention to the sections of our society that may be at risk of not benefiting adequately from economic progress.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To design strategic and long term policy and programme frameworks and initiatives, and monitor their progress and their efficacy. The lessons learnt through monitoring and feedback will be used for making innovative improvements, including necessary mid-course corrections.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To provide advice and encourage partnerships between key stakeholders and national and international like-minded Think tanks, as well as educational and policy research institutions.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To create a knowledge, innovation and entrepreneurial support system through a collaborative community of national and international experts, practitioners and other partners.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• To offer a platform for resolution of inter-sectoral and inter departmental issues in order to accelerate the implementation of the development agenda.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: -13pt;    text-align: justify;">• To maintain a state-of-the-art Resource Centre, be a repository of research on good governance and best practices in sustainable and equitable development as well as help their dissemination to stake-holders.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">• To actively monitor and evaluate the implementation of programmes and initiatives, including the identification of the needed resources so as to strengthen the probability of success and scope of delivery.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">• To focus on technology upgradation and capacity building for implementation of programmes and initiatives.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">• To undertake other activities as may be necessary in order to further the execution of the national development agenda, and the objectives mentioned above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">NITI Aayog&#39;s Role</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">NITI Aayog has been entrusted with the role to co-ordinate ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ (called as SDGs). Moving ahead from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), SDGs have been evolved through a long inclusive process for achievement during 2016-2030.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The SDGs cover 17 goals and 169 related targets resolved in the UN Summit meet 25-27 September 2015, in which India was represented at the level of Hon’blc Prime Minister. These SDGs will stimulate, align and accomplish action over the 15-year period in areas of critical importance for the humanity and the planet.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The task at hand for NITI Aayog is not merely to periodically collect data on SDGs but to act proactively fructify the goals and targets not only quantitatively but also maintaining high standards of quality.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has already undertaken a parallel exercise of interaction with the ministries to evolve indicators reflecting the SDG goals and targets.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">To achieve these tasks, the draft mapping of the goals and targets as an initial step on proposed Nodal and other Ministries has been carried out in consultation with MoSPI.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Further, as an illustration, the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs),including the core of the core’, ‘core’ and optional’ Schemes being implemented by the States have been mapped along with some of the recent initiatives undertaken by the Central Government.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In addition, Ministries are implementing Central Sector Schemes and States are also implementing various State Schemes aligned with one or more SDGs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Vision, Strategy and Action</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The 15-year vision document has a seven-year strategy document for 2017-24 as the ‘National Development Agenda.’ Separately, a three-year Action Agenda from 2017-18 to 2019-20 is also under works to assess funding requirements. The three-year agenda is</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">further divided into seven parts, with a number of specific action points for each part to boost economic growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The 12<span class="s19">rh </span>five years plan has came to an end on March 31, 2017. The three-year action plan came into force from April 1, which will also end the prevailing system of the centre patiently waiting (for) the state governments to implement the schemes.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Niti Aayog has also been entrusted the work on the 15-year Vision Document and a seven year strategy, which would guide the government’s development work till 2030.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part112.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part114.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
