As an inward-looking economy,  with strong insulation from the rest of the World, FERA was to discourage foreign currency’ in domestic economy, and if required, be specific and thus need for regulations.</p><p style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Under FERA, there were very limited transactions which were permitted and that too after seeking approval there were a large number of transactions in the negative list or that transactions could not be done. Cross-border inflows and outflows were also restricted, in line with the levels of insulation of the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">All foreign-owned companies were designated as FERA companies. Similar to their counterparts in the domestic sector, MRTP companies under a similar act known as MRTP act. These companies in terms of their respective acts had to be closely monitored and regulated for fears of exploitative and unethical practices.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Foreign exchange regulation act also vested powers to try out criminal cases of violations in foreign exchange regulations. Thus, towards greater openness, and as a part of major trade sector reforms FERA was repealed and a new foreign exchange management act (FEMA) enacted in 1999, through which regulations paved way to management of foreign exchange transactions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Foreign exchange management act was more liberal in allowing transactions without restrictions and dramatically pruned the negative list of foreign exchange transactions. The basic idea was to permit’ rather than the earlier regime to ‘prevent’. It also eased restrictions on cross-border capital flows especially foreign investment providing a clear signal of lowering of insulation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In tandem, the then EXIM policies had already lowered peak-level customs duty to facilitate greater imports into the country. With the dismantling of both the MRTP as well as the FERA acts, nomenclature of FERA companies, MRTP companies were also discontinued. With a strong focus on management of foreign exchange, trying out of criminal offenses was entrusted to a separate newly created enforcement directorate (ED). Thus, FEMA essentially covers three broad areas which are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1) Rupee convertibility.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(2) Setting up of a separate ED for trying out criminal offenses in foreign exchange.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(3) Borrowings by the corporate sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Like the reforms in the industrial sector, replacing of FERA with FEMA is seen as a major aspect of trade reforms signifying relaxations on inflows and also greater openness of the Indian Economy. It is not only replacing ‘regulations’ with ‘management’,</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but a</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">other</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">paradigm shift in die governments outlook towards foreign currency. The major areas of trade sector reforms are in the areas of foreign investment</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">policy and also exchange rate determination, which are discussed in the subsequent sections.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part143.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part145.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
