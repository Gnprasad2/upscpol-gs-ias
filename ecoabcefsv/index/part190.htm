There is a need to integrate all the perspectives to see the Indian outlook in view of the rapidly changing global environment, into the future, tasks ahead</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">and the challenges before the economy . However , first , we also need to take stock of the economic reforms of the last two decades, which have been discussed, but in separate sections, being multi-sectoral in nature.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">As we had discussed the global transition, post-independence, the economic reforms of 1991 can be said to be  transition towards a  newer India,  shift  in  the  outlook  and a different orientation from the previous inward-looking to outward-looking. It is also a reflection of the mood of the government of greater faith in the market and private players and their larger role in the economy. Here, an attempt is being made to provide a holistic and comprehensive review of the economic reforms initiated since 1991.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Even though it is widely believed that 1991 was the beginning of reforms in India, reforms dare back to previous years. However, these were piece meal, specific and micro­ oriented and were witnessed more as changes’ rather than reforms. The policy of 1991 marked the character of changes’ changing to ‘reforms’, reflecting a distinct priority and documented as a policy not done earlier.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other aspect of the reform is that they were largely initiated by the BOP crisis, necessitating pledging of gold by India and the resultant loan from the IMF, which has led to the initiation of economic reforms of 1991. Economic reforms are the process, the commencement of a journey and is a continuous process, shifting gears and moving to next levels in the journey. As</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">an economy , this journey can never end and neither can reform . There can be a slowdown , a</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pause, but eventually would have to be resumed again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part189.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part191.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
