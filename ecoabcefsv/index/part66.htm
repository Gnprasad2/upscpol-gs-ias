India in its initial years, post-independence, suffered from low savings and it resulted in low investments leading to low growth. India was believed to be caught in the low growth cycle and unable to break through this cycle, known as ‘Hindu rate of growth’ (refer to Chapter on Inclusive Growth). Investment was determined by the overall levels of savings and secondly the investment was largely by the government. Excess spending over and above savings, resulted in deficit in such economies.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It may be appropriate to define savings of an economy as the difference between income and consumption. It could be financial saving (money put in banks, government securities shares, bonds, debentures, insurance, pension funds, etc.,) but other than the cash held. The other is physical savings which could be assets such as real estate, gold and commodities.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Savings can be across household sector, corporate sector and even through the departmental undertaking of the government like Department of Posts, etc. However, more than 70 per cent of the savings is accounted for by the household sector. It can well be known that India is a ‘household sector savings driven economy’. The recent increase in saving, post reforms, is known as a ‘macro-economic fundamental strength of India’.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Investment in the macro-economic framework implies increase in capital (machinery) stock, known as gross capital formation and after accounting for depreciation (usage of machine), as net capital formation. Growth can only be increased with capital formation</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">and thus, the importance of investments in an economy. For example, if Maruti decides to set up* a new plant leading into production of more cars, and increase in GDP, it will also lead to greater employment and increased income for the people.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">What investment model has been followed by India in the past?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Traditionally, there were two models of investment ‘top down investment’ and the other as ‘bottom up investment’. The first model is to invest in basic, capital and core industries such as crude oil, steel, cement, power generation, etc. This would lead to investment in other industries and finally investment in consumer goods which would then drive more investment in the core industries. The other focuses more on small and village industries and then allowing for their scalability to higher and more capital intensive investment over a certain period of time.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India opted for the first investment model post-independence as a part of the second five-year plan through the new concept of investment through public sector (refer to Chapter on Planning in India).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Pre-reforms investment was through public sector being set up in the core areas, through budgetary allocation. The objectives were of increasing significant capacities in critical areas, achieve self-reliance and become a driver of industrialization and increase overall  growth of the  economy (refer to  Chapter on Industrial  Sector). Such  investment can be known to be basic capital expenditure or as ‘core investment.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What were the limitations of the earlier public sector-led investment?</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: left;">First, India in the past was characterized by low savings resulting in low-levels of investment and thus low growth. Secondly, the government always had a binding resource constraint arising out of increased social sector spending, increased subsidy on food grains, fertilizers, etc. The government was not able to raise tax revenue in the economy resulting in an ever increasing fiscal deficit (refer to Chapter on Government Finances).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thirdly, government is an inefficient spender in the economy especially in capital formation as there is time overrun in completion of projects which results in cost overruns and higher cost of projects. This results in ‘capital deepening’, increasing capital intensity but not allowing for ‘capital efficiency’.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Fourthly, the focus of earlier investment was on ‘creation of capacities’ in different areas through ‘available technologies’ in India or technologies from other economies following a similar investment model like erstwhile USSR.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Fifthly, this model allowed for capital formation but in a limited manner and not technology and knowledge intensive’ driven investment.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Sixthly, with the lack of focus on profits and with other social responsibilities, public sector did not have sufficient resources to augment investment in die economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Finally, as a closed and regulated economy there were no alternatives to savings and public sector investment.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part67.htm">11.2 NEO-INVESTMENT MODELS</a><a class="toc0" href="part68.htm">PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP MODEL (PPP)</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part65.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part67.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
