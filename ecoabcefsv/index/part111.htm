With just having becoming an independent country, objective was on increasing agricultural sector growth and balance development while keeping inflation under check. Being the first plan, targets were fairly modest and emphasis was on consolidation.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It was from thesecond five-year plan (1956 -1957 to 1960 -1961 ) that planning in the true form acquired shape of vision of India, need for an industrial base and the resultant initiation of industrialization . This was also known as the Mahalanobis model, used in the second five-year plan, which was creating significant capacities in both capital as well as core industries by the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The emphasis of this model was on achieving self-reliance and also the ability to meet the needs of the domestic economy. This plan is known for a top-down industrialization of the big industries creating a base for the growth of medium and small-scale industries and going down to village and cottage industries. It also gave birth to the concept of public sector of state run enterprises based on the Russian model of industrialization. Public sector was also envisioned as to meet broad socio-welfare objectives in the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Most of the public sector in India was set up during this plan period and also known as the industrialization or the public sector plan. With the first plan target for overall growth surpassed the second plan which had set out an ambitious target of 4.5 per cent for the five-year period, but managed only an average growth of 3.9 per cent during the plan period.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The third five-year plan (1961-1962 to 1965-1966) had proposed a larger thrust on industrialization but the war with China and subsequently Pakistan, quite destabilized</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">the third plan because of the changing priorities of the war, and resulted in a plan holiday from 1966-1967 to 1968-1969. Towards the end of the third plan, the plan holiday had a great contribution in ushering in the green revolution which increased the productivity of crops like wheat by using high-yielding varieties of seeds.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The fourth plan (1969-1970 to 1973-1974) was rebuilding the economy with the scarce resources that had got diverted towards war and aimed at growth with stability, greater self-reliance especially in defence, as a fall out of the war and increased vulnerability of more such wars in the future.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The fifth plan (1974-1975 to 1978-1979) for the first time actually addressed the issue of removal of poverty as a prime objective.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, it was sixth plan (1980—1981 to 1984-1985), it was realized that the growth by itself was not sufficient, for one, they were not sufficiently high enough to address the larger issues of poverty in the country and the other being that there were structural rigidities. This plan made a frontal attack on poverty; when the then Prime Minister, late Smt. Indira Gandhi gave the slogan of <i>&#39;Garibi Hatao.</i></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It marks the transformation from allocating scarce resources in the economy, to welfare orientation with focus on specific programs for poverty alleviation. These were not new schemes, however, all different schemes were combined as one scheme and known as the Integrated rural development programme (IRDP). It was the first plan to focus on gender issues, women empowerment and the growing inequalities amongst the states and also intra-regional imbalances.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">From Pl  to  P6 five-year  plan,  they  were  directed  plans  as there  was  a  large role of public sector and substantially larger investment by the government or the government could ensure investment in specific areas as it was the major investor. The general overtone in these five-year plans was towards industrialization, setting up of the public sector, self- reliance and establishing India as a self-generating economy, to provide employment and  meeting the needs of the economy, rather than they  being provided directly  by the government. Towards P5 and more  in  P6,  poverty&#39;  and welfare  orientation  of  the plans became visible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Indicative Planning (P7 onwards)</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The seventh plan (1985—1986 to 1989-1990) had two important aspects, one that of, larger agricultural sector orientation of increasing production and productivity and the second that of, a steady decline in the public sector investment falling to below 50 per cent of the total outlay, implying a larger contribution from private sector in the total outlay of the plan.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It was the plan which recorded the highest ever agricultural and overall growth of 10.4 per cent in 1988-1989; however, this was largely due to the lower base of the previous year with a growth of only 3.8 per cent. It has experienced for the first time, a problem of imports</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">outstripping the exports resulting in a balance of payment crisis in the country requiring India</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">to seek loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This is further discussed in detail in a separate section on the same subject.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">These adverse developments again forced the government to opt for a plan holiday from</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">1990 to 1992. As in the previous plan period, even this resulted in the launch of economic reforms also known as the New Economic Policy 1991, which has been discussed earlier in the section on public sector. Each successive plan after P7 has seen a phased reduction in public sector outlay and larger levels of private sector, changing planning from ‘directed to indicative’, which is, indicating which sectors require investment in terms of priorities and private sector expected to make that investment.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The eighth plan (1992-1993 to 1996-1997), besides the objectives of increasing growth, agricultural production mentioned the need for attaining self-sufficiency* in food grains. It, for the first time, brought the need for strengthening infrastructure especially in the areas of energy, transport, communications and energy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It was the first plan to have universal elementary education and eradication of illiteracy in the age group of 15-35 years as a major objective . This plan was also the first to have people initiative and participation in education , literacy , family planning , land development , irrigation, etc., also the need to rap voluntary agencies for meeting the needs of the social sector. The private sector investment was increased to 55 per cent, playing a larger role in mining , communication, electricity and gas. The role of public sector was seen now as selective.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The ninth plan (1997-1998 to 2001-2002), was only a further extension of the earlier plan, but besides the focus on growth also to provide for social justice and equity in the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The tenth plan (2002-2003 to 2006-2007) became more ambitious in terms of wide-ranging objectives addressing each and every aspect of the economy but for one difference it gave a time frame for poverty reduction, elementary education, literacy and other such issues. It is in this plan that the Fiscal Responsibility Budget Management Act was enacted which set out time frame for reduction in fiscal and revenue deficit as part of fiscal consolidation.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The eleventh plan (2007-2008 to 2011-2012) has coined the concept of Inclusive growth which means the benefits of growth should be benefiting the masses. It has set out monitorable and quantifiable targets both for the centre as well as the states and has grouped the priority areas to be addressed by the government.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It was concerned with the growing divide across the economy and a specific mention of drawing the NE states into mainstream  development  of the economy. The eleventh plan</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">saw the lowest ever public sector outlay of 25 per cent with a private sector outlay of 75 per cent as against the previous policies having over 60 per cent outlay from the public sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It has also brought out the need for neo-liberal policies given the changing global dynamics and a changed face of the economy. It gave thrust to the public-private sector partnership model for infrastructural development in the economy. The mid-term appraisal has, however, scaled the original-targeted rate of growth because of the global recession during 2008-2009. It has also mentioned that most sectors were on track as visualized and by the end of the plan there should be performance of an increased all round performance including the farm sector.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">INCLUSIVE GROWTH : THEME OF 12<span class="s90">t</span><span class="s76">h </span>PLAN</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Twelfth plan which covers years 2012 to 2017 focuses on instilling “inclusive growth&#39; . The plan is expected to be one that encourages the development of India’s agriculture, education, health and social welfare through government spending. It is also expected to create employment through developing India’s manufacturing sector and move the nation higher up the value chain.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The planning commission will strive to enact policies that will achieve somewhere around a 10% growth rate in factories and a 4% growth rate in farm produce, though Prime Minister has asked to set the nations growth rate firmly at 9 per cent to 9.5%.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">An important aspect of generating “inclusive growth” is shifting target of government aid to rural areas. Typically, large projects such as power generation, roads whereby freight can travel, and airports receive the lion’s share of government subsidies, while rural infrastructure receives comparatively little.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Rural infrastructure, which serves 70 per cent of the population, doesn’t get the attention it deserves. As the Planning Commission sets out to draft the country’s planned investments for the next five years, it is important to take note of this gap, and the innovative solutions needed to fill it.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Twenty five core monitorable targets of twelth five year plan focusing on objective of inclusive growth are as follows:</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Economic Growth</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Real GDP growth rate of 8.2 per cent.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Agriculture growth rate of 4.0 per cent.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• Manufacturing growth rate of 10.0 per cent.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Every State must have a higher average growth rate in the Twelfth Plan than that achieved in the Eleventh Plan.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Poverty and Employment</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Head-count ratio of consumption poverty to be reduced by 10 percentage points over the preceding estimates by the end of Twelfth Five Year Plan.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: left;">• Generate 50 million new work opportunities in the non-farm sector and provide skill certification to equivalent numbers during the Twelfth Five Year Plan.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Education</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Mean years of schooling to increase to seven years by the end of Twelfth Five Year Plan.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">• Enhance access to higher education by creating two million additional seats for each age cohort aligned to the skill needs of the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Eliminate gender and social gap in school enrollment (that is, between girls and boys , and between.
