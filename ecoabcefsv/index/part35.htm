It is the second largest producer of groundnuts, fruits and vegetables, which accounts for 10 per cent of the world’s fruits production and the country is leading in the production of mangoes and bananas. India is the world’s largest producer</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">of milk owing to the strong business models which are formed through cooperative movements in the country. Meat and poultry has also gained popularity due to the emergence of producers that have integrated breeding, feed milling, contract growing and marketing facilities which results in improved productivity. Meat, fish and poultry are in rural areas as they are easily affordable and provide necessary nutrients.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In recent years, there has been a shift from conventional farming of food grains to horticulture which includes fruits, vegetables, ornamental crops, medicinal and aromatic plants,  spices and plantation  crops  including coconut, cashew nuts and cocoa and  allied activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Nascent Food Processing</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite the agrarian strength of production in India, food processing industry is still in a nascent stage but holds tremendous potential to grow, considering the wide- ranging and large raw material base that the country offers, along with a consumer base of over one billion people. This industry holds tremendous opportunities for large investments and an untapped market. Even though India’s agricultural production base is reasonably strong, it has low productivity and is largely a livelihood activity. It is also characterized by high levels of wastage of over 35 per cent especially in fruits and vegetables.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Processing of fruits and vegetables is low 2 per cent, around 35 per cent in milk,</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">21 per cent in meat and 6 per cent in poultry products. By international comparison, these levels are significantly low—processing of agricultural produce is around 40 per cent in China, 30 per cent in Thailand, 70 per cent in Brazil, 78 per cent in the Philippines and 80 per cent in Malaysia. Value addition in agriculture produce in India is hardly 20 per cent.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other important aspect is organized sector which has very little presence and largely dominated by the unorganized sector. For example, in fruits and vegetables segment over 90 per cent is by the unorganized sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The food  processing  industry in India has a very small share of 1.5 per cent in the total GDP of the country and as a part of total manufacturing accounts for around</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">9 per cent. India’s share in world trade in respect of processed food is only about</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1.6 per cent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Potential of the Food Processing Industry</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Indian food industry is poised for a huge growth, increasing its contribution to world food trade every year. In India, the food sector has emerged as a high-growth and high- profit sector due to its immense potential for value addition, particularly within the food processing industry.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The food industry, which is currently valued at USS 39.71 billion, is expected to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11 per cent to US$65.4 billion by 2018. Food and grocery account for around 31 per cent of India’s consumption basket.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Accounting for about 32 per cent of the country’s total food market, The Government of India has been instrumental in the growth and development of the food processing</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">industry . The government through the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI ) is making all efforts to encourage investments in the business. It has approved proposals for joint ventures (JV), foreign collaborations, industrial licenses and 100 per cent export oriented units.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Indian food and grocery market is the worlds sixth largest, with retail contributing</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">to 70 per cent of the sales. Food has also been one of the largest segments in India’s retail sector, which was valued at USS 490 billion in 2013. The Indian food retail market is expected to reach Rs 61 lakh crore (USS 894.98 billion) by 2020.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">According to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the food processing sector has the potential to attract US $33 billion of investment in 10 years and can generate employment of 9 million person-days.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ministry for Food Processing Industries</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;

   text-align: justify;">• Taking advantage of the inherent ethnic tastes and food habits of the Indian consumer— this provides the local food players a distinct advantage over foreign entrants into the sector and poses an entry barrier for the latter.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Exploitation of the increasing consumerism fuelled by new job opportunities, larger disposable incomes and the emerging boom in modern retail trade.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• Opportunities for growth through the inorganic route, both domestically and outbound this would provide access to new product categories, brands, markets and new technologies.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• The SEZ/AEZ opportunity would also provide players an added incentive to develop green field projects within these zones and enjoy additional fiscal benefits.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• The Indian foods and beverage industry is poised for a significant leap forward—these are interesting times and continued success will depend on a proper understanding of the landscape and challenges therein, quickly exploiting emerging opportunities, skillful execution of strategic mergers and acquisitions and effecting a seamless organization to evolve into truly global players.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mega Food Park Scheme</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Highest priority has been accorded by the government for the development of infrastructure. The government has already taken several initiatives on this front which include developing of food parks, packaging centres, modernized abattoirs, integrated cold chain facilities, irradiation facilities and value added centres.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The initiative to develop food parks was taken primarily in order to assist the small and medium enterprises which are unable to invest in capital intensive activities. So far, twenty-two food parks have come into operation which provide common facilities such as cold storage, food testing and analysis labs.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The primary objective of the MFPS is to provide adequate/excellent infrastructure facilities for food processing along the value chain from the farm to market. It will include creation of infrastructure near the farm, transportation, logistics and centralized processing centres.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The main feature of the scheme is a cluster-based approach. The scheme will be demand- driven; pre-marketed and would facilitate food processing units to meet environmental, safety and social standards. The expected outcome results in increased realization for farmers, creation of high quality rural processing infrastructure, reduction in wastage, capacity building of the producers and processors and creation of an efficient supply chain along with significant direct and indirect employment generation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The scheme aims to facilitate the establishment of a strong food processing industry backed by an efficient supply chain, which would include collection centres, primary processing centres and cold chain infrastructure. The food processing units, under the scheme, would be located at a central processing centre (CPC) with requirements based on common infrastructure which are required for processing, packaging, environmental protection systems, quality control labs, trade facilitation centres, etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Urgency of Such Initiatives—Reasons</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">As mentioned earlier, it is because of the growing market largely because of increased income of people, rapid urbanization, changing demographics, movement away from joint families to nuclear families and increasing number of working women. The changing pace of life has marked a preference for processed food.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">These have resulted in shift in consumption driven by the processed food market, which is increasing and presently accounts for 32 per cent of the total food market and is likely to grow further only. The food processing industry is growing and has become one of the largest industries in India—it is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, export and expected growth.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Consumption patterns in India have been undergoing a visible shift. Earlier, the share of cereal products was the highest, followed by milk and milk products, vegetables, edible oil and meat products. However, in recent years, the growth rates for fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products have been higher than cereals and pulses. This shift in turn implies that there is also a need to diversify the food production base to match the changing consumption preferences.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">This shift in consumption follows the pattern observed in developed countries in the evolution of the global food demand. There is a shift from carbohydrate staples to animal sources and sugar. On following this pattern, in future, there will be increasing demand for prepared meals, snack foods and convenience foods and further on the demand would shift towards functional, organic and diet foods. These are post-liberalization trends that have given an impetus to the sector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some Structural Issues</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Farmers have a limited market for their agricultural produce, which are confined to the local ‘Mandis’, and are governed by APMC under the respective state government; and the</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">farmers can only sell to them. They cannot sell directly to the private parties for further processing. As a result, they are denied better prices and also prevent food processing. They also have limited information about the market(s), prevailing prices and operate within their limited knowledge, based on their own wisdom.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The supply chain of agricultural produce from the farmer to the ultimate consumer lacks transparency and passes through a number of middlemen raising cost through commission charges, resulting in higher prices without any value addition. Further, the absence of storage/warehousing facilities and an inefficient transport system results in wastage, which only add up to higher prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There is virtual no use made of even the available technology let alone leveraging technology in the entire supply chain. There is no quality control and testing mechanism for agricultural produce which reaches the consumer. The extent of use of fertilizers, hygiene aspects and whether they are safe for human consumption is not seen as anyone’s responsibility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Remedial Measures</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The government has taken the first step, by allowing the FDI in multi-brand retailing. Despite the opposition by various vested groups, it is a step in the right direction (which are dealt at length in the section on foreign investment). This will address most of the structural issues, especially back end activities. This will lead to an organized development of the supply chain bring in transparency and the investment in development of cold chains and warehousing facilities. It will also lead to a technology infusion and a boost to the food processing industry. This will also ensure a larger participation of the private sector in the entire chain.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">However, this step will require a critical enabler, that of, amending to the respective APMC act of the respective state governments. This amendment will allow farmers to sell directly to those interested in food processing, which allow private sector to set up back yards for picking up produce from the farmers. It will also open up the supply chain.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is for this reason the central government has permitted the FDI subject to consent of state governments.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In recent times, there has been a biotechnology revolution and now is the time for ‘food revolution’ around food processing industry and this is the reason why this industry is known as a ‘sunrise industry in view of its potentiality. India besides meeting its own food needs in terms of quality, diversified and value added products is also capable of expanding to global markets. The food market can never have a down turn like other markets as it is driven as a basic necessity and the demand will always be there for the same. The real challenge will be from the supply side or the ability to feed this growing market.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The food processing industry in India has only become to evolve and has the capability of becoming the fastest growing sector in the future, with tremendous opportunity and potential, but also at the same time a challenge in overcoming the structural issues,</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">improvements in supply chain and transforming from an informal to a formal sector business activity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AGRICULTURE POLICY: VISION 2020</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Impressive strides attained by India in the agricultural front during the last three decades could be attributed to the several million small farming families that form the backbone of Indian agriculture and economy. Policy support, production strategies, public investment in infrastructure, research and extension for crop, livestock and fisheries have significantly helped to increase food production and its availability.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite the impressive growth and development, India is still home to the largest number of poor people of the world. India has high population pressure on land and other resources to meet its food and development needs. Due to this, natural resource, water and bio-diversity are under severe pressure.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Due to the increase in population and income growth, demand for extra food grains also increases. Besides this, significant increase in demand is happening in the supply of livestock, fish and horticultural products as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">So, future increases in the production of cereals and non-cereal agricultural commodities will have to be essentially achieved through increases in productivity, as the possibilities of expansion of area and livestock population are minimal. To meet the projected demand in the year 2020, country must double per hectare yield of various crops.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Emerging Trends</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The agriculture sector recorded satisfactory growth recently due to improved technology, irrigation, inputs and pricing policies. Livestock, poultry, fisheries and horticulture are surging ahead in production growth in recent years. Industrial and service sectors have expanded faster than agriculture sector resulting in declining share of agriculture in national accounts.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Despite all these structural changes, agriculture still remains a key sector by providing both  employment and  livelihood opportunities to  more than  70  percent  of the country’s population. The contribution of small farmers to the national and household food security has been steadily increasing. The water availability for agricultural uses has reached a critical level and deserves urgent policy attention.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">India is having high population pressure on land and other resources to meet its food and developmental needs. The natural resource base of land, water and bio-diversity is under severe and continuous pressure. Food demand challenges ahead are formidable and there are serious gaps in yield potential and technology transfer. Due to this the national average yields of most of the commodities are low.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Concentration was on enhanced production of a few commodities like rice and wheat, which could quickly contribute to increased total food and agricultural production. This resulted in considerable depletion of natural resources and the rainfed dry areas having</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">maximum concentration of resource poor farmers remained ignored, aggravating problems of inequity and regional imbalances. This also led to a high concentration of malnourished people in these rainfed, low productive areas. This era also witnessed rapid loss of soil nutrients, agro- biodiversity including indigenous land races and breeds.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">So, the agriculture policy must accelerate all-round development and economic</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">viability of agriculture in comprehensive terms. Farmers must be provided the necessary support, encouragement and incentives. It must focus both on income and greater on- farm and off-farm job and livelihood opportunities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Major Issues Concerning Agriculture</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;
