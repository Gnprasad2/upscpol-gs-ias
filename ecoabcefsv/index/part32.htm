Secondly, the markets for the farmers are distorted, not enabling them to get the best prices and there is a need to connect the farmer directly with the markets what is referred</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">as F(Farmer) • F(firm) • F(fork).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">At present, selling of agricultural commodities is under the APMCs of the respective state government. Today, technology/internet provides not only for domestic access but also for global access.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Farmers would need to be sensitized towards accessing those markets which get them a better pricing. This would also do away with the inefficient middle men syndrome, which are intermediaries with no contribution and on the contrary are largely responsible for distorting, hoardings and other such malpractices.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Third, is contract farming which also allows for direct contact of the farmer with the market. Under this, the land is with the farmer except that production of a crop is under a ‘contract’ with a buyer directly who also has the responsibility of providing necessary inputs and also picking up the produce whenever ready.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">This will however require two critical supports from the government:</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• Amendments to the respective APMC of different state governments.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">• Enacting legislations to ensure that interest of the farmers is adequately protected. Fourthly, a serious thought would have to be afforded to corporate farming which allows private sector players to enter into agricultural activities. It is not true that this step would lead to greater marginalization and exploitation of the small and marginal farmers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">There is a larger take away in the form of increased productivity, commercialization, diversification, greater value-addition, greater and efficient use of land, building an efficient supply chain, increased investment and readily absorbed modern technologies. Almost 40 per cent of food products are wasted and destroyed in the absence of supply chain which can easily be plugged by the large corporates resulting in increased supply of food products and this would lead to lower prices in the markets.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Fifthly, what is required today is complete mapping of soils across the length and breadth of the country, superimposed with historical data of the climate, rainfall, crop suitability and then decide on the cropping pattern. Today, technology information is available to allow for soil, climate-based cropping pattern and not on traditional and historical-based cropping pattern.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Sixthly, need of growth will start to encroach upon land for setting up the special economic zones, setting up power plants, building roads, etc., which means in future the land available for agriculture would gradually be reduced.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">In terms of The National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land, Government of India, land under non-agriculture has increased from 3 per cent in 1950—51 to over 11 per cent presently. This makes increasing productivity not only important but an absolute ‘Must’.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Seventhly, there is an increasing trend amongst farmers in the belief of agriculture as non-viable and unprofitable provided, the increasing cost of production and they exiting by selling the land for industrial activities. In recent times, the government is also declaring large land area as non-agriculture to support industrial growth.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Herein, lies the challenges of balancing both but larger challenge would be to reestablish agricultural activities as not only viable but also as a profitable commercial proposition.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Eighth, is the land reforms which have been an avowed objective since Independence but little has been done and still lesser achieved. There is a need for this to be prioritized by the state governments. Further efforts should be made to computerize land records such as the ‘Bhoomi Project in Karnataka’ and web-based land records under the ‘Dharitree Project in Assam’. India also has large waste land area which could be given to rural</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">landless people on ownership basis at free of cost for integrated farming -cum -forestry operations. This would serve the objective of utilization of waste land besides giving the landless farmers a source of livelihood.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Ninthly, current agriculture sector is starved of investment and it receives as little as 0.3 per cent of GDP. There is an urgent need to step up public investment in irrigation, roads, power and public health.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Finally, today strategy for agriculture sector would have to be broken down to the last unit which is the village or at best district level. Issues at each district level would need to be prioritized and then efforts should be made for their resolution.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">What the agriculture sector needs is not another green or rainbow or evergreen revolution but a renaissance which is rebuilding the agriculture sector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part31.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part33.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
