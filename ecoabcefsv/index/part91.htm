It is as a part of the reforms that today there are big private banks such as ICICI, HDFC, Axis and foreign banks such as the Citi group, HSBC, Barclays operating along with the public sector banks.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) Public sector were provided greater autonomy to function in a competitive environment and frame independent policies based on broad framework provided by RBI.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(3) Interest rates both the deposits as well as advances were de-regulated and each bank was free to decide on the interest rates it chose to offer including interest on savings account which until recently was regulated by RBI.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) Similarly, in respect of lending rates, banks were free to decide on the interest rate they would charge, they had to publish the lowest rate of interest they would charge to their best except that clients known as the benchmarked prime lending rate (BPLR).</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• BPLR, however, lacked transparency as banks were lending even below BPLR known as sub BPLR lending. As a result, transmission of policy rate of RBI on lending by banks was diffused. To obviate this, RBI in 2010 has asked the banks to switch to base rate of interest, and that lending would not be done by banks, below their respective published base rate of interest, except DRI advances for weaker sector, loans against own deposits and loans to employees.</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• The basic difference between BPLR and base rate is that, while BPLR had a component of risk premium, it has to be loaded on the base rate. Thus, lending below base rate would be a losing proposition for banks.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• The MCLR methodology for fixing interest rates for advances was introduced by the Reserve Bank of India with effect from April 1, 2016. This new methodology replaces the base rate system introduced in July 2010. In other words, all rupee Ioans sanctioned and credit limits renewed w.e.f. April 1, 2016 would be priced with reference to the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) which will be the internal benchmark (means a reference rate determined internally by the bank) for such purposes.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -15pt;    text-align: justify;">• Existing loans and credit limits linked to the Base Rate (internal benchmark rate used to determine interest rates uptill 31 March 2016) or Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR or the internal benchmark rate used to determine the interest rates on advances/loans sanctioned upto June 30, 2010.) would continue till repayment or renewal, as the case may be. However, existing borrowers will have the option to move to the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) linked loan at mutually acceptable terms.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">• The marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) refers to the minimum interest rate of a bank below which it cannot lend, except in some cases allowed by the RBI. It is an internal benchmark or reference rate for the bank. MCLR actually describes the method by which the minimum interest rate for loans is determined by a bank - on the basis of marginal cost or the additional or incremental cost of arranging one more rupee to the prospective borrower.</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -20pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) Banking was made more transparent, stress on full disclosure of both the good and bad assets.</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) There was a standardization and uniform income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms for the banking sector. For the first time, a uniform definition was given to non-performing assets (NPAs) known as the 90 days norms. Thus, interest on loans provided if not received within the stipulated time would require to be classified as an NPA.</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) Realizing that banking is risky business having normal risks in lending and also to safeguard interest, banks were required to adhere to ‘capital adequacy’ norms in terms of international best practices (dealt separately below).</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Finally, the overall objective was to bring in greater competition in the banking sector allowing for better products, improved services and fine-tuned interest rates to support the financial requirements of a growing economy like India and enable bigger banks in India to emerge as global banks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part90.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part92.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
