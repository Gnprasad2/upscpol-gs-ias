This is said to be as one of the major cause for buildup of inflationary pressures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liquidity</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">A bank accepts deposits from the public which is lent in the economy. The money which can potentially’ be lent by the banks is known to be liquidity. Bank leverages the deposit manifold for lending in the economy known as ‘credit creation’ by banks. This credit creation is almost like fresh money injected in the economy and contributes to inflationary pressures. Thus, liquidity in the economy should strike a balance between requirements of growth and at the same time keep the prices under check. Managing liquidity is a major aspect of the RBI functions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Previously, it was mentioned that RBI was the apex central bank of the country functioning as banker to the government and banks, responsible for printing of currency’ notes, overseeing the functioning of the banking sector and now its another important and critical role in liquidity management.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">It is important to understand first that money deposited in the bank is a source of liquidity. Money deposited could either be ‘demand’ deposits (payable by the bank on demand by a customer like money retaining in your savings account in the bank can be withdrawn by you at any time) or, ‘time’ deposits (can be withdrawn after a fixed period only like fixed deposits). Both demand as well as time deposits is the liabilities of the bank as the bank has to pay it back to the customer.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, both are known as ‘demand and time liabilities’ of banks. These demand and time liabilities of the banking system are the source of increasing liquidity. If unchecked, it will be keep on increasing. RBI cannot question the public to not deposit money in the banks as it is the source of liquidity and neither can it direct banks to stop lending as if they do not lend they will not be able to meet the interest on deposits which the banks have to pay and also not able to earn profits for their future growth.</p><p style="text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">RBI thus has certain quantitative and qualitative tools through which it manages liquidity and they are as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(1) <b>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)—</b>Every bank has to retain a certain percentage of its demands and time liabilities in cash with the RBI which can be raised by the RBI to drain out excess liquidity or reduced to release the liquidity in the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">For example, on a public deposit base of over ₹ 50,00,000 crores in the banking system a 1 per cent increase in CRR would lead in overnight transfer 50,000 crores from the banking system to RBI or which cannot be leveraged for lending by the banks. Even a 0.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">25 per cent increase would imply about ₹ 12,500 crores going out of the banking system. Such a large amount could lead to a drop in lending by banks dampening industrial growth or even triggering a recession in the economy.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Thus, CRR as a monetary tool which has to be carefully used by the RBI keeping in view all aspects of the economy and not merely decreasing liquidity for fears of inflation. Frequent use of the CRR, especially their increase by any central bank of a country sends negative sentiments in the economy. Changes in CRR are necessary in exceptional circumstances or adverse developments in the economy rather than being frequently used as a monetary tool for managing liquidity.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">The other issue in its use is that it is applicable to all banks alike and does not allow banks to take a long-term lending decision as they are uncertain about when the RBI would raise CRR. The present CRR effective from Dec, 2017 is</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">4.00 per cent.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(2) <b>Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)—</b>This is another monetary tool of the RBI, in terms of which every bank is required to set aside again a certain percentage of their demand and time liabilities and retain as cash with RBI, or in gold with the RBI or invested in government securities. The banks prefer to invest in government securities as it earns them interest.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">At present, a minimum 20% (effective from August 2017) » <span class="s19">r </span>the  demand  and time liabilities are to be invested. Banks have, however, parked greater than the minimum stipulation in government securities and is thus today an in-effective tool to managing liquidity.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: left;">(3) <b>Bank Rate—</b>It is the rate of interest charged by RBI for lending money to banks against eligible securities. In the era of controlled and regulated banking, bank rates were raised to discourage banks to borrow from RBI for increasing liquidity as a way to reduce liquidity. It also served as a bench mark for determining other rates of interest by the RBI. Bank rate though still continuing is not used as a tool for liquidity management by RBI as there is already a secondary market for such securities and it has lost its significance. It presently uses as a penalty rate imposed by RBI on banks for violations of RBI directives.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(4) <b>Open market operations (OMO)—</b>This is sale/purchase of secondary government securities by RBI through the auction route and not binding on the banks unlike the CRR and SLR. In periods of excess liquidity RBI resorts to ‘sale’ of government securities to banks draining out the money from banks thus reducing liquidity. For increasing liquidity, it purchases’ securities from banks thereby transferring money to banks to lend resulting in liquidity increase. These OMO are performed at quarterly intervals.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(5) <b>Repo auction (Re-purchase obligations)—</b>This is the most frequently used tool by the RBI for managing short-term liquidity even overnight. It is the same as the OMO except that there is an inbuilt clause of automatic ‘repurchase’ after a specified period. Banks can keep eligible government securities, over and above those kept for maintaining SLR, with RBI and borrow for a short period (generally overnight) and interest paid by banks on such borrowings is called as ‘Repo rate.’</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">RBI also has a window where it offers government securities, which banks can subscribe, and the rate of interest now paid by the RBI to banks is referred as ‘Reverse repo.’ Both of these will involve repurchase after the contracted period automatically. Both these rates are determined by RBI. Repo rate and reverse repo rate are linked on a 25 bps and always repo rate (presently 6.0% effective from September 2017) will be higher than the reverse repo rate (presently 5.75% effective from September 2017).</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(6) Marginal Standing Facility- <span class="p">This is a new Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) created by Reserve Bank of India in 2011. It is a window for banks to borrow from the Reserve Bank of India in an emergency situation when inter-bank liquidity dries up completely. The MSF rate is pegged 100 basis points or a percentage point above the Repo Rate. Under this facility, banks can borrow funds up to one percentage of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -19pt;    text-align: justify;">(7) <b>Moral Suasion. </b>It refers to a method adopted by the Central Bank to persuade or convince the commercial banks to advance credit in the economic interest of the country. In this process, the Central Bank requests or persuade the commercial banks to lend or credit to other banks or institutes in compliance with the general monetary policy of the central.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Ideally short-term/volatile liquidity should be addressed through repo auctions, medium-term liquidity through OMO and long-term liquidity through the CRR.</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 15pt;    text-align: justify;">Reserve Bank of India addresses liquidity management and changes made to the CRR, SLR, repo rates as part of the annual monetary policy reviewed on a quarterly basis and rates revised keeping in view the liquidity position. An area of concern of the RBI in its policy is to keep a watch on inflation. While RBI role, besides liquidity management, controlling  inflation, also acts as bankers to all the commercial banks in the country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part92.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part94.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
