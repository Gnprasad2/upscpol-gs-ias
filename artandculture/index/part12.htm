From the time Ashoka divided up the existing body relics of the Buddha and erected monuments to enshrine them, the <i>stupas </i>became the objects of cult worship. In Buddhist tradition, originally the 9 <i>stupas </i>were built after the death of Buddha - 8 of them over the relics and 9th over the vessel in which the relics were originally deposited.<i>Stupas </i>were constructed over the relics of the Buddha at Rajagraha, Vaishali, Kapilvastu, Allakapa, Ramagrama, Vethadipa, Pava, Kushinagar and Pippalvina.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The core of the <i>stupa </i>was made up of unburnt brick and the outer face of burnt brick, covered with thick layer of plaster. The <i>stupa </i>was crowned by an umbrella of wooden fence enclosing a path for <i>pradaskshina </i>(circumambulatory path)<i>. </i>One of the best examples of the structure of a <i>stupa </i>in the third century BCE is at Bairat in Rajasthan. It is a very grand <i>stupa </i>having a circular mound with a circumambulatory path. The great <i>stupa</i>at Sanchi was built with bricks during the time of Ashoka and later it was covered with stone and many new additions were made.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the subsequent century, <i>stupas </i>were elaborately built with certain additions like the enclosing of the circumambulatory path with railings and sculptural decoration. There were numerous <i>stupas </i>constructed earlier but expansions or new additions were made in the second century BCE. The <i>stupa </i>consists of a cylindrical drum and a circular <i>anda </i>with a <i>harmika </i>and <i>chhatra </i>on the top which remain consistent throughout with minor variations and changes in shape and size. The three <i>chhatra </i>on the <i>stupas </i>represent <i>triratnas</i>of Buddhism i.e. Buddha (The enlightened), <i>Dhamma </i>(doctrine) and <i>Sangh </i>(order). Apart from the circumambulatory path, gateways were added. Thus, with the elaborations in <i>stupa </i>architecture, there was ample space for the architects and sculptors to plan elaborations and to carve out images.</p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"   src="Image_014.png"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Plan of Stupa</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During the early phase of Buddhism, Buddha is depicted symbolically through footprints, <i>stupas</i>, lotus throne, <i>chakra, </i>etc. This indicates either simple worship, or paying respect, or at times depicts historisisation of life events. Gradually narrative became a part of the Buddhist tradition. Thus events from the life of the Buddha, the <i>Jataka </i>stories, were depicted on the railings and <i>torans </i>of the <i>stupas</i>. Mainly synoptic narrative, continuous narrative and episodic narrative are used in the pictorial tradition. While events from the life of the Buddha became an important theme in all the Buddhist monuments, the <i>Jataka </i>stories also became equally important for sculptural decorations. The main events associated with the Buddhaâ€™s life which were frequently depicted were events related to the birth, renunciation, enlightenment, <i>dhammachakrapravartana</i>, and <i>mahaparinibbana </i>(death). Among the <i>Jataka </i>stories that are frequently depicted are Chhadanta <i>Jataka</i>, Vidurpundita <i>Jataka</i>, Ruru <i>Jataka</i>, Sibi <i>Jataka</i>, Vessantara <i>Jataka </i>and Shama <i>Jataka</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part11.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part13.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
