The new five year Foreign Trade Policy, 2015–20 provides a framework for increasing exports of goods and services as well as generation of employment and increasing value addition in the country, in keeping with the Make in India. The focus of the new policy is to support both the manufacturing and services sectors, with a special emphasis on improving the ‘ease of doing business’. The special features of the FTP 2015–20 are as follows:</p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i). <span style=" color: #000F67;">Two new schemes have been intorduced, namely—</span></p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) for export of specified goods to specified markets.</span></p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) for increasing exports of notified services, in place of a plethora of schemes earlier, with different conditions for eligibility and usage.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There would be no conditionality attached to any scrips issued under these schemes. Duty credit scrips issued under MEIS and SEIS and the goods imported against these scrips are fully transferable. For grant of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">rewards under MEIS, the countries have been categorized into 3 Groups, whereas the rates of rewards under MEIS range from 2 per cent to 5 per cent. Under SEIS the selected Services would be rewarded at the rates of 3 per cent and 5 per cent.</p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Measures have been adopted to nudge procurement of capital goods from indigenous manufacturers under the EPCG scheme by reducing specific export obligation to 75 per cent of the normal export obligation. This will promote the domestic capital goods manufacturing industry. Such flexibilities will help exporters to develop their productive capacities for both local and global consumption.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #798C34;">(iii) </span>Measures have been taken to give a boost to exports of defense and hi- tech items. At the same time <span class="s299">e-Commerce </span>exports of handloom products, books/periodicals, leather footwear, toys and customized fashion garments through courier or foreign post office would also be able to get benefit of MEIS (for values upto INR 25,000). These measures would not only capitalize on India’s strength in these areas and increase exports but also provide employment.</p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">In order to give a boost to exports from SEZs, government has now decided to extend benefits of both the reward schemes (MEIS and SEIS) to units located in SEZs. It is hoped that this measure will give a new impetus to development and growth of SEZs in the country.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #798C34;">(v) </span>Trade facilitation and enhancing the <span class="s299">ease of doing business </span>are the other major focus areas—</p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <span style=" color: #000F67;">One of the major objective of new FTP is to move towards paperless working in 24×7 environment.</span></p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The government has reduced the number of mandatory documents required for exports and imports to three, which is comparable with international benchmarks.</span></p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(c) <span style=" color: #000F67;">A facility has been created to upload documents in exporter/importer profile and the exporters will not be required to submit documents repeatedly.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #798C34;">(d) </span>Attention has also been paid to simplify various <span class="s299">Aayat Niryat Forms</span>, bringing in clarity in different provisions, removing ambiguities and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">enhancing electronic governance.</p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(e) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Approved Exporter System (AES) has been launched to enable manufacturers to self-certify their manufactured goods originating from India with a view to qualifying for preferential treatment under various forms of bilateral and regional trade agreements This will help these manufacturer exporters considerably in getting fast access to international markets.</span></p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(vi) <span style=" color: #000F67;">A number of steps have been taken for encouraging manufacturing and exports under 100 per cent schemes. The steps include a fast track clearance facility for these units, permitting them to share infrastructure facilities, permitting inter unit transfer of goods and services, permitting them to set up warehouses near the port of export and to use duty free equipment for training purposes.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #798C34;">(vii) </span>Considering the strategic significance of <span class="s299">small and medium scale enterprise </span>in the manufacturing sector and in employment generation, <span class="s299">MSME Clusters-108 </span>have been identified for focused interventions to boost exports. Outreach activities will be organized in a structured way at these clusters with the help of EPCs and other willing <span class="s299">Industry Partners </span>and <span class="s299">Knowledge Partners</span>.</p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(viii) <i>Niryat Bandhu Scheme </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">has been galvanized and repositioned to achieve the objectives of Skill India.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The FTP Statement describes the market and product strategy and measures required for trade promotion, infrastructure development and overall enhancement of the trade ecosystem. It seeks to enable India to respond to the challenges of the external environment, keeping in step with a rapidly evolving international trading architecture and make trade a major contributor to the country’s economic growth and development. The Government of India promised to have regular interactions with all stakeholders, including state governments to achieve the national objectives.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s298">Need of Shift: </span>The environment for global trade policy has probably undergone a <span class="s299">paradigm shift </span>in the aftermath of Brexit and the US elections. The Brexit was motivated by protectionist sentiments in the UK. Similar sentiments are being signalled by the new US government, too. This may</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">lead to sharp appreciation in the US dollar—it has already appreciated 5.3 per cent during November-December 2016, settling at 3.1 per cent higher by January 2017 (against an index of partner currencies). During the most protectionist phase of the USA (mid to late 1980s) a sharp rise was seen in the dollar—caused by tighter monetary policy and relaxing fiscal policy.</p><p class="s298" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part423.htm#bookmark2001" class="s58" name="bookmark1974">A vacuum is being created in international trade leadership under the possible resurgence of protectionist pressures. In such a scenario needs to promote open markets and tap domestic growth. Similar moves are needed from the emerging market economies (EMEs), too. In this way, for India two specific opportunities</a><span style=" color: #798C34; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">21</span> <span class="p">arise:</span></p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">India could get much benefits by promoting labour-intensive exports and negotiating free trade agreements with the UK and Europe. The potential gains for export and employment are substantial—additional export of US$ 3 billion (specially in the apparel and leather &amp; footwear sectors) and additional employment of 1.5 lakhs.</span></p><p class="s302" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The likely retreat of USA from regional initiatives such as the Trans- Pacific Partnership (TPP) in Asia and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the EU, it is possible that the relevance of the WTO might increase. As a major stakeholder and given the geo-political shifts under way, India should proactively pursue to revive WTO and multilateralism.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part419.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part421.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
