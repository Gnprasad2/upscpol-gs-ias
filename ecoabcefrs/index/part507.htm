Coupled with its vulnerability in terms of the impact of climate change, this entails that India faces formidable and complex challenges in terms of balancing the sustainable development agenda. Given the challenges it faces, it has prepared an ambitious plan in terms of clean energy, energy efficiency and lower emission intensity while addressing the critical issue of poverty and food security</a><span style=" color: #05B66E; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">9</span><span class="p">—</span></p><p class="s359" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">India’s INDC sets ambitious renewable energy targets mainly in terms of solar and wind energy. With a potential of more than 100 GW, the target is to achieve 60 GW of wind power and 100 GW of solar power installed capacity by 2022. Given that in 2014 the world’s entire installed solar power capacity was 181 GW, this target is extremely ambitious and clearly places India as a major potential renewable energy player </span><i>(World</i></p><p class="s354" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Resource Institute, October 2015).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #05B66E;">(ii) </span>India has also launched a historic <span class="s354">International Solar Alliance (ISA) </span>which  is envisaged  as a coalition  of solar resource-rich  countries to address their special energy needs and will provide a platform to collaborate on addressing the identified gaps through a common, agreed approach.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #05B66E;">(iii) </span>Although there is lot of emphasis on boosting the renewable energy sector, the INDC clearly state that coal would continue to be the dominant source of power generation in the future. However, the INDC incorporates a lot of initiatives to improve the efficiency of coal-based power plants and to reduce their carbon footprint. <span class="s354">Clean coal technologies </span>would be critical to meeting the demand for power generation in the future.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #05B66E;">(iv) </span>In addition to mitigation-related activities, the INDC also incorporates adaptation-related activities. Out of the eight National Missions on Climate Change in India, five focus on <span class="s354">adaptation </span>in sectors like agriculture, water and forestry.</p><p class="s359" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Since June 2014, when international oil prices started declining, India has increased its excise duties from</span></p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rs. 15.5 per litre to Rs. 22.7 per litre as of <span class="s354">December 2016 </span>for branded petrol and from Rs. 5.8 per litre to Rs. 19.7 per litre for branded diesel. The results of the climate change effort undertaken by the major G-20 countries and India are striking—the increase in petrol tax has been over 150 per cent in India. In contrast, the governments of most advanced countries have simply passed on the benefits to consumers, setting back the cause of curbing climate change. As a result, India now outperforms all the countries except those in Europe in terms of tax on petroleum and diesel.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #05B66E;">(vi) </span>Having decisively moved from a regime of carbon subsidies, it is now de facto imposing a <span class="s354">carbon tax </span>on petroleum products at about US$ 150 per ton, which is about 6 times greater than the level recommended by the ‘Stern Review on Climate Change’.</p><p class="s359" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(vii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">India is faring relatively better to other countries at comparable stages of economic development in terms of the ‘share of fossil fuel use in</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">overall energy consumption’. India’s reliance on fossil fuels remains well below China (the most relevant comparator) but also below the US, UK and Europe at comparable stages of development—this echoes India’s commitment to never exceed the per capita emission of advanced countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Mobilising <span class="s354">finance </span>is critical to achieving  the ambitious targets set by India. Preliminary estimates suggest that at least US$ 2.5 trillion (at 2014-15 prices) will be required for meeting India’s climate change action under the INDC between now and 2030. While the maximum share of the country’s current climate finance comes from <span class="s354">budgetary </span>sources, India is not relying solely on them and is experimenting with a careful mix of market mechanisms together with fiscal instruments and regulatory interventions. However, it needs to be emphasized that international finance is a critical enabler for the scaled up climate action plans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part506.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part508.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
