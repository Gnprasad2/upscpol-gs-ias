Revenue expenditures are of immediate nature (this has to be done) and since they are consumptive/non-productive they are considered as a kind of expenditure which sums up to a heinous crime in the area of fiscal policy. Governments fulfil the gap/deficit with the money which could have been spent/intvested in productive areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">A government might have its revenue expenditures less than its revenue receipts, i.e., having (<span class="s333">revenue surplus</span>) budget. Such fiscal policy is considered good where the government has been able to manage some money out of its revenue budget which could be spent for the creation of productive assets. Yes, another thing that should be kept in mind, as how the government has managed this surplus and whether the policies which made this happen are judicious enough or not. In the Second Plan, India emerged as a revenue- suplus state, but experts did not appreciate it as it had many bad impacts on the economy—higher tax rates culminated in tax evasion, corruption, creation of black money, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Revenue deficit may be shown in the quantitative form (as how much the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">gross/total deficit is in currency terms) or in percentage terms of the GDP for that particular year (shown as percentage of GDP).

Conventionally, ‘revenue deficit’ (RD) is the difference between revenue receipts and revenue expenditures. Here, revenue expenditures includes all the grants which the Union Government gives to the state governments and the UTs—some of which <span class="s334">create assets </span>(though these assets are not owned by the Government of India but the concerned state governments and the UTs). According to the Finance Ministry <span class="s333">(Union Budget 2011–12)</span>, such revenue expenditures contribute to the growth in the economy and therefore, <span class="s333">should not be treated as unproductive </span>in nature like other items in the revenue expenditures. And on this logic, a new methodology was introduced to capture the ‘effective revenue deficit’, which is the Revenue Deficit ‘excluding’ those revenue expenditures of the Government of India which were done in the form of <span class="s336">GoCA </span>(grants for creation of capital assets).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The GoCA includes the Government of India grants forwarded to the states &amp; UTs for the implementation of the centrally sponsored programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, etc., these expenses though they are shown by the Government of India in its Revenue Expenditures they are involved with <span class="s333">asset creation </span>and cannot be considered completely ‘unproductive’ like other items put in the basket of the Revenue Expenditures—the reason why a new ‘terminology’ was created.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The term was innovated by the Government of the time to show some rationale in its high revenue deficit by bringing the logic that all of it were not like a typical revenue expenditure (which are consumptive in nature) and some of it were used to create ‘capital assets’ also (though they cannot be shown in the ‘capital’ heads of expenditures). Though, the new Government at centre does not give the same significance to the term, it has been releasing data related to it.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The <span class="s334">Union Budget 2017-18 </span>has committed to reduce the <span class="s333">effective revenue deficit </span>to 0.7 per cent in 2017-18 and 0.2 per cent in 2018-19 (it was estimated to be 1.2 per cent for 2016-17).
