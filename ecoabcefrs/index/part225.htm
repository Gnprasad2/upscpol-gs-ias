The experts and industrialists (new comers) complained that the industrial licencing policy was serving just the opposite purpose for which it was</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mooted. Inspired by the socialistic ideals and nationalistic feelings the licencing policy had the following reasons:</p><p class="s174" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">exploitation of resources for the development of all;</span></p><p class="s174" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">priority of resource exploitation for the industries;</span></p><p class="s174" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">price-control of the goods produced by the licenced industries;</span></p><p class="s174" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">checking concentration of economic power;</span></p><p class="s174" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">channelising investment into desired direction (according to the planning process).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part262.htm#bookmark1376" class="s58" name="bookmark1272">In practice, the licencing policy was not serving the above-given purpose properly. A powerful industrial house was always able to procure fresh licences at the cost of a new budding entrepreneur. The price regulation policy via licencing was aimed at helping the public by providing cheaper goods, but it indirectly served the private licenced industries ultimately (as central subsidies were given to the private companies from where it was to benefit the poor in the form of cheaper goods). Similarly, the older and well- established industrial houses were capable of creating hurdles for the newer ones with the help of different kinds of trade practices forcing the latter to agree for sell-outs and takeovers. A number of committees were set up by the government to look into the matter and suggest remedies.</a><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">11 </span><a href="part262.htm#bookmark1377" class="s58">The committees on industrial licencing policy review not only pointed out several shortcomings of the policy, but also accepted the useful role of industrial licencing.</a><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">12 </span>Finally, it was in 1969 that the new industrial licencing policy was announced which affected the following major changes in the area:<a name="bookmark1273">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s174" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act was passed.
