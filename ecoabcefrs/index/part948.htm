Area sown (upto 14th October, 2016) under all kharif crops taken together was 1075.7 lakh hectares (3.5 per cent higher compared to the corresponding period of 2015–16)—with <span class="s403">arhar </span>showing the highest increase of 40.24 per cent. The rabi crops’ sowing was in progress—the area coverage under rabi crops (by 13th January 2017) was 2016–17 at 616.21 lakh hectares (5.9 per cent higher than the corresponding week of last year).

On account of the volatility of prices of pulses, a Committee on </span><i>Incentivising Pulses Production</i></p><p class="s403" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Related Policies <span class="p">was set up (headed by Arvind Subramanian, Chief Economic Adviser). To increase productivity of pulses, a new extra early maturing, high yielding variety of Arhar </span>(Pusa Arhar-16) <span class="p">has been developed to be made available for farmers in the next Kharif season. During 2016–17, MSPs were raised substantially mainly for pulses to incentivize farmers.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s405">Foodgrain stocks &amp; procurement: </span>The food-grain management involves procurement of rice and wheat following the norms for buffer stocks.

Procurement of rice as on 6th January 2017 was 23.2 million tonnes during kharif marketing season 2016–17 whereas procurement of wheat was 22.9 million tonnes during rabi marketing season 2016–17.
