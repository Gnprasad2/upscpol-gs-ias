Four of the general insurance companies, viz., Star Health and Alliance Insurance Company, Apollo Munich Health Insurance Company, Max BUPA Health Insurance Company, and Religare Health Insurance Company function as standalone health insurance companies. Of the 23 insurance companies that have set up operations in the life segment post opening up of the sector, 21 are in joint ventures with foreign partners. Of the 21private insurers who have commenced operations in the non-life segment, 18 are in collaboration with foreign partners.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">After the state monopoly in the insurance sector was dismantled and private players’ entry allowed, the IRDA has played a crucial role in the development and expansion of the sector, there is no doubt in it. But still the sector faces many challenges which, if only tackled well may one say that insurance is serving the interests of the insuring companies and the covered alike. As per the concerned experts, the major challenges Indian insurance is facing today may be seen as given below:</p><p class="s231" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">As per various estimates, only 20 per cent of the insurable Indian population is life-insured; the share of India in global life insurance is</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;"><a href="part335.htm#bookmark1782" class="s58" name="bookmark1757">just 0.66 per cent; and life insurance penetration is at present 2.53 per cent (2004) in the country.</a><a href="part335.htm#bookmark1782" class="s232">10</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The message of life insurance needs to be publicised among the population, specially in the rural areas.

Their reasons are logical as in comparison with the government-owned insurance companies, private companies are always ready with highly attractive and lucrative insurance schemes, but they have not been able to attract the clients for them. Therefore, the private insurance companies have been fetching huge operational losses due to lack of the desired level of their expansion and the overhead expenditure.</a><a href="part335.htm#bookmark1791" class="s232">19</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part331.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part333.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
