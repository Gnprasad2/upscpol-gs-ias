In terms of market features and depth, the Indian equity market ranks among the best in the world. In parallel, the government securities market has also evolved over the years and expanded, given the increasing borrowing requirements of the government. In contrast, the corporate bond market has languished both in terms of market participation and structure. NBCs are the main issuers and very small amounts of finance are raised by companies directly. The <span class="s244">Economic Survey 2010–11</span>, cites many reasons for the less- developed bond market in India—</p><p class="s238" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Predominance of banks loans;</span></p><p class="s238" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">FII’s participation is limited;</span></p><p class="s238" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Pensions and insurance companies and household are limited participants because of lack of investor confidence; and</span></p><p class="s238" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Crowding out by government bonds.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1871">The </a><span class="s237">Economic Survey 2011–12 </span><a href="part382.htm#bookmark1904" class="s58">concluded</a><span style=" color: #ED9A9C; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">15</span><span class="s240"> </span>that there is now ample empirical research to corroborate Schumpeter’s conjecture that financial development facilitates real economic growth. The depth of the financial markets and availability of diverse products should, therefore, not be treated as mere adornment, but as critical ingredients of inclusive growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Banks in India accounted for 14.4 per cent of the financing of large firms in 2000–01, which rose further to 17.8 per cent in 2010–11. The <span class="s237">bond market</span>, on the other hand, has been miniscule in comparison. The thinness of the bond market has been somewhat compensated by foreign borrowing done by Indians, which rose sharply over the last decade. Further, India is characterised by a disproportionate amount of secured borrowing. The small size of unsecured borrowing may, at first sight, not seem to be a matter of concern, but it could be a reflection of the weakness of contract enforcement and lack of adequate information. If contracts were quickly enforced and lenders had information on borrowers, they would be more willing to give unsecured loans. This would give a nimbleness to the financial markets</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">which they presently lack.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There are <span class="s244">many reasons </span>why bond markets are important for an emerging economy. Prominent among these is the fact that they lead to more efficient entrepreneurship and greater value creation. When an entrepreneur takes a loan or issues bonds, all additional profit over and above the pre-fixed repayment amount accrues to the entrepreneur. So he or she is better incentivised to take sharper decisions. By having a weak bond market, we may be foregoing this efficiency. And further, this efficiency gap may well mean that there is less lending and hence less investment and entrepreneurship in the economy than is feasible. Further, as India tries to garner 500 billion dollars from the private sector in the Twelfth Plan for investment in the infrastructure sector, having an active bond market would be a valuable avenue for raising money.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There can be many reasons why, despite these advantages, the bond market has not developed adequately. One reason has to do with what economists call ‘multiple equilibria’. Consider a situation where the bond market is small. If someone buys bonds and later wish to sell these off, he anticipates difficulty. Since the bond market is not active, he may not easily be able to sell the bonds and thus he will hold simply because he cannot find a buyer. Hence, this may lead to discourage someone from buying the bonds in the first place. If everybody reasons like this, the bond market remains thin. Hence, the need is for a push that nudges the market to another equilibrium, where people readily buy bonds because they know that they can easily sell these off and this becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy and sustains the large bond market.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There is effort currently on to try to boost India’s debt and bond markets, and success in this can give another fillip to growth. With the intervention of the <span class="s244">Patil Committee (2005) </span>recommendations, the corporate bond market is slowly evolving. With bank finance drying up for long term infrastructure projects, in view of asset liability problems faced by the banking system, the need for further development of a deep and vibrant corporate bond market can hardly be overemphasised. Recent initiatives for further development of corporate bond markets, taken in the year <span class="s244">2012–13 </span>are as given below :</p><p class="s238" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Banks allowed to take limited membership in SEBI-approved stock</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">exchanges for the purpose of undertaking proprietary transactions in the corporate bond markets.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #ED9A9C;">(ii) </span>To  enhance liquidity  in  the corporate bond  markets,  the IRDA has permitted insurance companies to participate in the repo market. The IRDA has also permitted insurance companies to become users of <span class="s237">‘credit default swap</span>’ (CDS).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1872"><span style=" color: #ED9A9C;">(iii) </span></a>The minimum <a href="part382.htm#bookmark1905" class="s246">haircut</a><span style=" color: #ED9A9C; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">16 </span>(i.e., the difference between prices at which a market maker can buy and sell a security) requirement in corporate debt repo have been reduced from the existing 10 per cent; 12 per cent; 15 per cent to 7.5 per cent; 8.5 per cent; 10 per cent for AAA/AA+/AA-rated corporate bonds.</p><p class="s238" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">MFs have been permitted to participate in CDS in corporate debt securities, as users.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #ED9A9C;">(v) </span>Revised guidelines on CDS for corporate bonds by the RBI provide that in addition to listed corporate bonds, CDS shall also be permitted on <span class="s237">unlisted </span>but rated corporate bonds even for issues other than infrastructure companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1873"><span style=" color: #ED9A9C;">(vi) </span></a>Users shall be allowed to <a href="part382.htm#bookmark1906" class="s246">unwind</a><span style=" color: #ED9A9C; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">17 </span>their CDS-bought position with the original protection seller at a mutually agreeable or FIMMDA (Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India) price.

It accepted many of the recommendations of the <span class="s237">Khan Committee </span>(August 2016) to boost investor participation and market liquidity in the corporate bond market. The new measures as announced by the RBI include:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #ED9A9C;">(i) </span>Commercial banks are permitted to issue rupee-denominated bonds overseas <span class="s237">(masala bonds) </span>for their capital requirements and for financing infrastructure and affordable housing.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #ED9A9C;">(ii) </span>Brokers registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and authorized as market makers in corporate bond market permitted to undertake repo/reverse repo contracts in corporate debt securities.
