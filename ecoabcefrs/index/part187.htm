This involves procurement of foodgrain at MSP by the Government, building up and maintenance of food stocks, their storage, and timely distribution, making foodgrains accessible at reasonable prices to the vulnerable sections of the population.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">However, the system of PDS has many weaknesses leading to leakages and targeted beneficiaries being left out of the system. The PDS incurs high costs for procurement, storage and distribution of foodgrains. There is scope to increase efficiency of the PDS operations and reduce costs. Only a small proportion of the public expenditure/subsidy on PDS reaches the beneficiary. There is a case for introducing DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) for consumers of food and kerosene as is under way in <span class="s155">Andhra Pradesh </span>. Though, there are challenges in implementing DBT.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">As per the Economic Survey 2016-17, despite increased procurement of foodgains offtakes from PDS have been declining in past few years. This suggests that despite enhanced availability in the PDS and high inflation in foodgrains, dependence on the PDS is reducing – this could be only due to two reasons –</p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Foodgrains are not made available timely by the PDS, and/or</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Quality of the PDS foodgrains are inferior in comparison to their counterparts in the open market.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There are certain anomalies in India’s food management under the PDS which need immediate attention –</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #C16E59;">(i) </span>The percentage distribution of the economic cost of wheat and rice has been rising fast. The pooled cost of foodgrains <span class="s155">(MSP plus the Bonus which are offered by the individual states) </span>accounts for <span class="s155">two-thirds </span>of the economic cost of wheat and rice. This has made the economic cost of foodgrains to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) increase over the years.</p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Increasing costs of labour, fertilizers, pesticides and other inputs have made production of crops costlier over the time. This forced the government to keep on increasing the MSPs of the crops, too.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #C16E59;">(iii) </span>The increase in the food subsidy bill is determined by the rate at which the MSPs for wheat and rice increase and the <span class="s155">economic cost </span>of handling grains (their procurement, stocking and distribution to the targeted households). This has been the major factor for ballooning food subsidy bill. Food subsidy bill has increased to over 15 per cent of agri-GDP by 2016-17 from 5 per cent of 2005-06 (as per the <span class="s155">Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices-CACP </span>).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #C16E59;">(iv) </span>The procurement incidentals of wheat and rice consist of costs related to mandi charges and taxes, cost of gunny bags, <span class="s155">arhatiya </span>commission, <span class="s155">mandi </span>labour, forwarding charges, internal movement, storage charges, interest, administrative charges and others. Out of these costs, <span class="s155">mandi </span>charges and taxes constitute more than 40 per cent of the total costs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Opportunity cost of running the PDS have been very high. This is particularly due to increased levels of fund diversion for food subsidy, the government could not support adequate amount of investment in the agricultural sector. This prevented capacity building in the sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Over the time, several discrepancies seeped into the PDS, such as,</p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">high operation costs,</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">high levels of leakages,</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">high administrative costs,</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">corruption, and</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">mismanagement.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Subsidies created some other problems, too.<span class="s155">Firstly, </span>subsidies brought distortions in the market, which hamper the domestic as well as the external interests and <span class="s155">secondly, </span>caused a heavy drain on the government exchequer. PDS poses even higher challenge when domestic or international prices are on the rise and the government is forced to raise the MSPs of crops.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part186.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part188.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
