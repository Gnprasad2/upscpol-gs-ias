The funding situation did not seem conducive enough this is why the government did not think to launch it— falling growth rate in wake of the western recession and many domestic factors. However, providing accessible, affordable and equitable quality health care, especially to the marginalised and vulnerable sections of the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">population is one of the key objectives of the Government. There are innumerable challenges to the delivery of efficient health services in India, given the paucity of resources and the plethora of requirements in the health sector. Population health is also significantly influenced by social and environmental determinants such as age at marriage, nutrition, pollution, access to potable water and hygienic sanitation facilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The Indian health sector has a <span class="s368">mix </span>of both public and private providers of health services. The private sector and the quality of care provided is variable, ranging from informal providers (quacks) to individually run nursing homes to large polyclinics and multiplex hospitals. The regulation for cost and quality of care is largely absent in most f the states. In the case of public sector, the health services are delivered through a network of health facilities including ASHA (a volunteer health worker) at the community level, Health Sub-Center (HSC), Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), District Hospitals, Government Medical College Hospitals and the state and central government assisted Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) hospitals and dispensaries. Outreach and community level services are provided through coordination between ASHA, Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) at the HSC.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;    text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2452">The </a><span class="s368">Key Indicators of social consumption in India: Health-2015</span><a href="part527.htm#bookmark2473" class="s58">, NSSO, 71st Round (January –June 2014) throws some interesting findings</a><span style=" color: #F67C7C; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">14</span>—</p><p class="s371" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <span style=" color: #000F67;">The private sector continues to play a significant role in the provision of outpatient and hospitalised care.

This is largely a result of sustained strengthening of health systems targeted towards maternal and child healthcare through programmes such as Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) and Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK). This is also reflected in 50 per cent sharper decline in MMR in the country as compared to global average rate of decline from the baseline of MDG of 1990.</p><p class="s371" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <span style=" color: #000F67;">The share of public providers in treatment of non-hospitalised patients is very low at 11.5 per cent at HSC, PHC including ASHAs and ANMs. This per centage is even lower for urban areas where the public provisioning of primary health care has been largely absent. This reflects confinement of primary care to selective primary care limited to Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) services. The National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) launched over a year back is trying to address the issue of inadequacy of public provisioning of primary health care in urban areas.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #F67C7C;">• </span>India faces a challenge in the provision of affordable and accessible health care to the population. <span class="s368">Average medical expenditure </span>for treatment (excluding child birth) per hospitalised case if treated in private hospital was about four times than that of public hospital.

All the 12 states (from which the data are available) have more than 50 per cent children fully immunised. The per centage of children who are fully immunised is lower in urban areas compared to rural areas in majority of the States, indicating that although the private sector is more wide spread in urban areas, the availability of preventive health care is through the public health system, which needs strengthening in urban areas.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #F67C7C;">• </span>High-risk patients like children and pregnant women do require special preventive healthcare services.

However, the availability of such personnel to meet various needs of the health sector is a huge challenge in India. The shortage of specialists, doctors, staff nurses, anaesthetists, and others, adversely affects the outreach of health services, especially in rural areas. As per an evaluation study of the NRHM (2011), there is a 95 per cent shortage of skilled health personnel in Jharkhand, around 80 per cent in Madhya Pradesh and 70 per cent in Uttar Pradesh. Assam reported only 11 per cent shortage, while Tamil Nadu did not report any shortage at all.</p><p class="s371" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <i>Rural Health Statistics 2015 </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">reports that at the all-India level, CHCs are short of surgeons by 83 per cent of the total requirement.
