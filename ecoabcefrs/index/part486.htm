More than half of it had been due to huge revenue deficits. The governments were cautioned by the RBI, the Planning Commission as well as by the IMF and the WB about the unsustainability of the fiscal deficits. It was at the behest of the IMF that India started the politically and socially painful process of fiscal reforms, a step towards fiscal consolidation.</a><span style=" color: #808908; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">50</span> <span class="p">A number of steps were taken by the government at the Centre in this direction and there had been incessant attempts to do the same in the states’ public finances too.

the government not to borrow from the RBI except by the WMA; government to bring in greater transparency in fiscal operations; along with the Budget the government to lay statements regarding fiscal policy strategy in the House and Quarterly</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Review of trends of receipts and expenditures of the government.</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">A mechanism (to include state governments under the umbrella of fiscal responsibility) was advised (now implemented, too) by the 12th Finance Commission which allows the state governments to go for market borrowing (without central permission) for their need of plan development provided they pass their fiscal responsibility acts (FRAs) and commit to the fiscal responsibility regarding cutting their revenue and fiscal deficits. By March 2016, all states and UTs had implemented their FRAs.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">India’s fiscal consolidation process by now has had a mixed performance. By now, the FRBM Act has been amended twice (in 2004 and 2012), mainly to redefine the fiscal targets or shift the targets to future years. By early 2010, a new school of thinking emerged in the country as per which fixing hard and fast fiscal targets for the governments, at times, may be counterproductive to the economy. This why the GoI through the <span class="s336">Union Budget 2016-17 </span>proposed to go for a <span class="s333">fixed range </span>for fiscal targets in place of a <span class="s333">fixed number</span>. The Government of India has accordingly announced to set up an expert committee to <span class="s333">review </span>the implementation of the FRBM Act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part485.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part487.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
