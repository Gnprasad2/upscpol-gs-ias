In the early 1970s, the Government of India came with a new idea of it. The major banks of the country were now fully nationalised (14 in number by that time), which had to mobilise resources for the purpose of planned development of India. The private companies who had borrowed capital from these banks (when the banks were privately owned) now wanted their loans to be paid back. The government came with a novel provision for the companies who were unable to repay their loans (most of them were like it)—they could opt to convert their loan amounts into equity shares and hand them over to the banks. The private companies which opted this route (this was a compulsory option) ultimately became a government-owned company as the banks were owned by the Government of India—this was an <span class="s176">indirect </span><a href="part262.htm#bookmark1400" class="s58">route to nationalise private firms. Such a compulsion which hampered the growth and development of the Indian industries was withdrawn by the government in 1991.</a><a href="part262.htm#bookmark1400" class="s175">35</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1302">The picture presented by the New Industrial Policy of 1991 was taken by many experts, the opposition in the Parliament and even the public figures as well as the business and industry of the country as a </a><span class="s176">‘rolling back’ </span><a href="part262.htm#bookmark1401" class="s58">of the state. The glorious role given to the state by the Nehruvian economy seemed completely toppled down. Any one idea the new policy challenged was an emphatic good bye to the ‘control regime’ perpetuated till now by the government. There was a coalition of interests of politicians, bureaucrats, multinationals as well as the domestic industrial and business houses whose interests were sheltered and by the control regime.</a><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">36</span><span class="s178"> </span>Thus, a memorandum to the government requesting not to dismantle the control regime by the major industrial houses of India as well as arrival of the ‘<span class="s173">Swadeshi Jagaran Manch</span>’ were not illogical. But the governments continued with the reform programme with politically permissible pace and a time came when the same industrial houses requested the government (2002) to expedite the process of reform.
