In economics, there has been a bit of resistance in emphasising other aspects of development, because it is thought of giving ground to the neighbouring disciplines.</a><span style=" color: #89D4E2; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">22</span><span class="s27"> </span>The recent <span class="s22">World Development Report (WDR) </span>of 2015 focuses on the behavioural and social foundations of development, and has been very well received.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Government documents (generally, hard-nosed), usually, make no mention</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the role of social norms and culture in promoting</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark263">development and economic efficiency. However, there is now a growing body of literature that demonstrates how certain social norms and cultural practices are vital ingredients for economic efficiency and growth. Groups and societies that are known to be honest and trustworthy tend to do better than societies that do not have this reputation. There have been broad cross- country studies and also laboratory experiments that illustrate this. More generally, what is being argued is that a nation’s success depends of course on its resources, human capital and economic policies, for instance fiscal and monetary policies, but also on the cultural and social norms that permeate the society. Societies that are endowed with personal integrity and trustworthiness have the natural advantage, in that no third party is required to enforce contracts. For outsiders the mere knowledge that a particular society is trustworthy is reason to do more business and trade with it. One reason why these ‘social’ causes of development do not get enough recognition in the literature on economic policy is that the science of </a><span class="s22">how </span>these economics-friendly social qualities are acquired is not yet fully understood. Fortunately, the new discipline of <span class="s27">behavioural economics  </span><a href="part33.htm#bookmark289" class="s58">is beginning to give us some insights into the formation of customs and behaviour:</a><a href="part33.htm#bookmark289" class="s21">23</a></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <span style=" color: #000F67;">It is, for instance, known that buildings and office spaces which are cleaner and aesthetically better maintained result in individuals being more honest and desisting corrupt activity. It is almost as if we have a mental inclination not to defile a good ambience through acts of corruption.</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <span style=" color: #000F67;">New York city’s notorious high crime was controlled, among other things, by cleaning up the city and removing graffiti from the walls. New York’s police department took a decision to deter vandalism and graffiti that scar public spaces. This act of making the cityscape more aesthetic somehow made potential criminals less prone to crime.</span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <span style=" color: #000F67;">One sees casual evidence of this in the behaviour of Delhites using the metro. It has been widely noted that people behave better when they travel on Delhi’s well-maintained metro (postponing their bad behaviour to when they come up to the surface again, some would add).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">All this is in keeping with the influential <span class="s22">broken windows </span>theory in sociology, which maintains that, if we control low level, anti-social behaviour and take small steps to improve the environment, this will have a natural deterrent effect on larger criminal behaviour and acts of corruption. Also, the sheer recognition and awareness that some collective qualities of citizens, such as honesty and trustworthiness, enable the entire society to do well, prompts individuals to adopt those qualities and overcome the ubiquitous free-rider problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part33.htm#bookmark290" class="s58" name="bookmark264">There is a growing literature</a><span style=" color: #89D4E2; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">24</span><span class="s27"> </span>in economics arguing that <span class="s27">pro-social behaviour</span>, which includes <span class="s22">altruism </span>and <span class="s22">trustworthiness</span>, is innate to human beings and, moreover, forms an essential ingredient for the efficient functioning of economies. In other words, human beings have a natural ability to forego personal gains for the sake of other people or because that is what is required because of a promise the person had made. This trait may well have evolutionary roots, but its existence is now well demonstrated in laboratory tests by recent studies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark36" class="s25" name="bookmark265">Values and Economics </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark36" class="s26">                                     </a></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part33.htm#bookmark291" class="s58" name="bookmark266">There is research</a><span style=" color: #89D4E2; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">25</span> <span class="p">in psychology and evolutionary biology which shows that </span>morality<span class="p">, </span>altruism<span class="p">, and other-regarding </span>values <span class="p">are an innate part of the human mind, even though the social setting in which a person lives can nurture or stunt these traits. However, the recognition that these human and moral qualities can have a large impact on economic development came relatively late to economics. Hence, the literature on this is relatively recent and brief. In fact, recent research shows that having a few ‘good’ human beings in society can give rise to dynamics through which we end up with an overall better society. There is also evidence that social norms and habits that at first sight seem ingrained in a society can change over short periods of time. By this argument it is possible for a country to nurture and develop the kinds of social norms that enable a more vibrant economy.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In talking about a nation’s economic progress, all attention, including both praise and criticism, is usually focused on the government. It is, however, important to recognise that much also depends on civil society, the firms, the farmers and ordinary citizens. The social norms and collective beliefs that</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">shape the behaviour of these agents play an important role in how a nation performs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Honesty, punctuality, the propensity to keep promises, the attitude towards corruption are matters shaped in great part by norms, and social beliefs and the behaviour patterns can become habitual. Moreover, in a democracy like India, what can be done by government depends in great measure on how ordinary people think and what people believe in. That is what electoral politics is all about. An important reason why this got so little attention in the past is because so much of traditional economics was written as if these non- economic facets of life did not matter. But we now know that a market economy cannot function if people are totally self serving. While self-interest is a major driver of economic growth, it is important to recognise that honesty, integrity and trustworthiness constitute the cement that binds society. At times economists treated these social norms, preferences and customs as unalterable. If that were so, there would not be much point in analysing their effect. But we do know that these qualities in a people can change. Honesty and integrity can be nurtured and aversion to corruption can be shored up.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">If these traits are absent or inadequate in a nation, it is likely that that nation will stagnate and remain in a chaotic poverty trap. Take for instance, <span class="s27">contracts </span>which enable markets to develop and form the basis of economic life. If the contractual system in a nation is so weak that when a bank gives a 20-year mortgage to a person for buying a house, there is high risk of default, the implication of this is not that banks in that country will make large losses. The implication is that banks will not give loans; and the housing market will remain severely underdeveloped and the total number of houses will be few and far between.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Enforcing complicated or large contracts, especially ones protracted over a long period of time, is the responsibility of the state. The state provides the laws and enforcement to enable people to sign contracts. However, economic life is full of everyday ‘contracts’ (for example, you let me ride in your taxi, and I will pay you at the end of it; I pay you money now and you paint my house over the next two days; or you paint my house over the next two days and I will pay you after that). In these everyday situations it is too cumbersome to bring in the state or the law courts. Here the main guarantor</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">has to be the people’s personal <span class="s27">integrity </span>and <span class="s27">trustworthiness</span>. Societies that have successfully nurtured these qualities have done well; societies that have done poorly on these fronts, tend to do poorly in terms of economic progress.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">It is not known precisely how these values can be inculcated in society. But, hopefully, writing about their importance will catalyse change, as ordinary people realise that for <span class="s22">economic </span>advancement these <span class="s22">social </span>qualities are as important as policies that concern directly with the economy—like operating the stock market or setting the rules of market competition.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Further, basic literacy and better education are helpful since people can then, on their own, reason and reach these conclusions. Literacy has the added value that it implies ordinary people will demand policies which are truly better, rather than those that merely look good on the surface. In a democratic setting like India, this will incentivise politicians to adopt better policies. Finally, if political leaders and policymakers act as <span class="s22">role models </span>in terms of these qualities of honesty, integrity and trustworthiness, that can set the ball rolling. Inclusion of the behavioural dimension of human existence in policymaking has potential to play a huge role in promoting well-being.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark267"><span class="s32">1</span></a>.

By the late 1960s <span class="s30">new views </span>of development started emerging. <span class="s33">Arthur Lewis </span>had seen development in the sense of <span class="s31">human freedom </span>in 1963 itself when he concluded that “the advantage of economic growth is not that wealth increases happiness, but that it increases the</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">range of human choice.” For him development means a freedom from ‘servitude’—mankind could be free to have choices to lead a life full of material goods or in spiritual contemplation (W. Arthur Lewis, <span class="s30">The Theory of Economic Growth, </span>Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1963, p. 420).</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">For <span class="s33">Dudley Seers </span>development meant more employment and equality besides a falling poverty (‘The Meaning of Development’, a paper presented at the 11th World Conference of the Society for International Development, New Delhi, 1969, p. 3). Dudley Seers was later supported by many other economists such as <span class="s33">Denis Goulet </span>(<span class="s30">The Cruel Choice: A New Concept in the Theory of Development, </span>Atheneum, New York, 1971, p. 23), Richard Brinkman (1995), P.

Wealth is important for human life. But to concentrate exclusively on it is wrong for two reasons. First, accumulating wealth is not necessary for the fulfillment of some important human choices....
