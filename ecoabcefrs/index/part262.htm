But this strategy may now be reaching its limits. After eight years of buying time (since the recession among the western economies, led by the US sub-prime crisis), there is still no sign that the affected companies are regaining their health, or even that the bad debt problem is being contained. Opposite to it, the stress on corporate sector and banks is continuing to intensify, and this in turn is taking a measurable toll on investment and credit. Moreover, efforts to offset these trends by providing macroeconomic stimulus are not proving sufficient—the increase in public investment has been more than offset by the fall in private investment, while until demonetisation monetary easing had not been transmitted to bank borrowers (as banks had been widening their margins instead). In these circumstances, it has become increasingly clear that the underlying debt problem will finally need to be addressed</a><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">71</span>, lest it derails India’s growth trajectory.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, the government has announced various measures in the <span class="s176">Union Budget 2017-18 </span>which are expected to boost the demand and investment sentiments in the economy—tax breaks, higher public investment, higher allocations to agriculture and infrastructure sectors, commitment to implement the GST and disciplined fiscal compliance. Though commodity prices in the international market, high chance of interest rate revision by the US central bank together with an expected inflation pressure (by the mid- 2017-18) are the areas of concerns in this regard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1366"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">1</span></a>. Here this should be noted that India will be a planned economy, was well-decided before this industrial policy which articulated for an <span class="s184">active role </span>of the state in the economy. The main objective of planning pointed out at this time was <span class="s184">poverty alleviation </span>by a judicious exploitation of the resources of the country. Only a ‘mixed economy’ did fit such a wish (<span class="s184">Conference of State Industry Ministers, 1938</span>).</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1367"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">2</span></a>. The nationalisation of industrial units allowed the government to enter the unreserved areas, which consequently increased its industrial presence. Though the nationalisation was provided a highly rational official reason of <span class="s184">greater public benefit, </span>the private sector always doubted it and took it as an insecurity and major unseen future hurdle in the expansion of private industries in the country.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1368"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">3</span></a>.

These industries which were set up after procuring <span class="s184">‘licences’ </span>from the government had fixed upper limits of their production known as <span class="s184">‘quota’ </span>and they needed to procure timely ‘permit’ (i.e., permission) for the supply of, raw materials—that is why such a name was given to the whole system.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1375"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">10</span></a>.

The FERA got executed on 1 January, 1974.

This limited permission was restricted to the areas where there was a need of foreign capital. Such MNCs entered the Indian economy with the help of a partner from India—the partner being the major one with 74 per cent shares in the subsidiaries set  up for by the  MNCs. The  MNCs invested via  <span class="s184">technology transfer route. </span>Basically, this was an attempt to make up for the loss being incurred by the FERA. This was the period when most of the MNCs had the chances to enter India. Once economic reforms started by 1991, many of them increased their holdings in the Indian subsidiaries with the Indian partner getting the minority shares or a total exit.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1383"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">18</span></a>. The permission of working was withdrawn in the case of the already functioning soft drink MNC the <span class="s184">Coca Cola</span>. The ongoing process of entry to the computer giant <span class="s184">IBM </span>and automobile major <span class="s184">Chrysller </span>was soon called off.

A total number of 95 industries had the compulsions of licencing till then. These industries belonged to Schedules B and C of the Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1385"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">20</span></a>. This was similar to the policy being followed by Gorbachev in the USSR with the similar fiscal results—a severe balance of payment (BoP) crisis by end 1980s and the early 1990s (J.

In 1985–86 there were just 64 industries under the compulsory licencing provision. By the fiscal 2015–16 the number remained five Publications Division, <span class="s186">India 2016 </span>(New Delhi: Government of India, 2016)). Though the numbers are still five, all these five industries have many internal areas which today carry no obligation of licencing. As for example, the electronic industry was under this provision and entrepreneurs needed licences to produce radio, tv, tape-recorder, etc., what to ask of mobile phones, computers, DVDs and i-pods. Now only those electronic goods carry licencing provision which are related to either the aero- space or the defence sectors—thus we see a great number of electronic industries freed from the licencing provision the item ‘electronics’ still remains under it. Similarly while ‘drug &amp; pharma’ still belong to the licenced industries, dozens of drugs and pharmaceuticals have been made free of it. The six industries have gone for high-level internal de-licencing since the reforms started.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1396"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">31</span></a>.

It should be noted that the South East Asian economies which faced financial crisis in 1996–97 all had allowed individual foreign investment in their share market. As the Indian security market was learning the art of regulation in its nascent phase, the government decided not to allow such foreign investment. The logic was vindicated after the South East Asian currency crisis when India had almost no shocks </span><span class="s184">(Ministry of Finance, Economic Survey 1996–97 (New Delhi: Government of India, 1997).</span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1398"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">33</span></a>. The delayed action by the government in the foreign exchange liberalisation was due to the delayed comfort the economy felt regarding the availability of foreign exchange.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1399"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">34</span></a>. This was another hurdle which the private sector industries have been</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">complaining about. As the industrial products were completely new to the Indian market and its consumers alike, the government followed this policy with the logic to provide enough time so that the products become domesticised i.e.,development of awareness about the product and its servicing, maintenance, etc. As for example, the MNC subsidiary Phillips India was allowed to produce a highly simple radio <span class="s184">Commandar </span>and <span class="s184">Jawan </span>models for comparatively longer periods of time then they were allowed to come up with the smaller fashionable radio sets or two-in-ones and three-in-ones. Such provisions hampered their full capacity utilisation as well as achieving the economy of scale had also been tougher. The new industrial policy of 1991 did away with such impediments. By that time, the Indian consumer as well as the market was fully aware of the modern industrial goods.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1400"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">35</span></a>. Combined with nationalisation, this <span class="s184">indirect route </span>to nationalisation failed to provide the confidence among the entrepreneurs that the industrial units they are intending to set up will be owned by them. This discouraged entrepreneurship in India while taking risk. The abolition of this compulsion was an indirect indication by the government of no more direct or indirect nationalisation in future. This has served the purpose, there is no doubt in it.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1401"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">36</span></a>. This nexus of the interests of the vested groups to the control regime of the economy has been beautifully elaborated by Rakesh Mohan in <span class="s186">‘Industrial Policy and Controls’ </span>pp. 92–123. He also points out that the control system perpetuating the academic and intellectual ideological leanings negated the very need for re-examination of the system. The ‘planners’ and the ‘bureaucrats’ were able to preserve their powers via the control regime did everything to maintain the status quo, Rakesh Mohan further adds.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1402"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">37</span></a>.

It should be noted that <span class="s184">‘reform with the human face’ </span>was not a new slogan or call given by the UPA Government but this was the same slogan with which the reform programme was launched by the Rao-Manmohan Government in 1991— it has only been ‘re-called back’ by the new government with a new committment to live it up.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1404"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">39</span></a>. Point should be noted that <span class="s186">Bharat Niraman </span>has been the only time-bound programme of infrastructure building in rural areas which is supposed to be completed within four years (the time left out of the total term of the Government when the programme was launched). The UPA naturally, tries to make it a political statement and a point for the next General Elections— development becoming an issue of real politics.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1405"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">40</span></a>. Publication Division, <span class="s186">India 1991 </span>(New Delhi: Government of India, 1992).</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1406"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">41</span></a>. The de-reservation of industries had allowed the private sector to enter the areas hitherto reserved for the Central Government. It means in the coming times in the unreserved areas the PSUs were going to face the international class competitiveness posed by the new private companies. To face up the challenges the existing PSUs needed new kind of technological, managerial and marketing strategies (similar to the private companies). For all such preparations there was a requirement of huge capital. The government thought to partly fund the required capital out of the proceeds of disinvestment of the PSUs. In this way disinvestment should be viewed in India as a way of increasing investment in the divested PSUs (which we see taking place in the cases of BALCO, VSNL, etc.).</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1407"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">42</span></a>. Right since 1991 when disinvestment began, governments have been using the disinvestment proceeds to manage fiscal deficits in the budget at least up to 2000–01. From 2000–01 to 2002–03 some of the proceeds went for some social sector reforms or for labour security. After 2003 India established National Investment Fund to which the proceeds of disinvestment automatically flow and is not regarded as a <span class="s184">capital receipt </span>of the Union Government. This idea of Indian experiment with disinvestment was articulated by <span class="s184">Sach, Varshney and Bajpai, India in the Era of Economic Reforms</span>, pp. 62–63.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1408"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">43</span></a>. As was done by <span class="s186">Margaret Thatcher </span>in the UK in the mid-1980s. Her brand of privatisation was driven by the conviction that government control makes PSUs inherently less efficient and privatisation therefore improves its economic efficiency and is good for the consumers. However, this idea has been rejected around the world on the empirical bases. <span class="s184">A PSUs could also have comparable economic efficiency even being under full government control. </span>This was followed by Mrs. Thatcher (1979–90) forcefully in Great Britain conjoined with the supply-side economics as was done by Ronald Reagan (1981–89) in the United States as discussed by P.A. Samuelson and W.D. Nordhaus, <span class="s184">Economics </span>(New DelhI; Tata McGraw Hill, 2005), p. 703.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1409"><span style=" color: #BF50B5; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">44</span></a>.
