As development responsibilities of the government were very high, there was a need of huge funds in rupee as well as in foreign currency forms. India faced continuous crises in managing the required fund to support its Five Year Plans—neither foreign funds came nor internal resources could be mobilised in sufficient amount. (Due to lower tax collections, weaker banks that too privately owned, and negligible saving rate, etc.)</a><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2330" class="s335">28</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">By the late 1960s, the government headed for deficit financing and from the 1970s onwards, India started going for higher and higher fiscal deficits and became more and more dependent on increased deficit financing with every fresh year. We may classify dificit financing in India into three phases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark68" class="s337" name="bookmark2232">The First Phase (1947–1970) </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark68" class="s338">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This phase had no concept of deficit financing and the deficits were shown as Budgetary Deficits. Major aspects of this phase were—</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Trying to borrow from inside and outside the economy but unable to meet the target.</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">In the 1950s, a serious attempt was made to increase tax collections and check revenue expenditures to be ultimately able to emerge as a surplus revenue budget economy. But huge cost was paid in the form of tax evasion, rise in corruption, stagnating standard of life and a neglected</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">social sector.</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Taking recourse to heavy borrowings from the RBI and finally nationalisation of banks so that their money could be used by the government to support the plans. This not only increased the interest burden of the governments but also ruptured the whole financial system in coming years—banks did not remain commercial entities and became part of the government’s political statement.</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Establishing giant PSUs with higher revenue expenditures (salaries) which increased the revenue expenditures of the future governments when the pensions and the PFs needed to be serviced.</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Unable to go for the required level of investment even after taking recourse to all the above given means.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark69" class="s337" name="bookmark2233">The Second Phase (1970–1991) </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark69" class="s338">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is considered the period of deficit financing, follow up of unsound fundamentals of economics and finally culminating in severe financial crisis by the year 1990–91.

Ultimately, the responsibility of profit or loss did not remain the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">onus of the officers, thus making them centres of intentional losses and an institutionalised centre of corruption; etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #808908;">(iv) </span>The governments have failed on both the fronts—checking population rise and mass employment generation—the burden of different <span class="s333">subsidies </span>went on  increasing  making them unmanageable and highly illogical.

The outcome was a burdened police force and lagging judicial set up.</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(vi) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The plan expenditure which governments were going for were through investments in the PSUs which were not committed to profit motive, deficit financing for the PSUs was not based on sound economics. Majority of the plan expenditure in a sense turned out to be non- economic, i.e., non-plan expenditure at the end.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;    text-align: justify;"><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2331" class="s58" name="bookmark2234">Due to the above-given reasons, it was tough to say whether it was sound to go for huge fiscal deficits in India.</a><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2331" class="s335">29</a></p><p style="padding-top: 17pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark70" class="s337" name="bookmark2235">The Third Phase (1991 onwards) </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark70" class="s338">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This started with the initiation of the economic reforms process under the conditionalities put forth by the IMF (controlling fiscal deficit was one amongst them).
