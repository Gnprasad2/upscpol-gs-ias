The reforms were historic and were going to change the very face and the nature of the economy in the coming times. The reforms and the related programmes are still going on with changing emphasis and dimensions, but they are criticised as being slow ever since the UPA Government came to power in May 2004. Back in the mid-1980s, the governments had taken its first steps to economic reforms.</p><p class="s68" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part114.htm#bookmark743" class="s58" name="bookmark692">While the reforms of the 1980s witnessed rather limited deregulation and ‘partial liberalisation of only a few aspects of the existing control regime, the reforms started in early 1990s in the fields of industries, trade, investment and later to include agriculture, were much ‘wider and deeper’.</a><span style=" color: #3B70F6; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">8</span> <span class="p">Though liberal policies were announced by the governments during the reforms of the 1980s itself, with the slogan of ‘economic reforms’, it was only launched with full conviction in the early 1990s. But the reforms of the 1980s, which were under the influence of the famous </span><i>‘Washington Consensus’ </i><a href="part114.htm#bookmark744" class="s58">ideology had a crippling impact on the economy. The whole Seventh Plan (1985–90) promoted further relaxation of market regulations with heavy external borrowings to increase exports (as the thrust of the policy reform). Though the thrust increased the growth rate led by higher industrial growth (riding on costly imports supported by foreign borrowings, which the industries would not be able to pay back and service), it also led to a substantial increase in foreign indebtedness that played a major role in the BoP crisis of 1991.</a><span style=" color: #3B70F6; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">9</span> <a href="part114.htm#bookmark745" class="s58">The crisis was immediated by the First Gulf War (1991) which had two-pronged negative impact on the Indian foreign exchange (forex) reserves. First, the war led the oil prices to go upward forcing India to use its forex reserves in comparatively shorter period and second, the private remittances from Indians working in the Gulf region fell down fast (due to their emergency evacuation)—both the crises were induced by a single cause, i.e., the Gulf War. But the balance of payments crisis also reflected deeper problems of rising foreign debt, a fiscal deficit of over 8 per cent of the GDP and a hyper- inflation (over 13 per cent) situation.</a><a href="part114.htm#bookmark745" class="s67">10</a><a name="bookmark693">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark694">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark695">The minority government of the time had taken a highly bold and controversial step in the form of economic reforms criticised throughout the 1990s by one and all—right from the opposition in the Parliament, to the communist parties, to the industrial houses, the business houses, media, experts and by the masses also. By now as the benefits of the reforms have accrued to many, the criticism has somewhat calmed down, but still the reform process is considered as ‘anti-poor’ and ‘pro-rich’ by at least the masses—the people who decide the political mandate for the country to rule. At least one belief is followed by everybody, i.e., the benefits of reforms are not tickling to the masses (the </a><span class="s64">‘aam aadami’</span><a href="part114.htm#bookmark746" class="s58">) with the desirable pace.</a><span style=" color: #3B70F6; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">11 </span>The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">need of the hour is to go for ‘distributive growth’, though the reform has led the economy to a higher growth path.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark55" class="s65" name="bookmark696">Obligatory Reform </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark55" class="s66">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part114.htm#bookmark747" class="s58" name="bookmark697">Similar reform process started by some other economies since the 1980s were voluntary decisions of the concerned countries. But in the case of India it was an involuntary decision taken by the government of the time in the wake of the BoP crisis. Under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme of the IMF, countries get external currency support from the fund to mitigate their BoP crisis, but such supports have some obligatory conditionalities put on the economy to be fulfilled. There are no set rules of such conditions already available with the IMF, though they are devised and prescribed to the BoP- crisis-ridden economy at the time of need. A point needs to be referred here is that the conditionalities put upon India were of the nature which required all the economic measures to be formulated by them. It means that the reforms India carried or is carrying out at present were neither formulated by India nor mandated by the public. Yes, there was a large section of experts inside and outside the government who believed in similar economic measures to bring the economy on the right path. Some of them were arguing the same since the 1970s, while many other experts believed in them since the mid- 1980s.</a><span style=" color: #3B70F6; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">12 </span>But why after all was the Rao-Manmohan Government credited to start the reform process in India? It is because they thought it suitable to follow and make it politically possible in India. Imagine, a government proposing to sell the state-owned companies to the private sector or closing them down in a country which has been convinced that these companies will be the ‘temples of modern India’. The masses were convinced that the government has bowed down to the dictats of the IMF, the imperialist forces, the multinationals, etc. Even today such feelings are there in several quarters of the economy. The politics of economic reforms damaged India more than the reform has benefitted the country. It would not be an exaggeration if we conclude that economic reforms had no political consensus. Political parties in India are divided on the issue of reforms—the parties together with the masses lack the level of political maturity required for the success of the reform programme. It is right, democratic maturity comes to a multi-party</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">political system, but it takes time. It takes even more time where masses are unaware and ignorant. The emotional issues of religion, caste, etc., play their own roles in such situations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <span class="s68">IMF conditions </span>put forth for India were as under:</p><p class="s70" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Devaluation of the rupee by 22 per cent (which was effected in two phases and the Indian rupee fell down from Rs. 21 to Rs. 27 per US Dollar).</span></p><p class="s70" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Drastic reduction in the peak import tariff from the prevailing level of 130 per cent to 30 per cent (India completed it by 2000–01 itself and now it is voluntarily cut to the level of 15 per cent).</span></p><p class="s70" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Excise duties (i.e., CENVAT now) to be hiked by 20 per cent to neutralise the revenue short falls due to the custom cut (a major tax reform programme was launched to streamline, simplify and modernise the Indian tax structure which is still going on).</span></p><p class="s70" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">All government expenditure to be cut down by 10 per cent, annually (i.e., cutting the cost of running the government and denotes, interests, pays, pension PF and subsidies. A pressure on the government to consolidate the fiscal deficit and go for fiscal prudence).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Though India was able to pay back its IMF dues in time, the structural reform of the economy was launched to fulfil the above-given conditions of the IMF. The ultimate goal of the IMF was to help India bring about equilibirium in its BoP situation in the short-term and go for macroeconomic and structural adjustments so that in future the economy faces no such crisis.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part114.htm#bookmark748" class="s58" name="bookmark698">There was enough scope for the critics to criticise India’s economic reforms as prescribed and dictated by the IMF. The process of economic reforms in India had to face severe criticism from almost every quarter of the economy concerned, although the reforms were aimed to boost growth and deliver competitiveness to the economy.</a><a href="part114.htm#bookmark748" class="s67">13</a></p><p style="padding-top: 17pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark56" class="s65" name="bookmark699">Reform Measures </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark56" class="s66">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The economic reform programme, that India launched, consisted of <span class="s64">two</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">categories of measures:</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part96.htm">1.
