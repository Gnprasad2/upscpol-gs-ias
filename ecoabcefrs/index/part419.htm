Meanwhile, RTAs (Regional Trade Agreements) are efforts by nations aimed at deepening economic relations, usually with neighbouring countries, and tend to be <span class="s299">largely political </span>in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">nature. With the multilateral trade negotiations process under the WTO being a painfully slow one requiring broad-based consensus, RTAs have progressively assumed greater importance and a growing share in international trade.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">While RTAs are broadly <span class="s299">compliant </span>with WTO mandates and remain broadly <span class="s299">supportive </span>of the WTO process, they remain <span class="s296">second-best </span>solutions that are discriminatory in nature against non-members and are inefficient as low cost producing non-members lose out to members. While bilateral RTAs have no equity considerations, mega-regional trading groups may not necessarily be equitable if membership is diverse and small countries may lose out either wayâ€”if they are part of it they may not have much say and if they are not, they may stand to lose.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">India has always stood for an open, equitable, predictable, non- discriminatory and rule-based international trading system and views RTAs as building blocks in the overall objective of trade liberalization as well as complementing the multilateral trading system under the WTO.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1972">By </a><span class="s298">March 2017</span>, India had signed 12 FTAs (Free Trade Agreements) and 6 PTAs (Preferential Trade Agreements) and all of these were in force.
