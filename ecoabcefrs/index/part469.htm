It has therefore become ‘dysfunctional’,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #808908;">(ii) </span>Suggests for <span class="s333">redefining the roles </span>of the Planning Commission (PC) and the Finance Ministry (FM). According to which the PC should be responsible for formulation of the five-year plan and the task of firming up the annual budgets should be entrusted to the FM.</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The PC should dispense with the exercise of approving annual plans of states and it could hold a strategy or review meeting with representatives of the states.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #808908;">(iv) </span>Public expenditures should be split into <span class="s333">capital </span>and <span class="s333">revenue</span></p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">expenditures.</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Public expenditure should have ‘management approach’ based on measurable ‘outcomes’, indicating that the reponsibility should be assigned to the FM.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s334">Analysis of the Situation: </span>While the need for looking beyond the budget is well accepted, there are many factors raising doubts on the ‘efficacy’ and ‘relevance’ of the five-year plans as the instrument. The division of expenditure between <span class="s333">Plan </span>and <span class="s333">non-Plan </span>is artificial and creates problems, such as :</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #808908;">(i) </span>Plan expenditure tends to get priority especially when austerity and expenditure reduction has to be done periodically for fiscal consolidation. Non-Plan expenditure gets the <span class="s334">cut </span>even if it is vitally needed for economic development, an example is budget provision for maintenance of assets such as hospitals, schools and irrigation dams already created under Plan, but whose maintenance is treated as non- Plan.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #808908;">(ii) </span>Review and implementation of schemes is another area of direct responsibility for the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The Finance Minister himself had, in the budget speech for 2005–06, promised to ensure that programmes and schemes were not allowed to continue indefinitely from one Plan period to another without an independent and in-depth evaluation. The Planning Commission, serving as the <span class="s333">focal point for Plan allocations</span>, dilutes the role of the Finance Ministry in this case.</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">‘Output’ and ‘Outcome Budgeting’ was introduced by the Central Government from the Budget for 2005–06. Non-Plan expenditure remains out of its purview. This means, for example, the outcome of expenditure on running schools and hospitals will not be evaluated. This again is another fallout of the artificial division into Plan and non-Plan.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">This classification used to adversely affect the whole budget process, formulation and implementation. Looking at this anomaly, the Government switched over from the ‘plan’ and ‘non-plan’ classification of expenditure to ‘revenue’ and ‘capital’ since the fiscal 2017-18 (as announced in the <span class="s334">Union Budget 2017-18</span>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part470.htm">Revenue                                      </a><a class="toc0" href="part471.htm">Receipts                                      </a><a class="toc1" href="part472.htm">(i) Loan Recovery</a><a class="toc1" href="part473.htm">(ii) Borrowings by the Government</a><a class="toc1" href="part474.htm">(iii) Other Receipts by the Government</a><a class="toc2" href="part475.htm">(i) Loan Disbursals by the Government</a><a class="toc2" href="part476.htm">(ii) Loan Repayments by the Government</a><a class="toc2" href="part477.htm">(iii) Plan Expenditure of the Government</a><a class="toc2" href="part478.htm">(iv) Capital Expenditures on Defence by the Government</a><a class="toc2" href="part479.htm">(v) General Services</a><a class="toc2" href="part480.htm">(vi) Other Liabilities of the Government</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part468.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part470.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
