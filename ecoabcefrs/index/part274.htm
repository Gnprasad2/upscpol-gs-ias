In this market, money is traded between individuals or groups (i.e., financial institutions, banks, government, companies, etc.), who are either </a><span class="s200">cash-surplus </span>or <span class="s200">cash-scarce</span>. Trading is done on a rate known as <span class="s200">discount rate </span><a href="part283.htm#bookmark1532" class="s58">which is determined by the market and guided by the availability of and demand for the cash in the day-to-day trading.</a><span style=" color: #FFAE0E; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">4</span><span class="s202"> </span>The ‘repo rate’ of the time (announced by the RBI) works as the guiding rate for the current ‘discount rate’.

In the money market the <span class="s200">financial assets</span><a href="part283.htm#bookmark1533" class="s58">, which have quick conversion quality into money and carry minimal transaction cost, are also traded.</a><span style=" color: #FFAE0E; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">5 </span>Money market may be <span class="s200">defined </span>as a market where short-term lending and borrowing take place between the cash-surplus and cash-scarce sides.<a name="bookmark1492">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The market operates in both ‘organised’ and ‘unorganised’ channels in India. Starting from the ‘person-to-person’ mode and converting into ‘telephonic transaction’, it has now gone <span class="s200">online </span>in the age of internet and information technology. The transactions might take place through the intermediaries (known as brokers) or directly between the trading sides.</p><p class="s202" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Need for Money Market: <span class="p">Income generation (i.e., growth) is the most essential requiremnt of any economic system. In the modern industrial economies creation of productive assets is not an easy task, as it requires</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">investible capital of long-term nature. Long-term capital can be raised either through bank loans, corporate bonds, debentures or shares (i.e., from the capital market). But once a productive asset has been created and production starts there comes the need of another kind of capital, to meet the day-to-day shortfalls of working capital. It means that only setting-up of firms does not guarantee production as these firms keep facing <span class="s200">fund mismatches </span>in the day- to-day production process. Such funds are required only for a short period (days, fortnights or few months) and are needed to meet shortfalls in working capital requirements. This requires creation of a different segment of the financial market which can cater to the short-term requirements of such funds for the eneterprises—known as the <span class="s202">money market </span>or the <span class="s202">working capital market. </span>The short-term period is defined as upto 364 days.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The crucial role money market plays in an economy is proved by the fact that if only a few lakhs or crores of rupees of working capital is not met in time, it can push a firm or business enterprise to go for lock-out, which has been set- up with thousands of crores of capital. If lock-out happens, the firm might default in its payments, losing its age-old credit-worthiness, consequently creating a chain of negatives in the economic system. This is why it is essential for every economy to organise a strong and vibrant money market which has wider geographic presence (the reason why it is today internet- based).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1493"><span class="s202">Money Market in India: </span></a><a href="part283.htm#bookmark1534" class="s58">The organised form of money market in India is just close to three decades old.

Their activities are not regulated</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">like the organised money market, but they are recognised by the government. In recent years, some of them have been included under the regulated organised market (for example, the NBFCs were put under the regulatory control of the RBI in 1997). The unorganised money market in India may be divided into three differing categories:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #FFAE0E;">(i) </span><span class="s202">Unregulated Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries: </span>Unregulated Non- Banking Financial Intermediaries are functioning in the form of <span class="s200">chit funds, nidhis </span>(operate in South India, which lend to only their members) and loan companies. They charge very high interest rates (i.e., 36 to 48 per cent per annum), thus, are exploitative in nature and have selective reach in the economy.</p><p class="s203" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <b>Indigenous Bankers: </b><span style=" color: #000F67;">Indigenous bankers receive deposits and  lend money in the capacity of an individual or a private firms.

The provision of repo and the reverse repo have been able to serve the liquidity evenness in the economy as the banks are able to get the required amount of funds out of it, and they can park surplus idle funds through it.
