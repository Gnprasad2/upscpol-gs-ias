Indicative Planning</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the following two decades after the soviet planning commenced, the idea of planning got attention from the democratic world. A time came when some such economies started national planning. As they were neither state economies nor communist/socialist political systems, the nature of their planning was different from the command economies. Such planning has been termed as indicative planning by economists and experts. The identifying features of indicative planning may be summed up as under:</p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">every economy following the indicative planning were mixed economies.</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark360">(ii) </a><a href="part50.htm#bookmark378" class="s58">unlike a centrally  planned  economy  (countries following  imperative planning) indicative planning works through the market (price system) rather than replaces it.</a><a href="part50.htm#bookmark378" class="s36">15</a></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">side by side setting numerical/quantitative targets (similar to the practice in the imperative planning) a set of economic policies of indicative nature is also announced by the economies to realise the plan targets.</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">the indicative nature of economic policies, which are announced in such planning, basically encourage or discourage the private sector in its process of economic decision making.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After converting to a mixed economy by the mid-1940s, France</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark361">commenced its first six year plan in 1947, which got popularity as the </a><span class="s40">Monnet Plan </span><a href="part50.htm#bookmark379" class="s58">(he was the first chairman of the General Planning Commission and the then Cabinet Minister for planning in France).</a><span style=" color: #EF826E; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">16 </span>Later, Monnet Plan became synonymous with indicative planning. This plan is also sometimes described as the <span class="s39">basic sector planning </span>as the government had selected eight basic industries as the core of development in which the nature of planning was almost <span class="s39">imperative, </span><a href="part50.htm#bookmark380" class="s58">i.e., under state monopoly (these sectors were owned by the private sector till 1944 when France went for their nationalisation).</a><span style=" color: #EF826E; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">17</span><span class="s37"> </span><a href="part50.htm#bookmark381" class="s58">Other economic activities were open for private participation for which indicative kind of policy-planning was essential. France as well as Japan have followed indicative planning with great success. It was in 1965 that the UK commenced such a planning with the National Plan and abandoned in 1966 after being overtaken by events (a balance of payment crisis resulting in a deflationary package of measures). Since then the UK never went for planning.</a><a href="part50.htm#bookmark381" class="s36">18</a><a name="bookmark362">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark363">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Though the first use of economic planning as an instrument of economic progress was done by the USA (with the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1916 at the regional level), it never went for a <span class="s39">formal </span>national planning. In the 1940s, some economists had suggested in favour of the use of national planning. We may have a reflex of indicative planning in the USA if we look at the <span class="s39">Presidential Reports </span>which come after regular intervals. These reports are just ‘benchmarks’ in the area of resource utilisation and governmental announcements of its objectives—basically trying to motivate the private sector towards the area of public objectives. The indicative planning as it is practised by the mixed economy, any growth target could only be achieved once the public and the private enterprises worked in tandem. This is why besides the plan targets, the governments need to announce some set of indicative policies to encourage and motivate the private sector to accelerate their economic activities in the direction of the plan targets.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">After the Second World War, almost all the newly independent countries adopted the route of planned development. Though they followed an overall model of the indicative planning, many of them had serious inclination towards imperative planning. As in the case of India, the heavy bias towards imperative planning could only be reformed once the process of economic</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">reforms was started in 1991.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Today, as there are mostly only mixed economies around the world, any country’s development planning has to be only of the indicative type. After the revival of the role and the need of market in promoting growth and development via the Washington Consensus (1985), the World Trade Organisation (1995) and the Santiago/New Consensus (1998) only indicative planning has remained possible with the state playing only a marginal role in the economy, especially in the areas of social importance (i.e., nutrition, healthcare, drinking water, education, social security, etc.).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There are still many <span class="s37">other types </span>of planning depending upon the point of view we are looking at. For example, from the territorial point of view, planning could be <span class="s40">regional </span>or <span class="s40">national. </span>From the political point of view planning could be <span class="s40">central, state </span>or <span class="s40">local. </span>Similarly, from the participatory point of view, planning has been categorised into <span class="s40">centralised </span>and <span class="s40">decentralised. </span>Again, from the temporal point of view planning could be <span class="s40">long-term </span>or <span class="s40">short-term </span>(in relative sense). Finally, from the value point of view planning could be <span class="s40">economic </span>or <span class="s40">developmental.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">A major classification of planning is done on the basis of societal emphasis. The type of planning which gives less emphasis upon the social and institutional dimensions is known as <span class="s40">systems planning. </span>In such planning, the planners just search for the best possible results in relation to the established goals giving less importance to issues like caste, creed, religion, region, language, marriage, family, etc. Opposed to it, the <span class="s40">normative planning </span>gives due importance to the socio-institutional factors. This is a planning from social-technical point of view, but only suitable for a country which has lesser degree of social diversities (naturally, not fit for the Indian conditions). But in the coming years there was a shift in the very thinking of policymakers. The <span class="s39">Economic Survey 2010–11 </span>is probably the first document of the Government of India which advocates the need for a <span class="s40">normative approach </span>to planning in India. It is believed that until a programme/scheme run by the governments are not able to connect with the customs, traditions and ethos of the population, their acceptability will not be of the desired level among the target population. Establishing an empathic relationship between the programmes/schemes and target population is now considered an important aspect of planning and policymaking. Such a change in the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: justify;">thinking is based on the experiences of India and other countries of the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In January 2015, the Government of India replaced the erstwhile body, Planning Commission, by the <span class="s39">NYTl Aayog </span>(a policy <span class="s39">think tank</span>). If we look into the functions and guiding principles of the new body we come to know that India has officially moved towards <span class="s40">normative planning</span>— the new body has to follow a <span class="s39">development model </span>which is ‘all round, all pervasive, all inclusive and holistic’. In this process the NITI Aayog has been further asked to enable the country to draw on the vitality and energy of the bedrock of our <span class="s39">ethos, culture </span>and <span class="s39">sustenance</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The <span class="s40">Economic Survey 2015–16 </span>points out how the government has come to recognise the importance of influencing <span class="s39">social norms </span>in a wide variety of sectors, such as:</p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">persuading the rich to give up subsidies they do not need,</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">reducing social prejudices against girls,</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">educating people about the health externalities of open defecation, and</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">encouraging citizens to keep public spaces clean.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Today, governments all over the world have embarked on systematic ways of studying how to promote <span class="s39">behavioural change</span>. The importance and need of behavioural change were highlighted by the <span class="s39">World Development Report 2015 </span>(World Bank), too. All such policy interventions are examples of <span class="s37">normative </span>policymaking.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Economic planning is classified into more types—<span class="s40">sectoral </span>and <span class="s40">spatial. </span>In sectoral planning, the planners emphasise the specific sector of the economy, i.e., agriculture, industry or the services. In spatial planning development is seen in the spatial framework. The spatial dimensions of development might be defined by the pressure and requirements of national economic development. Indian planning has been essentially —single level economic planning with a greater reliance on the sectoral approach though the multi- level regional and normative dimensions are being increasingly emphasised since the early 1990s.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark364"><span class="s44">1</span></a>.
