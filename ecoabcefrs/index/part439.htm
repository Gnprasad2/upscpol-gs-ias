A year later, at its official launch in Beijing, 21 Asian nations, including China, had signed up to be the foundation members. Currently another 21 nations— including Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Germany and France—have expressed a desire to join as well. An interesting applicant is Taiwan—which signed up just before the April 1, 2015 deadline—although issues around its membership name may complicate the deal. Russia also left it to the last minute to fire in its application. Chinese media reported that only 30 of the 42 member applications have been accepted. The Chinese foreign ministry has said that the full list of countries approved as founding members would be released by mid-April 2015.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The AIIB is aimed at providing finance to infrastructure projects in the Asia region, as a multilateral instituion. It is planned to operate broadly in the same manner as existing multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). While much of the debate is centred on whether the AIIB will complement or compete with existing organisations, it is intended to be more a commercial bank—with nations as shareholders, than a purely development aid institution. The AIIB will start with an authorised <span class="s311">capital base </span>of US$ 1 billion to be enhanced to <span class="s311">US $ 100 billion</span>.</p><p class="s311" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part439.htm#bookmark2071" class="s58" name="bookmark2047">Experts have termed it as a rival for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which are regarded as dominated by developed countries like the United States.</a><span style=" color: #E1775D; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">21</span> <a href="part439.htm#bookmark2072" class="s58">The United Nations has addressed the launch of the AIIB as ‘scaling up financing for sustainable development’ and for the concern of Global Economic Governance.</a><a href="part439.htm#bookmark2072" class="s310">22</a><a name="bookmark2048">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">As per the experts and analysts, there are <span class="s311">several factors </span>which are behind such an initiative coming from China. Major ones are as given below:</p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The Chinese government has been frustrated with what it regards as the slow pace of reforms and governance, and wants greater input in global established institutions like the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank which it claims are dominated by American, European and Japanese interests.</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The ADB, a Manila-based regional development bank designed to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part439.htm#bookmark2073" class="s58" name="bookmark2049">facilitate economic development in Asia, estimated in a report that developing Asian countries have an infrastructure demand of about US$ 8 trillion between 2010–2020— $2.5 trillion for roads and railroads, $4.1 trillion for power plants and transmission, $1.1 trillion for telecommunications, and $0.4 trillion for water and sanitation investments.</a><a href="part439.htm#bookmark2073" class="s310">23</a></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Oxford Economics reported that by 2025, the region will constitute 60 per cent of global infrastructure investment, with China’s share alone is expected to increase from around 22 per cent to 36 per cent over the next decade.</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Despite the significant economic growth enjoyed by countries such as China, India, and South Korea in recent decades, many countries among the developing Asian regions are still mired in poverty, suffering from a profound lack of access to modern-day necessities such as sanitation, a reliable power grid, and adequate transportation and communications networks.</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">It is believed that the new bank could allow Chinese capital to finance these projects and allow it a greater role to play in the economic development of the region commensurate with its growing economic and political clout.</span></p><p class="s311" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2050">Stand of the USA and Japan: </a><a href="part439.htm#bookmark2074" class="s58">The United States, Japan and Canada remain firmly on the sidelines despite a number of their closest allies and partners recently breaking ranks. The US has argued that the AIIB doubles up on existing organisations, such as the World Bank and ADB, but doubts it will have adequate transparency and governance standards. However, it appears the US may be softening its stance. Japan has said it would not be bound by a deadline not ruling out the possibility of joining in. Though the US has been openly opposing this move some experts view that the US in place of opposing it should work with it. Experts have suggested that China is promoting a solution to the shortage of infrastructure capital in Asia and there is nothing wrong in supporting it.</a><a href="part439.htm#bookmark2074" class="s310">24</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s311">Size of the AIIB: </span>The AIIB will be one of the largest development banks, but still a fair bit smaller than the European Development Bank, World Bank and ADB. It will start off about the same size as the <span class="s313">BRICS Development Bank</span>,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">which was formed by Chinese initiation with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa in 2014.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Based on the lending capital ratios of the World Bank and European Development Bank —the AIIB could extend loans for infrastructure spending at around 100 per cent to 175 per cent of its subscribed capital. This would mean having outstanding loans of up to $US175 billion. With Public Private Partnerships and increased subscriptions, considerably larger amounts could leveraged for projects in the future.</p><p class="s311" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An edge to China: <span class="p">The Bank is supposed to give China an edge in the global economy, major ones are—</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The AIIB will be a better way for China to deploy its massive foreign exchange reserves which are currently earning next to nothing in US Treasury bonds. China believes that the commercial financing of infrastructure differentiates the AIIB from the likes of the ADB which places a greater emphasis on poverty reduction.</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The AIIB also supports China’s strategic interests in its hugely ambitious ‘Silk Road Economic Belt’ policy.</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">By exporting technology, transferring development know-how, and facilitating industrialisation using Chinese long-term finance to the under-developed economies, China will not only find a bigger market, promote prosperity of all nations along the ‘Belt and Road’, but also diversify its foreign asset portfolio.</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">It will make China emerge a much bigger global power player which is supposed to be keen to challenge America’s long-established strategy of institutionalising power in a rules-based order. The case of the AIIB shows that China now seeks to define this order for itself, with the battle for influence in Asia increasingly fought through rules and institutions.</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The so-called ‘rules based order’ was set up after the 2nd World War through policies such as the Bretton Woods agreement which established US dominated organisations such as the World Bank and IMF in which China plays a very small role.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Members of multilateral development banks, historically, enjoy benefit such as getting ahead of the queue for loans and enjoying a greater chance of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">success for national firms competing for project work. Put bluntly, without signing up it is highly likely that a large chunk of the billions of dollars worth of work on offer will simply be doled out to Chinese companies. Before conclusive remarks could be drawn, it will better to keep watching the future developments regarding the new bank.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2051"><span style=" color: #E1775D; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%; ">1</span></a>.

For the new international monetary system, basically two plans were presented in the meeting—one by the US delegation led by <span class="s315">Harry D. White </span>(of the US Treasury) and the British delegation led by <span class="s315">John Meynard Keynes. </span>It was the US plan which was ultimately agreed upon.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">J.M. Keynes had proposed a more impartial, practical and over-arching idea via his plan at Bretton Woods. His suggestions basically included three things:</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s316">(i) </span>Proposal to set up an International Clearing Union (ICU), a central bank of all central banks, with its own currency (Keynes named this currency <span class="s315">‘bancor’</span>)— to mitigate the balance of payment crises of member nations.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">This bank was supposed to penalise (<span class="s315">no such provision in the IMF</span>) the countries holding trade surpluses (with a global tax of one per cent per month) on the ground that such countries were keeping world demand low by under- purchasing the products produced by other countries. The corpus collected via this tax was to be used to maintain an international buffer stock of primary goods (i.e., food articles)—to be used in the periods of food shortages among the member nations. (<span class="s315">In place, under the IMF provisions trade deficit countries are penalised</span>.)</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s316">(ii) </span>For the reconstruction of war-devastated Europe, a <span class="s315">fund </span>was to be set up, on the basis of this plan for Relief and Reconstruction (in place of it the US- sponsored <span class="s315">Marshall Plan </span>took care of the needs of Europe).</p><p class="s316" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span class="s14">There was a proposal of creating Commodity Buffer Stock to be operated by an International Trade Organization (ITO). This stock of primary goods was to be used to stabilise their prices in the international market.</span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">The operation of this ITO making purchases when the world prices were low and selling when the prices became high. The buffer stock operations, however, were to be helpful to the poor countries, Keynes was primarily interested in stabilising the input prices of the rich countries. (<span class="s315">Though the charter of the ITO</span></p><p class="s315" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">was drawn up and other formalities completed, it was never born because of US opposition<span class="s14">.) </span>For further readings see <span class="s14">D.
