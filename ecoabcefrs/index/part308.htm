But the failure of a bank may have far greater damaging impact on an economy than any other kind of business or commercial activity. Basically, modern economies are heavily dependent on banks today</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1621">than in the past—banks are today called the backbone of economies. Healthy functioning of banks is today essential for the proper functioning of an economy. As credit creation (</a><span class="s210">i.e., loan disbursals</span>) of banks are highly risky business, the depositors’ money depends on the banks’ quality of lending. More importantly, the whole payment system, public as well as private, depends on banks. A bank’s failure has the potential of creating chaos in an economy. This is why governments of the world pay special attention to the regulatory aspects of the banks. Every regulatory provision for banks tries to achieve a simple equation, i.e., <span class="s210">“how the banks should maximise their credit creation by minimising the risk and continue functioning permanently”. </span>In the banking business risks are always there and cannot be made ‘zero’—as any loan forwarded to any individual or firm (irrespective of their credit- worthiness) has the risk of turning out to be a bad debt (<span class="s210">i.e., NPA in India</span>)— the probability of this being 50 per cent. But banks must function so that economies can function. Finally, the central banks of the world started devising tools to minimise the risks of banking at <span class="s211">one hand </span>and providing cushions (shock-absorbers) to the banks at the <span class="s211">other hand </span><a href="part320.htm#bookmark1710" class="s58">so that banks do not go bust (i.e., shut down after becoming bankrupt).

Tier II capital is secondary bank capital (the <span class="s211">second most reliable </span>forms of capital). This is related to Tier 1 Capital. This capital is a measure of a bank’s financial strength from a regulator’s point of view. It consists of accumulated after-tax surplus of retained earnings, revaluation reserves of fixed assets and long-term holdings of equity securities, general loan-loss reserves, hybrid (debt/equity) capital instruments, and subordinated debt and undisclosed reserves.</p><p class="s213" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1635">Tier 3 Capital: </a><span class="p">A term used to describe the capital adequacy of a bank— considered the </span><i>tertiary capital </i><a href="part320.htm#bookmark1722" class="s58">of the banks which are used to meet/support market risk, commodities risk and foreign currency risk.

They consider common equity and retained earnings as the predominant component of capital (as the past), but they restrict inclusion of items such as deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing rights and investments in financial institutions to no more than 15 per cent of the common equity component. These rules aim to improve the <span class="s211">quantity </span>and <span class="s211">quality </span>of the capital.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">While the key capital ratio has been raised to 7 per cent of risky assets, according to the new norms, Tier-I capital that includes common equity and perpetual preferred stock will be raised from 2 to 4.5 per cent starting in phases from January 2013 to be completed by January 2015. In addition, banks will have to set aside another 2.5 per cent as a <span class="s211">contingency </span>for future stress. Banks that fail to meet the buffer would be unable to pay dividends, though they will not be forced to raise cash.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The new norms are based on renewed focus of central bankers on ‘macro- prudential stability’. The global financial crisis following the crisis in the US sub-prime market has prompted this change in approach. The previous set of guidelines, popularly known as <span class="s211">Basel II </span>focused on ‘macro-prudential regulation’. In other words, global regulators are now focusing on financial stability of the system as a whole, rather than micro regulation of any individual bank.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Banks in the West, which are market leaders for the most part, face low growth, an erosion in capital due to sovereign debt exposures and stiffer regulation. They will have to reckon with a permanent decline in their returns on equity thanks to enhanced capital requirements under the new norms. In contrast, Indian banks—and those in other emerging markets such as China and Brazil—are well-placed to maintain their returns on capital consequent to Basel III. Financial experts have opined that Basel III looks changing the economic landscape in which banking power shifts towards the emerging markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part307.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part309.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
