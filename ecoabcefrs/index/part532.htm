Eighty-six per cent of the cash in circulation thus became invalid. According to the Government, this was aimed to serve four objectives</a><span style=" color: #72C34B; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">5</span>:</p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Curbing corruption;</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Counterfeiting of currencies;</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Checking terrorism (as they use high denomination notes); and</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Preventing accumulation of black money.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part537.htm#bookmark2549" class="s58" name="bookmark2505">This action followed a series of earlier efforts to curb such illicit activities: the creation of the Special Investigative Team (SIT) in 2014, the Black Money and Imposition of Tax Act 2015, Benami Transactions Act 2016, the information exchange agreement with Switzerland, changes in the tax treaties with Mauritius, Cyprus and Singapore, and the Income Disclosure Scheme. This was not an unprecedented action as there were two previous instances of it—in 1946 and 1978, the latter</a><span style=" color: #72C34B; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">6 </span>not having any significant effect on cash.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There have been reports of job losses, declines in farm incomes, and social disruption, especially in the informal, cash-intensive parts of the economy. However, a systematic analysis is not possible yet due to paucity of data. The benefits of demonetisation can be only felt in coming years—the move was more aimed at long-term goals than short-term. We may have a <span class="s383">brief review</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">about the impact of demonetisation on the economy and behavioural aspects in the following way.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s381">Long-term benefits: </span>It is too early to quantify the direction and magnitude of long-term changes. It will take <span class="s379">several years </span>to see the impact of demonetisation on illicit transactions, on black money, and on financial savings. But there are some signs pointing to change.</p><p class="s379" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s382">(a) </span>Digitalisation: <span class="p">One intermediate objective of demonetisation is to create a </span>less-cash <span class="p">or </span>cash-lite <span class="p">economy. This will not only channelise more saving into the financial system but it will improve tax compliance also. Currently, India is far away from this objective: the </span>Watal Committee <span class="p">has recently estimated that cash accounts for about 78 per cent of all consumer payments. According to </span>Pricewaterhouse Coopers (2015) <span class="p">India has a very high predominance of consumer transactions carried out in cash relative to other countries (accounting for 68 per cent of total transactions by value and 98 per cent by volume).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">People prefer cash transaction due to many reasons. It is convenient, accepted everywhere, its use is costless for ordinary people (though not of course for society at large), is anonymous, helps preserve privacy, which is not bad till it is not illicit or designed to evade tax. Digitalisation can broadly impact the three sections of society—<span class="s379">the poor</span>, who are largely outside the digital economy; the <span class="s379">less affluent</span>, who are becoming part of the digital economy having acquired Jan-Dhan accounts and RuPay cards; and the <span class="s379">affluent</span>, who are fully digitally integrated via credit cards.</p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <i>Real estate: </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">This sector could have profound impact. In the past, much of the black money accumulated was ultimately used to evade taxes on property sales. A reduction in real estate prices is desirable as it will lead to affordable housing for the middle class, and facilitate labour mobility across India currently impeded by high and unaffordable rents.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s381">Short-term impact: </span>Demonetisation  will impose short-term costs on  the economy, which remain difficult to measure by now due to lack of the right data set. As the process has created a <span class="s379">large structural shock</span>, the underlying <span class="s379">behavioural parameters </span>of the past will be imperfect indicators of future behaviour and hence the outcomes. Although a framework of the short-term</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">impact may be outlined:</p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <i>Impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP): </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">Economic activities have been affected adversely. Thus, national income will get hit also, but it will be only temporary. The GDP might be lower by 0.25 to 0.5 per cent (coming to around 7 per cent). The implementation of GST, follow-up to demonetisation and other structural reforms should put the growth to the 8–10 per cent range that India needs.</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <i>Redistribution of income: </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">It will redistribute resources also having following effects on the fiscal accounts of the Government:</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• <span style=" color: #000F67;">RBI/Government may receive some gains from the unreturned cash</span></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—wealth gains.</p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">• <span style=" color: #000F67;">Income taxes could go up as black money was deposited in bank accounts.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Against this there are three <span class="s383">negative effects</span>. <span class="s379">First, </span>costs of printing new notes; <span class="s379">secondly, </span>costs of sterilising the surge in liquidity into the banking system (via issuance of Market Stabilisation Scheme bonds); and <span class="s379">thirdly, </span>if nominal GDP growth declines, corporate and indirect tax revenues of the centre could decline but so far there is no clear evidence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark49" class="s372" name="bookmark2506">Tapping the Prospects </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark49" class="s373">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Government needs to maximise the long-term benefits and minimise short-term costs of demonetisation. For this purpose, the following measures look beneficial:</p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Remonetisation process should be faster.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #72C34B;">(ii) </span>Any windfall revenue arising from ‘unreturned notes’ should be used for <span class="s379">capital-type expenditures </span>and not revenue ones. As this income will be one-off, its use should be one-off.</p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Digitalisation must continue in medium term, though neither it is a panacea nor cash economy is bad. Balancing benefits and costs of both forms of payments will be sensible. The transition to digitalisation must be gradual and inclusive, too. Digitalisation must be incentivised and the incentives favouring cash neutralised. The cost of incentivisation must be borne by the public sector (Government/RBI) and not the consumer or</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">financial intermediaries.</p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Efforts to collect taxes on newly disclosed (and undisclosed) wealth should not lead to tax harassment by officials at all rungs of the hierarchy. A shift is needed to greater use of data, smarter evidence- based scrutiny, more reliance on online assessments with less interactions between tax payers and tax officials. Non-punitive means should be evolved to enhance tax compliance.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #72C34B;">(v) </span>So that demonetisation indeed proves a catalyst for long-run changes in <span class="s383">behaviour</span>, it will be required to complement demonetisation with other non-punitive, incentive-compatible measures that reduce the incentives for tax evasion. Demonetisation was a potentially powerful stick that now needs <span class="s379">carrots </span>as complements. A <span class="s383">five-pronged strategy </span>could be adopted:</p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <span style=" color: #000F67;">GST should include activities that are sources of black money creation—land and other immovable property;</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Individual income tax rates and real estate stamp duties could be reduced;</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(c) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Income tax net could be widened gradually and, consistent with constitutional arrangements progressively encompass all high incomes;</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(d) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The timetable for reducing the corporate tax rate could be accelerated; and</span></p><p class="s382" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">To reduce discretion and improve accountability, tax administration needs improvement.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark150" class="s372" name="bookmark2507">Conclusion</a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark150" class="s373">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The actual cost of demonetisation will be known by the end of the fiscal 2016-17 only. While the short-term gains of it will be limited in nature, the success of this move will be mainly known by its long-term effects. However, to maximise the gains out of this, the Government needs to take several other timely and rational steps to complement it. Thus, the momentum generated should not get reduced so that economy can realise the gains from demonetisation.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part531.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part533.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
