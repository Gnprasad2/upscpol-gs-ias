The government has been implementing many such programmes for social and financial inclusion. The disbursement of benefits needs a systematic channel which will provide for financial empowerment and make monitoring easier and the local bodies more accountable. The <span class="s368">Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna (PMJDY) </span>launched in August 2014 and the <span class="s368">RuPay Card </span>(a payment solution), are important schemes in this regard. These two schemes are complementary and will enable achievement of multiple objectives such as financial inclusion, insurance penetration, and digitalisation.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">We find an increased Government emphasis <span class="s368">(Economic Survey 2016-17) </span>on the socio-economic empowerment of the <span class="s370">minorities</span>. In this regard several new schemes have been launched in recent times—the ‘Nai roshni’ scheme for leadership development of minority women; <span class="s368">Padho Pardesh</span>, a scheme of interest subsidy on educational loans for overseas studies for the students</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">belonging to the minority communities; for skill development and of the minorities, schemes like <span class="s368">Seekho Aur Kamao </span>(Learn &amp; Earn), <span class="s368">USTTAD </span>(Upgrading Skill and Training in Traditional Arts/Crafts for Development) and <span class="s368">Nai Manzil</span>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark43" class="s372" name="bookmark2438">Accessible India Campaign</a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark43" class="s373">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The number of persons with disabilities in India constituted 2.2 per cent of the population (Census 2011). It is imperative to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity <span class="s368">(UN Convention on rights of Persons with Disabilities). </span>In this direction, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD) launched <span class="s368">Accessible India Campaign </span>(Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) as a nation-wide Campaign for achieving “universal accessibility for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)” with a focus on three verticals—Built Environment, Public Transportation and ICT (Information &amp; Communication Technologies).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The Government has launched an <span class="s368">Inclusiveness and Accessibility Index </span>as part of this campaign. The index helps the industries and corporates to participate in the campaign by voluntarily evaluating their readiness for making the workplace accessible for PwDs. The index enables the organisations to introspect over their inclusive policies and organisational culture in aid of PwDs, employment of such workforce and adaptations to meet the needs of PwDs. Further, the <span class="s368">Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 </span>has been enacted by the Government aimed at securing and enhancing the rights and entitlements of PwDs (it includes the provision of increasing the reservation in government vacancies from</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3 per cent to 4 per cent).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark44" class="s372" name="bookmark2439">Strengthening the PRIs </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark44" class="s373">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments marked a watershed in the history of decentralised governance, planning, and development in India as these made panchayat bodies the third tier of government with reasonable power and authority in addition to creating space for women and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">marginalised groups in the federal set-up. Decentralised democracy was also extended to Fifth Schedule areas through the provisions of another Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act 1996 known as the Extension Act which not only made the gram sabha a strong body, but also put ‘<span class="s368">jal, jungle, and jamin</span>’ (water, forest, and land) under its control.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">These central acts, however, instead of clearly specifying the powers and functions of panchayats and municipalities, have left it to the discretion of state governments. Articles 243 G and 243 W of these acts decree that the legislature of a state may, by law, endow the panchayats/municipalities with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government. Such law may also contain provisions for devolution of powers and responsibilities upon panchayats/municipalities, subject to such conditions as may be specified therein, with respect to the preparation of plans and implementation of such schemes for economic development and social justice as may be entrusted to them. These may include inter alia <span class="s368">schemes </span>and <span class="s368">plans </span>in relation to socio-economic development and providing basic services as listed in the Eleventh and Twelfth Schedules of the Constitution.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Article 243 ZD of the 74th Amendment Act providing for constitution of district planning committees (DPC) by the state government in every district is a milestone in decentralised planning with people’s participation. These committees are expected to consolidate the plans prepared by the panchayats and municipalities in the district and prepare a draft development plan for the district as a whole. DPCs have been set up in most of the states. Much of implementation of these panchayat acts, i.e., power-sharing with panchayat bodies, is left to the states. Over the years, the panchayat bodies have not been strengthened in terms of <span class="s368">functions, finances </span>and <span class="s368">functionaries </span><span class="s370">(triple Fs) </span>with regard to preparation of plans and the listed subjects. The <span class="s368">Economic Survey 2014–15 </span>suggests the following steps towards strengthening the PRIs:</p><p class="s371" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The panchayat bodies have the potential to become true vehicles for carrying out the government’s slogan of “less government–more governance” if states show consensus.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #F67C7C;">(ii) </span>In order to convert outlays of the local-centric programmes into outcomes, these institutions need greater <span class="s368">awareness, responsibility, </span>and</p><p class="s368" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">accountability<span class="p">, which will also enable better connect of these programmes with the common man.</span></p><p class="s371" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <i>Greater devolution </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">of powers to the panchayats and municipalities is need of the hour, in respect of the ‘triple Fs’ in a phased manner.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #F67C7C;">(iv) </span>Majority of panchayat/municipality-centric programmes do have earmarked funds for awareness generation and capacity building. These funds across ministries need to be <span class="s368">pooled together </span>under the Panchayati Raj Ministry and Ministry of Urban development to make infrastructure and capacity building of panchayats and municipalities a continuous and regular process.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These <span class="s370">steps </span>will create the following possibilities in the local bodies:</p><p class="s371" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Enable them to understand not only their role and rights but also their responsibilities and will make them accountable, bringing about qualitative improvement in governance at decentralised level.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #F67C7C;">(b) </span>Transform them into <span class="s368">vibrant institutions </span>and enable them to perform their envisaged role in participatory planning, implementation, execution, monitoring, and supervision and also carry out social audit of all panchayat/municipality-centric programmes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Government has given high priority to ‘inclusion’ factor—through the ideas of “inclusive growth” (as outlined by the 11th Plan, 2007-12) and the “third generation of economic reforms” (launched 2002, on the margins of the 10th Plan, 2002-07)—it is officially decided to use the PRIs as the <span class="s368">main tool</span>. In this way, it is essential for the governments (centre and states, both) to use the untapped potential of the PRIs as the vehicle of decentralising the fruits of growth and development to the ‘grass-root’ level. For this the PRIs need strengthening—newly created ‘think tank’, the NITI can play as an instrumental role in it (through its platform, the ‘Governing Council’)—in reaching a broad consensus among the governments regarding it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part516.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part518.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
