When they get their securities released from the RBI, the value of the securities is lost by the amount of the current repo rate. The Call Money Market of India (inter-bank market) operates at this rate and banks use this route for <span class="s211">overnight </span>borrowings. This rate has direct relation with the interest rates banks charge on the loans they offer (as it affects the operational cost of the banks). The rate was 6.25 per cent in <span class="s213">March 2017</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In October 2013, RBI introduced <span class="s210">term repos </span>(of different tenors, such as, 7/14/28 days), to inject liquidity over a period that is longer than overnight. It has several purposes to serve—stronger money market, stability, and better costing and signalling of the loan products.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark56" class="s215" name="bookmark1577">Reverse Repo Rate </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark56" class="s216">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is the rate of interest the RBI pays to its clients who offer short-term loan to it.

In practice, financial instituions operating in India park their surplus funds with the RBI for short- term period and earn money. It has a direct bearing on the interest rates charged by the banks and the financial institutions on their different forms of loans.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part320.htm#bookmark1690" class="s58" name="bookmark1578">This tool was utilised by the RBI in the wake of over money supply with the Indian banks and lower loan disbursal to serve twin purposes of cutting down banks losses and the prevailing interest rate.</a><span style=" color: #21AC8E; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">15 </span>It has emerged as a very important tool in direction of following cheap interest regime—the general policy of the RBI since reform process started.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part288.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part290.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
