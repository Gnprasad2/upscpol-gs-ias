By <span class="s211">February 2017 </span>(since 2014-15), the RBI has implemented a number of schemes to facilitate resolution of the NPAs problem of the banks—briefly discussed below:</p><p class="s210" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">5/25 Refinancing: <span class="p">This scheme offered a larger window for revival of stressed assets in the infrastructure sectors and 8 core industries. Under this scheme lenders were allowed to extend the tenure of loans to 25 years with interest rates adjusted every 5 years, so tenure of the loans matches the long gestation period in the sectors. The scheme thus aimed to improve the credit</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">profile and liquidity position of borrowers, while allowing banks to treat these loans as standard in their balance sheets, reducing provisioning costs against NPAs. However, with amortisation spread out over a longer period, this arrangement also meant that the companies faced a higher interest burden, which they found difficult to repay, forcing banks to extend additional loans (called ‘evergreening’). This in turn has aggravated the initial problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s210">ARCs (Asset Reconstruction Companies): </span>ARCs were introduced to India under the SARFAESI Act (2002), as specialists to resolve the burden of NPAs. But the ARCs (most are privately-owned) finding it difficult to resolve the NPAs they purchased, are today only willing to purchase such loans at low prices. As a result, banks have been unwilling to sell them loans on a large scale. Since (2014) the fee structure of the ARCs was modified (requiring ARCs to pay a greater proportion of the purchase price <span class="s211">up-front </span>in cash to the banks) purchases of NPAs by them have slowed down further— only about 5 per cent of total NPAs were sold during 2014-15 and 2015-16.</p><p class="s210" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">SDR (Strategic Debt Restructuring): <span class="p">In June 2015, RBI came up with the SDR scheme provide an opportunity to banks to convert debt of companies (whose stressed assets were restructured but which could not finally fulfil the conditions attached to such restructuring) to 51 per cent equity and sell them to the highest bidders—ownership change takes place in it. By end-December 2016, only 2 such sales had materialized, in part because many firms remained financially unviable, since only a small portion of their debt had been converted to equity.</span></p><p class="s210" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">AQR (Asset Quality Review): <span class="p">Resolution of the problem of bad assets requires sound recognition of such assets. Therefore, the RBI emphasized AQR, to verify that banks were assessing loans in line with RBI loan classification rules. Any deviations from such rules were to be rectified by March 2016.</span></p><p class="s210" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">S4A (Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets): <span class="p">Introduced in June 2016, in it, an independent agency is hired by the banks which decides as how much of the stressed debt of a company is ‘sustainable’. The rest (‘unsustainable’) is converted into equity and preference shares. Unlike the SDR arrangement, this involves no change in the ownership of the company.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part304.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part306.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
