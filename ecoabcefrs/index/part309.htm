The regulatory requirement for CRAR is <span class="s213">9 </span>per cent for 2015. The decline in capital positions at aggregate level, however, was on account of deterioration in capital positions of PSBs. While the CRAR of the scheduled commercial banks (SCB) at 12.75 per cent as of September 2014 was satisfactory, going forward the banking sector, particularly PSBs will require substantial capital to meet regulatory requirements with respect to additional capital buffers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1639">In order to make the PSBs and RRBs compliant to the </a><span class="s211">Basel III </span><a href="part320.htm#bookmark1724" class="s58">norms,</a><span style=" color: #21AC8E; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">49</span><span class="s213"> </span>the government has been following a recapitalisation programme for them since 2011–12.

Saying simply, credit and monetary policy of an economy is all about changing the level of the money flowing in the economic system. But it can be done only when we know the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">real flow of money. That’s why it is necessary to first assess the level of money flowing in the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Following the recommendations of the <span class="s211">Second Working Group on Money Supply (SWG) </span>in 1977, RBI has been publishing four <span class="s211">monetary aggregates </span>(component of money), viz., M<span class="s89">1</span>, M<span class="s89">2</span>, M<span class="s89">3 </span>and M<span class="s89">4</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(are basically short terms for Money-1, Money-2, Money-3 and Money-4) besides the Reserve Money.

V. Reddy) which submitted its report in June 1998. The Working Group recommended compilation of four monetary aggregates on the basis of the balance sheet of the banking sector in conformity with the norms of progressive liquidity: M<span class="s89"> ⧫   </span>(monetary base), M<span class="s89">1 </span>(narrow money), M<span class="s89">2 </span>and M<span class="s89">3 </span>(broad money). In addition to the monetary aggregates, the Working Group had recommended compilation of three liquidity aggregates namely, L<span class="s89">1</span>, L<span class="s89">2  </span>and L<span class="s89">3</span>, which include select items of financial liabilities of non-depository financial corporations such as development financial institutions and non-banking financial companies accepting deposits from the public, apart from post office savings banks. The <span class="s213">New Monetary Aggregates </span>are as given below:</p><p class="s211" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;    text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1642">Reserve Money (M</a><span class="s89">0</span>) <a href="part320.htm#bookmark1726" class="s58">= Currency in circulation + Bankers’ Deposits with the RBI + ‘Other’</a><span style=" color: #21AC8E; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">51</span><b> </b><span class="p">deposits with the RBI.</span></p><p class="s211" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Narrow Money (M<span class="s89">1</span>) <span class="p">= Currency with the Public + Demand Deposits with</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;    text-align: justify;">the Banking System + ‘Other’ deposits with the RBI.

The new broad money aggregate (referred to as <span class="s213">NM</span><span class="s89">3 </span>for the purpose of clarity) in the Monetary Survey would comprise, in addition to NM<span class="s89">2</span>, long-term deposits of residents as well as call/term borrowings from non-bank sources, which have emerged as an important source of resource mobilisation for banks. The critical <span class="s211">difference </span>between  M<span class="s89">3 </span>and  NM<span class="s89">3 </span>is the treatment of non-resident repatriable fixed foreign currency liabilities of the banking system in the money supply compilation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There are <span class="s213">two basic changes </span>in the new monetary aggregates. <span class="s211">First, </span>since the post office bank is not a part of the banking sector, <span class="s210">postal deposits </span>are no longer treated as part of money supply, as was the case in the extant M<span class="s89">2 </span>and M<span class="s89">4</span>. <span class="s211">Second, </span>the residency criterion was adopted to a limited extent for compilation of monetary aggregates. The Working Group made a recommendation in favour of compilation of monetary aggregates on residency basis. Residency essentially relates to the country in which the holder has a centre of economic interest. Holdings of currency and deposits by the non-residents in the rest of the world sector, would be determined by their portfolio choice. However, these transactions form part of balance of payments (BoP). Such holdings of currency and deposits are not strictly related to the domestic demand for monetary assets. It is therefore argued that these transactions should be regarded as external liabilities to be netted from foreign currency assets of the banking system. However, in the context of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">developing countries such as India, which have a large number of expatriate workers who remit their savings in the form of deposits, it could be argued that these non-residents have a centre of economic interest in their country of origin. Although in a macro-economic accounting framework all non-resident deposits need to be separated from domestic deposits and treated as capital flows, the underlying economic reality may point otherwise. In the Indian context, it may not be appropriate to exclude all categories of non-resident deposits from domestic monetary aggregates as non-resident rupee deposits are essentially integrated into the domestic financial system. The new monetary aggregates, therefore, exclude only non-resident repatriable foreign currency fixed deposits from deposit liabilities and treat those as external liabilities. Accordingly, from among the various categories of non-resident deposits at present, only Foreign Currency Non-Resident Accounts (Banks) [FCNR(B)] deposits are classified as external liabilities and excluded from the domestic money stock. Since the bulk of the FCNR(B) deposits are held abroad by commercial banks, the monetary impact of changes in such deposits is captured through changes in net foreign exchange assets of the commercial banks. Thus, now the new monetary aggregates NM<span class="s89">2 </span>and NM<span class="s89">3 </span>as well as liquidity aggregates L<span class="s89">1</span>, L<span class="s89">2</span>, and L3 have been introduced, the components of which are elaborated as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">NM<span class="s89">1 </span>= Currency with the Public + Demand Deposits with the Banking System + ‘Other’ Deposits with the RBI.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">NM<span class="s89">2 </span>= NM<span class="s89">1 </span>+ Short Term Time Deposits of Residents (including the contractual maturity of one year).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">NM<span class="s89">3 </span>= NM<span class="s89">2 </span>+ Long-term Time Deposits of Residents + Call/Term Funding from Financial Institutions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">L<span class="s89">1 </span>= NM<span class="s89">3 </span>+ All Deposits with the Post Office Savings Banks (excluding National Savings Certificates)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">L<span class="s89">2 </span>= L<span class="s89">1 </span>+ Term deposits with Term Lending Institutions and Refinancing Institutions (FIs) + Term Borrowing by FIs + Certificates of Deposit issued by FIs</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">L<span class="s89">3 </span>= L<span class="s89">2 </span>+ Public Deposits of Non-Banking Financial Companies.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Data on M<span class="s89"> ⧫   </span>are published by the RBI on <span class="s211">weekly </span>basis, while those for M<span class="s89">1</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and M<span class="s89">3</span><span class="s162"> </span>are available on <span class="s211">fortnightly </span>basis.

But in banking and typical monetary management terminology the level and supply of M<span class="s89">3 </span>is known as money supply. The growth rate of broad money (M<span class="s89">3</span>), i.e., <span class="s211">money supply</span>, was not only lower than the indicative growth set by the Reserve Bank of India, but it also witnessed continuous and sequential deceleration in the last 7 quarters and moderated to 11.2 per cent by December 2012. Aggregate deposits with the banks were the major component of broad money counting for over 85 per cent remaining almost stable. The sources of broad money are net bank credit to the government and to the commercial sector. These two together accounted for nearly 100 per cent of the broad money in 2012–13, compared</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to 89 per cent in 2009–10.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark61" class="s215" name="bookmark1647">High Power Money</a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark61" class="s216">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The central banks of all the countries are empowered to issue the currency. The currency issued by the central bank is called ‘high power money’ because it is generally backed by supporting ‘reserves’ and its value is guaranteed by the government and it is the source of all other forms of money. The currency issued by the central bank is, in fact, is a liability of the central bank and the government. In general, therefore, this liability must be backed by an equal value of assets consisting mainly, gold and foreign exchange reserves. In practice, however, most countries<span class="s89"># </span>have adopted a ‘minimum reserve system’.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Under the <span class="s211">minimum reserve system </span>the central bank is required to keep a certain minimum ‘reserve of gold and foreign securities and is empowered to <span class="s210">issue currency to any extent</span>. India adopted this system in October 1956. The RBI was required to hold a reserve worth of only</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rs 515 crore consisting of foreign securities worth Rs 400 crore and gold worth Rs 115 crore. In 1957, however, the minimum reserves were further reduced to only gold reserve of Rs 115 crore and the rest in the form of rupee securities, mainly due to the scarcity of foreign exchange to meet essential import bill. A gold reserve of Rs. 115 crore against the currency of Rs. 17,00,000 crore in circulation today, makes only 0.7 per cent reserve which is of no consequence. This makes the Indian currency system a ‘managed paper currency system’. In India, there are two sources of <span class="s211">high power money </span>supply:</p><p class="s214" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">RBI; and</span></p><p class="s214" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Government of India.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The RBI issues currency notes of rupees 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 2000 denominations which RBI calls as the ‘Reserve Money’.
