In this process two kinds of FIs came up:</p><p class="s203" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <i>State Finance Corporations (SFCs): </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">First came up in Punjab (1955) with other states following its example. There are 18 SFCs working presently.</span></p><p class="s203" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <i>State Industrial Development Corporations (SIDCs): </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">A fully dedicated state public sector FI to the cause of industrial development in the concerned states. First such FIs were set up (1960) in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Almost all of the SFCs and SIDCs are at present running in huge losses. They may be re-structured on the lines of the AIFIs, but there is lack of will from the states and private financiers who are not interested to go in for their takeovers as such.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark34" class="s191" name="bookmark1515">2.

Presently, the industry consists of commercial banks both in public and private sectors, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and co-operative banks—a total of 171 Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) out of whch 113 are in the public sector (19 nationalised banks, 7 banks in SBI group, one IDBI Bank Ltd. and 86 RRBs); with the rest of the 58 banks owned by the private sector (domestic and foreign—FDI in banks is allowed upto 26 per cent).</a><a href="part283.htm#bookmark1549" class="s201">21</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In the wake of the economic reforms the government has promised speedier expansion of the banking sector.

Since then many private players have entered the industry. Presently, Indian insurance industry consists of one public sector life insurer (LIC) and four public sector general insurers; two specialised public sector insurers (AICIL and ECGC); one public sector re-insurer (GIC) and 37 private insurance companies (in collaboration with established foreign insurers from across the world).</a><a href="part283.htm#bookmark1550" style=" color: #D1232A; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 130%;  vertical-align: 5pt;">®</a><span class="s202">22 </span>The expansion and penetration insurance in the country have increased during the reform period, but not as per the expectations of the governments and the experts—several reasons have been responsible for this (for a detailed discussion on the insurance industry refer <span class="s200">Chapter 13</span>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark36" class="s191" name="bookmark1519">4.
