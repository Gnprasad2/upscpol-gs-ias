Infrastructural Needs</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Every economy whether it is agrarian, industrial or post-industrial, needs suitable levels of infrastructure such as power, transportation and communication. Without their healthy presence and expansion, no economy can grow and develop.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">At the eve of Independence, India was having almost no presence of these three basic requirements. There was just a beginning in the area of railways, and post and telegraph. Power was restricted to selective homes of government and the princely states. [It means, even if India had opted for agriculture as its prime moving force, it had to develop the infrastructure</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sector.]</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">These sectors require too much capital investment as well as heavy enginering and technological support for their development. Expansion of the infrastructure sector was considered not possible by the private sector of the time as they could possibly not manage the following components:</p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">heavy investment (in domestic as well as foreign currencies),</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">technology,</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">skilled manpower, and</span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">entrepreneurship.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;">Even if these inputs were available to the private sector, it was not feasible for them as there was no market for such infrastructure. These</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">infrastructures were essential for the economy, but they needed either subsidised or almost free supply as the masses lacked the market-determined purchasing capacity. Under these typical condition, it was only the government which could have shouldered the responsibility. The</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">government could have managed not only the inputs required for the development of the sector, but could also supply and distribute them to the needy areas and the consumers for the proper growth of the economy. There were no alternatives and that is why the infrastructure sector in India has such a dominant state presence that many areas have obvious government monopoliesâ€”as in power, railways, aviation, telecommnication, etc.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part37.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part39.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
