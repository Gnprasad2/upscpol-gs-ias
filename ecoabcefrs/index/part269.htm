Domestic regulations, in strict WTO terms, include licensing requirements, licensing procedures, qualification requirements, qualification procedures, and technical standards but here other restrictions and barriers are also considered. While there are many domestic regulations in our major markets, which deny market access to us and therefore need to be negotiated at multilateral and bilateral levels, there are also many domestic regulations in India which hinder the growth of this sector.</p><p class="s189" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part272.htm#bookmark1481" class="s58" name="bookmark1460">Since domestic regulations perform the role of tariffs in regulating services, there is need to list the domestic regulations in India which need to be curbed to help growth of the sector and its exports, while retaining those which are necessary for regulating the sector at this stage. An indicative list of some important domestic regulations in India which need to be examined for suitable policy reforms</a><span style=" color: #E8521F; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">9</span> <span class="p">in the services sector is as follows:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 17pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark48" class="s191" name="bookmark1461">Trade and Transport Services</a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark48" class="s192">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some constraints in these sectors include restrictions on inter-state movement of goods which could ease with the adoption of the model <span class="s190">Agriculture Produce and Marketing Committee (APMC) Act </span>by many states; the <span class="s190">Multimodal Transportation of Goods Act 1993 </span>which needs revision to ease the existing restrictions on transportation and documentation through different modes of transport, particularly restrictions in the <span class="s190">Customs Act</span>, which do not allow seamless movement of goods; and restrictions on free movement of cargo between <span class="s190">Inland Container Depots (ICDs), Container Freight Stations (CFSs) </span>and <span class="s190">Ports</span>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark49" class="s191" name="bookmark1462">Construction Development</a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark49" class="s192">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">In this sector, bottlenecks result from continuation of restrictions under the</p><p class="s190" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act (ULCRA) <span class="p">in some states namely</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, and West Bengal, which have not yet repealed it and the confusion in the process required for clearance of buildings even after the repeal of ULCRA by passing of the Urban Land(Ceiling and Regulations) Repeal Act 1999 by the other states.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There is also lack of clarity on the role of states as facilitators in the <span class="s190">land acquisition </span>policy resulting in increasing number of court litigations adding to risk profile of builders/projects thereby restricting lenders from extending finance to such builders/ projects.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There are also restrictions on floor area ratio (FAR) in many states; and other restrictions like the application of bye laws/regulations and its exemptions, e.g., increase in FAR which varies from project to project and is sometimes discriminatory. Obtaining environment clearance is another major hindrance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark150" class="s191" name="bookmark1463">Accountancy Services</a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark150" class="s192">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While the accountancy professionals were hitherto allowed to operate either as a partnership firm or as a sole proprietorship firm or in their own name since the Indian regulations do not permit exceeding 20 professionals under one firm, the emergence of <span class="s190">Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) </span>structure is likely to address this impediment. However, the number of statutory audits of companies per partner is restricted to 20.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">FDI is also not allowed in this sector and foreign service providers are not allowed to undertake statutory audit of companies as per the provisions of the laws in India. There are also domestic regulations like prohibition on the use of individual <span class="s190">logos </span>for partnership and single proprietorship accounting firms. These regulations need to be relaxed and streamlined to facilitate tie- ups and penetrate foreign markets given the potential for exporting these services by the outsourcing mode.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark151" class="s191" name="bookmark1464">Legal Services</a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark151" class="s192">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In this sector, FDI is not permitted and international law firms are not authorised to advertise and open offices in India.

The <span class="s190">Bar Council </span>is opposed to entry of foreign lawyers/law firms in any manner.
