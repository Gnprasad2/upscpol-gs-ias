Insurance penetration is defined as the ratio of premium underwritten in a given year to the gross domestic product (GDP). Likewise, insurance density is another well recognised benchmark and is defined as the ratio of premium underwritten in a given year to total population (measured in US dollars for convenience of comparison). The Indian insurance business has in the past remained under-developed with low levels of insurance penetration.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part335.htm#bookmark1792" class="s58" name="bookmark1768">At present</a><span style=" color: #CC932B; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">20</span>, <span class="s227">insurance penetration </span>in India is <span class="s228">3.3 </span>per cent of the GDP (it was 2.71 per cent in 2001) while the <span class="s227">insurance density </span>is at US$55 (it was US$11.5 in 2001).

It had set up a National Health Insurance Working Group in 2003, which provided a platform for the various stakeholders in the health insurance industry to work together and suggest solutions on various relevant issues in the sector. The IRDA is also co-ordinating with and supporting insurance industry initiatives in standardising certain key terminology used in health insurance documents, for better comprehension and in the interest of policyholders. The <span class="s226">General Insurance Council, </span>comprising all non-life insurers, evolved a consensus on a uniform definition of ‘pre-existing diseases’ and its exclusion wording, which has earlier been an expression with many definitions, still more interpretations, and certainly a whole lot of grievances. Such standardisation, effective 1 June, 2008 will help the insured by minimising ambiguity and also by better comparability of health insurance products. Also, with effect from 1 October, 2011, portability in health insurance has been started in which an insured, if not happy with services or the product of the existing insurer, can change to another insurer whilst enjoying the benefits (especially that of pre- existing diseases) of her/his existing policy.</p><p class="s231" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <b>Micro Insurance: </b><span style=" color: #000F67;">Micro insurance regulations issued by the IRDA have provided a fillip to propagating micro insurance as a conceptual issue. With the positive and facilitative approach adopted under the micro insurance regulations, it is expected that all insurance companies would come out with a progressive business approach and carry forward the spirit of regulations thereby extending insurance penetration to all segments of the society. Presently, there are 10,482 micro–insurance agents operating in the micro–insurance sector.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part332.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part334.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
