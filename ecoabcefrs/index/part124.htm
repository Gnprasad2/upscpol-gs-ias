As the governments have authority of printing currency and circulating it into the economy (as they do in the case of deficit financing), this act functions as an income to the governments. This is a situation of sustaining government expenditure at the cost of people’s income. This looks as if inflation is working as a tax.</a><span style=" color: #E89EC1; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">23 </span>That is how the term inflation tax is also known as <span class="s80">seigniorage</span>.

Basically, due to inflation the profit of firms/companies gets overstated. When a firm</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">calculates its profits after adjusting the effects of current level of inflation, this process is known as inflation accounting.

The interest banks charge on their lending is known as the <span class="s80">nominal </span>interest rate, which might not be the real cost of borrowing paid by the borrower to the banks. To calculate the real cost a borrower is paying on its loan, the nominal rate of interest is adjusted with the effect of inflation and thus the interest rate we get is known as the real interest rate. Real interest is always lower than the nominal interest rate, if the inflation is taking place— the difference is the inflation premium.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part158.htm#bookmark941" class="s58" name="bookmark822">Rising inflation premium shows depleting profits of the lending institutions.

Since then the RBI has been following a tighter credit policy as inflation was going beyond the upper limit of its healthy range (i.e., 4–5 per cent in the Indian case).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark61" class="s82" name="bookmark823">Phillips Curve </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark61" class="s83">                                     </a></p><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part158.htm#bookmark942" class="s58" name="bookmark824">It is a graphic curve which advocates a relationship between inflation and unemployment in an economy. As per the curve there is a ‘trade off’ between inflation and unemployment, i.e., an inverse relationship between them. The curve suggests that lower the inflation, higher the unemployment and higher the inflation, lower the unemployment.</a><span style=" color: #E89EC1; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">28</span> <span class="p">During the 1960s, this idea was among the most important theories of the modern economists.

The central banks of the developed world started framing the required kind of monetary policies mixing the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The idea became popular among the developing economies too by the late 1960s, though they were a bit confused, as most of them were fighting the menace of higher inflations (double digit) along with high level of unemployment.</a><a href="part158.htm#bookmark944" class="s78">30</a></p><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark827"><span class="p">By the early 1970s, two American economists, Milton Friedman (Nobel Laureate, 1976) and Edmund Phelps challenged the idea of the Phillips Curve. According to them the trade-off between inflation and unemployment was only short-term, because once people came to expect higher inflation they started demanding higher wages and thus unemployment will rise back to its ‘</span></a><i>natural rate</i><a href="part158.htm#bookmark945" class="s58">’ (the unemployment rate that occurs at full employment when the economy is producing at potential output, it is usually called the natural rate of unemployment).</a><span style=" color: #E89EC1; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">31</span> <span class="p">They advocated that there was no long- term trade-off between inflation and unemployment. In the long run, monetary policy can influence inflation. They suggested that if monetary policy tried to hold unemployment below its natural rate, inflation will be rising to higher level, which is also known as the </span>non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)<a href="part158.htm#bookmark946" class="s58">.</a><span style=" color: #E89EC1; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">32</span> <span class="p">The NAIRU is that rate of unemployment which is consistent with a constant rate of inflation. It means at NAIRU, the upward and downward forces on price (inflation) and wage (unemployment) neutralise each other and there is no tendency of change in the rate of inflation. We may say that the NAIRU is the lowest unemployment rate that an economy can sustain without any upward pressure on inflation rate.</span><a name="bookmark828">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark62" class="s82" name="bookmark829">Reflation </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark62" class="s83">                                     </a></p><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part158.htm#bookmark947" class="s58" name="bookmark830">Reflation is a situation often deliberately brought by the government to reduce unemployment and increase demand by going for higher levels of economic growth.</a><span style=" color: #E89EC1; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">33</span>  <span class="p">Governments go  for higher public expenditures,  tax cuts,  interest rate cuts,  etc.  Fiscal deficit rises,  extra money  is generally printed at higher level of growth, wages increase and there is almost no improvement in unemployment.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Reflation can also be understood from a different angle—when the economy is crossing a cycle of recession (low inflation, high unemployment, low demand, etc.) and government takes some economic policy decisions to revive the economy from recession, certain goods see sudden and temporary increase in their prices, such price rise is also known as reflation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark63" class="s82" name="bookmark831">Stagflation</a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark63" class="s83">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part158.htm#bookmark948" class="s58" name="bookmark832">Stagflation is a situation in an economy when inflation and unemployment both are at higher levels, contrary to conventional belief.

This took place as a result of oil price increases of 1973 and 1979 and anticipation of higher inflation. The stagflationary situation continued till the early 1980s. Conventional thinking that a trade-off existed between inflation and unemployment (i.e., Phillips Curve) was falsified and several economies switched over to alternative ways of economic policies, such as monetaristic and supply-side economics.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part158.htm#bookmark949" class="s58" name="bookmark833">When the economy is passing through the cycle of stagnation (i.e., long period of low aggregate demand in relation to its productive capacity) and the government shuffles with the economic policy, a sudden and temporary price rise is seen in some of the goods—such inflation is also known as stagflation.
