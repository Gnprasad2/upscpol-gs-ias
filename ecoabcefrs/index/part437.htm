This was the first such meeting to be hosted by an African nation. The outcomes of the Conference, referred to as the </a><span class="s309">Nairobi Package</span><a href="part439.htm#bookmark2070" class="s58">, are as given below</a><span style=" color: #E1775D; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">20</span>:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(i) </span>The Nairobi Declaration reflects divergence amongst the WTO membership on the relevance of reaffirming the <span class="s313">Doha Development Agenda (DDA) </span>as the basis of future negotiations. This was despite the fact that India, along with many other developing countries, from groups such as the G-33, LDCs, and the Africa Group, wanted a reaffirmation of the mandate of the Doha Round. While reflecting that there are divergences, the Ministerial Declaration also notes the “strong commitment of all Members to advance negotiations on the remaining Doha issues”. It records that WTO work would maintain development at</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">its centre. It also reaffirms that provisions for special and differential treatment shall remain integral.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(ii) </span>As the future of the Doha Round appeared in doubt, India sought and succeeded in obtaining a re-affirmative Ministerial Decision on <span class="s313">Public Stockholding for Food Security Purposes </span>honouring both the <span class="s309">Bali </span>Ministerial and General Council Decisions. The decision commits members to engage constructively in finding a <span class="s309">permanent solution </span>to this issue.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(iii) </span>A large group of developing countries has long been seeking an SSM (Special Safeguard Mechanism) for <span class="s313">agricultural products</span>. In order to ensure that this issue remains on the agenda of future discussion in the WTO, India negotiated a Ministerial Decision which recognizes that developing countries will have the right to have recourse to an SSM as envisaged in the mandate. Members will continue to negotiate the mechanism in dedicated sessions of the Committee on Agriculture in Special Session.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(iv) </span>It was also agreed to the elimination of <span class="s313">agricultural export subsidies </span>subject to the preservation of special and differential treatment for developing countries such as a longer phase-out period for transportation and marketing export subsidies for exporting agricultural products. Developed countries have committed to removing export subsidies immediately, except for a few agricultural products, and developing countries will do so by 2018.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(v) </span>Developing countries will keep the flexibility to cover <span class="s313">marketing and transport subsidies </span>for agriculture exports until the end of 2023, and the LDCs and net food-importing developing countries would have additional time to cut such export subsidies. The Ministerial Decision contains disciplines to ensure that other export policies are not used as a disguised form of subsidies. These disciplines include—</p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <span style=" color: #000F67;">terms to limit the benefits of financing support to agriculture exporters;</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <span style=" color: #000F67;">rules on state enterprises engaging in agriculture trade; and</span></p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(c) <span style=" color: #000F67;">disciplines to ensure that food aid does not negatively affect domestic production.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(vi) </span>One of the Decisions adopted extends the relevant provision to prevent <span class="s313">‘ever-greening’ </span>of patents in the pharmaceuticals sector. This decision would help in maintaining an affordable and accessible supply of <span class="s313">generic medicines</span>.</p><p class="s312" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(vii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">India supported  outcomes on  issues of interest to  LDCs including enhanced preferential rules of origin for LDCs and preferential treatment for LDC services providers. India already offers duty-free, quota-free access scheme to all LDCs, which provides a comprehensive coverage with simple, transparent and liberal rules of origin. India has also recently (late 2015) made available substantial and commercially meaningful preferences in services to LDCs.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(viii) </span>The issue of <span class="s309">fisheries </span>subsidies could not be resolved due to lack of consensus. Including India, several other countries (China, Egypt, South Africa, Korea and Saudi Arabia, etc) were opposed to disciplining rules on fisheries subsidies due to the lack of clarity.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(ix) </span>On the issue of <span class="s313">Anti-dumping</span>, India strongly opposed a proposal that would give greater power to the WTO’s Anti-Dumping Committee to review Members’ practices. Due to lack of convergence, no outcome was achieved.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(x) </span>A group of 53 WTO members, including both developed and developing countries, agreed on the timetable for implementing a deal to <span class="s313">eliminate tariffs </span>on 201 Information Technology products. This duty-free market will be available to all WTO members (even to India, which was not party to the agreement).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E1775D;">(xi) </span>As regards the introduction of other <span class="s309">new issues </span>for discussion, the Declaration acknowledges the differences in views and states that any decision to launch negotiations multilaterally on such issues would need to be agreed by all Members. The rich (developed) countries wanted the introduction of new issues of their interests which included—<i>global value chain</i>, <span class="s313">e-commerce, competition laws, labour, environment </span>and <span class="s313">investments.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part436.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part438.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
