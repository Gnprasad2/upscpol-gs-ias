Alongwith this, transactions in commodity derivatives have been declared to be made <span class="s325">non-speculative</span>; and hence for traders in the commodity derivative segment, any losses arising from such transactions can be set off against income from any other source (similar provisions are also applicable for the securities market transactions).</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Like all financial transaction taxes, CTT <span class="s321">aims </span>at discouraging excessive speculation, which is detrimental to the market and to bring parity between securities market and commodities market such that there is no tax/regulatory arbitrage. <span class="s325">Futures contracts </span>are financial instruments and provide for price risk management and price discovery of the underlying asset commodity / currency / stocks / interest. It is, therefore, essential that the policy framework governing them is uniform across all the contracts irrespective of the underlying assets to minimise the chances of regulatory arbitrage. The proposal of CTT also appears to have stemmed from the general policy of the government to widen the tax base.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Commodities Transaction Tax (CTT) is a tax similar to Securities Transaction Tax (STT), proposed to be levied in India, on transactions done on the domestic commodity derivatives exchanges. Globally, commodity derivatives are also considered as financial contracts. Hence CTT can also be considered as a type of ‘financial transaction tax’.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The concept of CTT was <span class="s321">first </span>introduced in the <span class="s325">Union Budget 2008–09</span>. The government had then proposed to impose a commodities transaction tax (CTT) of 0.017 per cent (equivalent to the rate of equity futures at that point</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of time). However, it was withdrawn subsequently as the market was <span class="s325">nascent </span>then and any imposition of transaction tax might have adversely affected the growth of organised commodities derivatives markets in India. This has helped Indian commodity exchanges to grow to global standards [MCX is the world’s <span class="s321">No. 3 </span>commodity exchange; globally, MCX is <span class="s321">No. 1 </span>in gold and silver, <span class="s321">No. 2 </span>in natural gas and <span class="s321">No. 3 </span>in crude oil].</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part449.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part451.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
