Many fresh proposals suggesting immediacy of planning in India were put forward, though the erstwhile British government remained almost immune to them. But these humble proposals of planning served their purpose once India became independent and decided to adopt a planned economy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark23" class="h3" name="bookmark390">The Visvesvaraya Plan </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark23" class="s52">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The credit of proposing the first blueprint of Indian planning is given to the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark391">popular civil engineer and the ex-Dewan of the Mysore state, M.

Its President N.R. Sarkar proclaimed that the days of undiluted laissez-faire were gone forever and for a backward country like India, a comprehensive plan for economic development covering the whole gamut of economic activities was a necessity. Voicing the views of the capitalist class, he further called for a high powered ‘National Planning Commission’ to coordinate the whole process of planning so that the country could make a structural break with the past and achieve its full growth potential.</a><a href="part92.htm#bookmark577" class="s50">7</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">By the late nineteenth century, the economic thinking of the nationalists (such as M.G. Ranade and Dadabhai Naroji) was in favour of a dominant role of the state in the economy and doubted the prudence of the ‘market mechanism’. This thinking was further reinforced by the Keynesian ideas in the wake of the Great Depression, the <span class="s22">New Deal </span>in the USA and the Soviet experiment in national planning. Thus, the Indian capitalist class were also influenced by these events which were voiced in the FICCI articulation for planning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark25" class="h3" name="bookmark394">The Congress Plan </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark25" class="s52">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part92.htm#bookmark578" class="s58" name="bookmark395">Though the Gandhians and some of the business and propertied representatives were opposed to commit the party to centralised state planning (including Mahatma Gandhi),</a><span style=" color: #62BAD4; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">8 </span><a href="part92.htm#bookmark579" class="s58">it was on the initiative</a><span style=" color: #62BAD4; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">9 </span>of the INC<a name="bookmark396">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part92.htm#bookmark580" class="s58" name="bookmark397">president Subhash C.

The plan laid more emphasis on agriculture. Even if he referred to industrialisation, it was to the level of promoting cottage and village-level industries, unlike the NPC and the Bombay Plan which supported a leading role for the heavy and large industries. The plan articulated a ‘decentralised economic structure’ for India with ‘self-contained villages’.</p><p class="s51" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part92.htm#bookmark592" class="s58" name="bookmark411">It needs to be noted here that the Gandhians did not agree with the views of the NPC or the Bombay Plan, particularly on issues like centralised planning, dominant role of the state in the economy and the emphasis on industrialisation being the major ones.</a><span style=" color: #62BAD4; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">22</span> <span class="p">For Gandhi, the machinery, commercialisation and centralised state power were the curses of modern civilisation, thrust upon the Indian people by European colonialism.

This was until the 1940s that the Congress supported the above-given view of Gandhi to mobilise a mass movement against the colonial rule. But it was in the NPC that the Congress tried to articulate a different view on these issues, almost taking a break from Gandhi’s ideas. The very first session of the NPC was brought to an impasse by J.C. Kumarappa (the lone Gandhian on the 15-member NPC) by questioning the authority of the NPC to discuss plans for industrialisation. He said on the occassion that the national priority as adopted by the Congress was to restrict and eliminate modern industrialism. The impasse was normalised after Nehru intervened and declared that most members of the NPC felt that large-scale industry ought to be promoted as long as it did not ‘come into conflict with the cottage industries’.</a><span style=" color: #62BAD4; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">23</span> <span class="p">This was a long-drawn ideological impasse which made it necessary to articulate the Gandhian view of planning via this plan.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark28" class="h3" name="bookmark413">The People’s Plan </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark28" class="s52">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part92.htm#bookmark594" class="s58" name="bookmark414">In 1945, yet another plan was formulated by the radical humanist leader M.N.

Many economists have attributed the socialist leanings in Indian planning to this plan.

The plan drew its major inspirations from the Gandhian techniques of constructive works by the community and trusteeship as well as the Sarvodaya concept of Acharya Vinoba Bave, the eminent Gandhian constructive worker. Major ideas of the plan were highly similar to the Gandhian Plan like emphasis on agriculture, agri-based small and cottage industries, self-reliance and almost no dependence on foreign capital and technology, land reforms, self-dependent villages and decentralised participatory form of planning and economic progress, to name the major ones.</a><span style=" color: #62BAD4; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">25 </span>Some of the acceptable ideas of the plan got their due importance when the Government of India promoted five year plans.</p><p class="s51" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part92.htm#bookmark596" class="s58" name="bookmark417">By the early 1960s, Jayaprakash Narayan had become highly critical of the Indian planning process, especially of its increasing centralising nature and dilution of people’s participation in it.

The committee pointed out that after having accepted Panchayati Raj as the agency responsible for planning and execution of plans, there is “no longer any valid reason for continuing the individual allocations subjectwise even to serve as a guide.”</a><a href="part92.htm#bookmark597" class="s50">27</a><a name="bookmark418">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Disregarding the humble advice of the committee, central schemes like small farmers development agency (SFDA), drought-prone area programme (DPAP), intensive tribal development programme (ITDP), intensive agricultural district programme (IADP), etc., were introduced by the government and were put totally outside the purview of the Panchayats.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">It was only after the 73rd and 74th Amendments effected to the Constitution (1992) that the role of local bodies and their importance in the process of planned development was accepted and the views of Jayprakash got vindicated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark30" class="h3" name="bookmark419">Some Area-wise Reports </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark30" class="s52">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The idea for the need of a planned development of India became more and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part92.htm#bookmark598" class="s58" name="bookmark420">more popular by the decade of the 1940s.

In this, state-owned and state-managed enterprises have an important role to play.

When they were prepared, it was known that transfer of power was to take place quite soon; but the exact form of the future government was not known, the plans consisted largely of proposals of experts, which were not effectively co-ordinated. They had no social philosophy behind them. With the advent of Independence, they became inadequate, though the thinking that had taken place on planning generally and its techniques proved useful for the future.”</a><a href="part92.htm#bookmark600" class="s50">30</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part51.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part53.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
