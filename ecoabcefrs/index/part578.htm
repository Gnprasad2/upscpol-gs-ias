Monetary policy is an instrument in this respect. However, the right policies may not be palatable to the political and fiscal authorities, which is a serious problem for the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">From May beginning to end of September is the <span class="s388">slack season </span>and from October beginning to end-April is the <span class="s388">busy season </span>of the <span class="s391">Indian Economy</span>. During the slack season, crops are generally sown. Agriculture and related businesses are slack and loans taken during the previous busy season tend to be returned. Consequently, the growth rate of money is low or negative. Governments usually borrow heavily during the slack season, since the demand for credit from the commercial sector is not very strong. Since there are no fresh crop arrivals in the market and the demand for crops is steady, the prices are expected to be generally upward in the slack season.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">From October, the busy season commences and both agricultural and related industrial productions are high. Since crops arrive in the market during the busy season, prices generally are on the downward drift. It is the seasonal variation in the arrival of crops in the market, in the context of steady demand, that causes prices to fluctuate during the year.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The above pattern has been severely modified in recent years. The government borrows both during the slack and the busy seasons. Industry too is active in both the seasons. Because of greater storage and stocking facilities, the variations in the flows of agricultural products have been reduced. Money supply expands continuously and prices are generally up throughout.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part577.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part579.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
