Politicisation of the Planning Process</h3></a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a democratic political system, almost every issue of socio-political importance is influenced by politics. It is more correct in the case of lesser matured democracies. The same stands true for the process of planning in our country. Greater and greater politicisation of the planning process culminated in such a design that at times economic planning served the opposite purpose. For example, we know that planning is a tool for promoting regionally balanced growth, but in India in the process of serving vested political interests of the Centre, it resulted into promoting an imbalanced growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In recent years, the government has tried to address the major criticism of planning in India. More such constructive steps with better results are expected in future. More aware and better informed citizens will lead to better and better planning in future.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There has been a general anger among the sections of society regarding coalition politics, scams, etc., in recent years. The <span class="s24">Economic Survey 2014–15 </span>rightly <span class="s22">blames coalition politics </span>and the <span class="s22">federal structure </span>for tardy decision making in several areas—from oil subsidy to tax reforms, FDI in retail and free movement of foodgrains. Almost everyone outside the government blamed it for <span class="s22">policy paralysis</span>. The Survey notes it as an area of concern. The Survey notes that <span class="s24">politicians </span>and <span class="s24">policymakers </span>can set the ball rolling by acting as <span class="s24">role models, </span>but it also cited the poor record on enforcement of contract to argue that people’s attitude needs to change. <span class="s22">“In these everyday situations (such as hiring a cab or a painter) it is cumbersome to bring in the state and the law courts. Here the main guarantor has to be people’s personal integrity and trustworthiness” , </span>it says. The statement comes from a government that has been battling a spate of <span class="s22">corruption scandals</span>—ranging</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part92.htm#bookmark674" class="s58" name="bookmark541">from those in the telecom sector to Commonwealth Games and criticism over poor governance standards and inability to push through critical decisions.</a><a href="part92.htm#bookmark674" class="s50">104</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark542">The </a><span class="s24">Economic Survey 2012–13 </span>suggested a new objective for the Planning Commission—the global economic and financial crisis which has persisted for the last five years has not only exposed the vulnerability of almost all the countries over the globe to external shocks, but also has lessons for the <span class="s24">planning process</span><a href="part92.htm#bookmark675" class="s58">, viz., countries need to have inbuilt social safety nets for facing such eventualities, which affect the weak and vulnerable the most, and wipe out the fruits of growth for years.
