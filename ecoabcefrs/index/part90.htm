The evaluation set up was further strengthened by the development of methods and techniques of evaluation in the 1st Plan and setting up of evaluation machineries in the States during the 3rd (1961–66) and 4th (1969–74) Plans. Gradually, with the extension of the programmes/schemes in a variety of sectors, viz., agricultural cooperation, rural industries, fisheries, health, family welfare, rural development, rural electrification, public distribution, tribal development, social forestry, etc., the evaluation work undertaken by the PEO was extended to other important CSSs.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The broad <span class="s51">functions </span>of the PEO include undertaking evaluation of selected programmes/schemes under implementation, as per the requirement of the various Divisions of the PC, Central Ministries and Departments of the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Government of India.

It has a <span class="s51">three-tier </span>structure:</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">First Tier: <span class="p">At the apex is the Headquarters at the PC, which is responsible for evolving suitable methodologies, including statistical designs for various type of evaluation studies, organising execution and monitoring of sample surveys, data processing, statistical analysis and interpretation of qualitative and quantitative data generated by the field units and also for bringing out the Evaluation Reports. The organisation is headed by the Adviser (Evaluation).</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Second Tier: <span class="p">The middle link of the PEO represents Regional Evaluation Offices, which are 7 in number located at Chandigarh, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tird Tier: <span class="p">The Field Units, known as Project Evaluation Offices constitute the third tier of PEO. These are located in the capital cities of 8 major states of the country, viz., Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Shimla, Bangalore, Bhopal, Patna, Thrivananthapuram and Ahmedabad.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark65" class="h3" name="bookmark559">Evaluation as Plan Scheme </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark65" class="s52">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The 10th Plan document pointed out that one of the most common reasons for the failure of programmes and schemes was the faulty and incomplete design of the programme/projects/scheme. Care and attention must be taken to formulate programmes, projects and schemes in a more systematic and professional manner. It is essential to strengthen the existing mechanisms for <span class="s22">monitoring </span>and <span class="s22">evaluation</span>, in order to make sure that plans are being implemented as envisaged and the impact is also as planned. The strategy proposed above would definitely contribute to efficiency in resource use and improved performances of plan programmes. But the evaluation capacity within and outside the government is limited. To make evaluation, an effective tool for this, capabilities of evaluation organisations will have to be enhanced. The <span class="s22">‘Working Group for Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation System’ </span>set up (late 2012) by the PC recommended to enhance the evaluation capacity and incorporate evaluation in the Plan Scheme.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The PEO also encourages State Evaluation Organisations (SEOs) to send the evaluation reports to the PC so that these reports can also be put on the Internet (now, it may be sent to the <span class="s51">NITI Aayog</span>—a decision yet to be taken by the government). By late 2014, the government decided to strengthen the PEO—further actions in this direction is awaited.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part89.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part91.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
