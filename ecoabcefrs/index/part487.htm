This basically belonged to a long list of guidelines for managerial excellence and success, others being Management by Objectives (MBO), Matrix Management, Portfolio Management, etc to name a few.</a><span style=" color: #808908; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">51</span><span class="s336"> </span>It was the US financial expert <span class="s334">Peter Phyrr </span><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2354" class="s58">who first proposed this idea for government budgeting and Jimmy Carter, Govornor of Georgia, USA was the first elected</a><span style=" color: #808908; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">52</span><span class="s336"> </span>executive to introduce ZBB to the public sector.

Some experts say it in a different way, there are three essential questions which must be answered objectively before going for any expenditure as per the techniques of ZBB:</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Should we spend?</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">How much should we spend?</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Where should we spend?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;">There are <span class="s333">three </span>special features of this budgeting which distinguishes it from the traditional budgeting. These features, in brief, are as under:</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The conventional aggregate approach is not applied in it, in which each department of the government prepares their own budget for many activities in the aggregate and composite form, making it difficult to scrutinise each and every activity. In place of it every department needs to justify its existence and continuance in the budget document by using the mathematical technique of econometrics, i.e., cost-benefit analysis. In a nutshell, every activity of each department is ‘X-rayed’ and once the justification is validated they are allocated the funds.</span></p><p class="s333" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s339">(ii) </span>Economy <span class="p">in public expenditure is the </span>raison d’etre <span class="p">of this budgeting. This is why the ZBB has provisions of close examination and scrutiny of each programme and public spending. Finally, the public spending is cut without affecting the current level of benefits of various public services accruing to the public.</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <i>Prioritising </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">the competing needs is another special feature of ZBB. Before allocating funds to the different needs of the economy, an order of priority is prepared with utmost objectivity. As the resources/funds are always scarce, in the process of prioritised allocation, the item/items at the bottom might not get any funds.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Side by side its benefits, there are certain <span class="s334">limitations </span>too before the ZBB which prohibits its assumed success, according to experts. These limitations have made it subject to criticisms. The limitations are as given below:</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">There are certain expenditures upon which the government/parliament</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">does not have the power of scrutiny (as the ‘Charged Expenditure’ in India).</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">There are certains public services which defy the cost-benefit analysis— defence, law and order, foreign relations, etc.</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Scrutiny is a subjective matter and so this might become prey to bias. Again, if the scrutinisers have a complete utilitarian view many long- term objectives of budgeting and public policy might get marginalised.</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">It has scope for emergence of the Ministry of Finance as the all- powerful institution dictating other ministries and departments.</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Bureaucracy does not praise it as it evaluates their decisions and performances in a highly objective way.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Despite the above-given strong limitation, the ZBB has a sound logic and should be considered a long-term budgetary reform process. The basic idea of this form of budgeting is to optimise the benefits of expenditure in every area of activity and in this sense it is exceptional. To the extent the corporate world is concerned, this has been a very successful financial management tool.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In India, it is believed to be in practice since 1997–99. We cannot say that India is a success in ZBB, but many of the profit-fetching PSUs have been able to use it successfully and optimise their profits.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part486.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part488.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
