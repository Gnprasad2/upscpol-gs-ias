It was for the <span class="s334">first time </span>in the fiscal history of India that we see a long-term perspective coming on the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">fiscal issue from the government. This also included the policy of government expenditure. The paper was bold enough to recognise the deterioration in India’s fiscal position and accepted it among the most important challenges of the eighties—the paper set specific targets and policies to set the things right. This paper was followed by a country-wide debate on the issue and it was in 1987 that the government came ahead with <span class="s334">two </span>bold steps in the direction—</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">a virtual freeze was announced on government expenditure, and</span></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">a ceiling on the budgetary deficit.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2237">The above steps had a positive impact on the situation but it was temporary as since mid-1988 the situation again started deteriorating.

The IMF support to fight the crisis came in but with many macro-economic conditionalities, checking the fiscal meance being a major one among them. With the process of economic reforms which started in 1991–92, the government also announced its commitment to reduce fiscal deficit to 3–4 per cent (of GDP) by the mid- 1990s (from the level of about 8 per cent during 1987–90). This step was among the many measures which the government started with the objective of stabilising the economy. We may have a look at India’s fiscal situation upto the 1990–91 in the following way:</p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2238">(i) </a><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2333" class="s58">The fiscal deficits of the central government, after averaging below 4 per cent of the GDP till the 1970s started climbing up by being 5.77 per cent in 1980–81, 8.47 per cent in 1986–87 ending up at 7.85 per cent in 1990–91 after being above 7 per cent in the second half of the 1980s.</a><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2333" class="s335">31</a></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2239">(ii) </a><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2334" class="s58">The revenue (i.e., current) expenditure of the government (Centre and states combined) increased from 11.8 per cent of GDP to 23 per cent between 1960 and 1990. The revenue receipts of the government also went up on an average of 14.6 per cent in 1971–75 to 20 per cent in 1986–1990. But the gap between revenue receipts and expenditures remained negative—financed largely by domestic borrowings (as a result the interest payments on domestic debt increased from 0.5 to 2.5 per cent of the GDP during 1975–90.</a><span style=" color: #808908; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">32 </span><span style=" color: #000F67;">The revenue deficit went on increasing</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;"><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2335" class="s58" name="bookmark2240">after 1979–80 and reached the highest level of 3.26 per cent of the GDP in 1990–91.</a><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2335" class="s335">33</a></p><p class="s339" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2241">(iii) </a><a href="part497.htm#bookmark2336" class="s58">The fiscal situation of the states was not good either.

To the extent ‘exact’ follow-up to the FRBMA- linked targets are concerned, the performance has been mixed. The targets were exceeded many times due to fiscal escalations (either due to natural calamities or on exceptional ground), while many times they were better than the mandated targets, too. But this act brought the element of higher fiscal discipline among the governments, there is no doubt in it</a><span style=" color: #808908; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;   font-size: 125%; vertical-align: 5pt;">44</span>.<a name="bookmark2252">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In the past few years a view has emerged as per which binding the government expenditures to a fixed number may be counterproductive to the economy at large. Due to a hard and fast discipline regarding fiscal targets, some highly desirable expenditures by the government may get blocked, for example—expenditures on infrastructure, welfare, etc. This is why we find a changed stance of the Government of India in the <span class="s336">Union Budget 2016–17 </span>regarding the follow-up to the FRBMA. Terming it a <span class="s333">new school of thought </span>the Budget suggests two important changes in its fiscal road map:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #808908;">(i) </span>It may be better to have a fiscal deficit <span class="s333">range </span>as the target in place of a fixed <span class="s333">number </span>as target.
