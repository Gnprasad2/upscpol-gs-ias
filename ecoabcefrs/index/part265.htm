The Indian management consulting market, on the other hand, is mainly captured by large size foreign multinational consulting firms. Though there are huge opportunities for the growth of the Indian consulting industry, there are some key inhibitors like low brand equity, inadequate international experience of Indian consultants working abroad, lack of local presence, lack of strategic tie-ups, low competency image, lack of market intelligence on consulting opportunities abroad and lack of a strong competency framework of consultants that improves quality in delivery of consulting assignments.

Unhindered flow of goods and services is an essential pre- requisite for building a common market that will promote growth, trade across regions and also enable specialization and higher levels of economic efficiency.

Online travel accounts for nearly 61 per cent of e- commerce business while e-tailing constitutes about 29 per cent. Some estimates indicate that companies will spend between US $1 billion and US $2 billion on e-commerce-related infrastructure over the next five years.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #E8521F;">• </span>No official data is available on the direct selling/multi-level marketing (MLM) sector. According to a <span class="s190">KPMG-FICCI </span>study (December 2015), the direct selling market in India has grown at a CAGR of 16 per cent over the last five years from Rs. 41 billion in 2009–10 to Rs. 75 billion in 2013–14. Total employment in this sector is around 5.8 million. There is at present no separate legislation for regulation of direct selling activities, hence they come directly under the purview of the <span class="s190">Prize Chits &amp; Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act 1978</span>, administered by the Department of Financial Services. As it is a banning act, there is no provision for differentiating the genuine direct selling business from banned pyramid/money circulation schemes, and this has resulted in alleged harassment/ criminal action against the industry. An inter-</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ministerial committee was constituted on 12 November 2014 to examine the need for a separate legislation for this sector.
