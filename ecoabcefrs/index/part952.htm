At COP 22, Parties agreed to a deadline of 2018 for the rule book. Detailing exercise will include accounting of the NDCs, adaptation communication, building a transparency framework, global stock take every five years, etc. The key decision adopted at COP 22 were—</p><p class="s406" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The sense of urgency to take action on climate change;</span></p><p class="s406" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The need to strengthen and support efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security and enhance resilience of agriculture; and</span></p><p class="s406" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The pre-2020 action including mobilization of USD 100 billion per year.</span></p><p class="s405" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">India’s green actions: <span class="p">India ratified the Paris Agreement on 2nd October 2016. India’s comprehensive NDC target is to lower the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels, to increase the share of non-fossil fuels based power generation capacity to 40 per cent of installed electric power capacity by 2030, and to create an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5–3 GtCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.

In order to achieve the target, several programmes/schemes are being implemented by the government. As a result of various actions in the right direction, India attained <span class="s403">4th position </span>in global wind power installed capacity after China, USA and Germany. India achieved 46.3 GW grid-interactive power capacity; 7.5 GW of grid-connected power generation capacity in renewable energy; and small hydro power capacity of 4.3 GW by October 2016.

ISA is expected to become inter-governmental treaty-based organization that will be registered under Article 102 of the UN charter after 15 countries ratify the Agreement.

The Clean Environment Cess has been doubled in the 2016–17 to Rs. 400 per tonne. The proceeds of the NCEF are being used to finance projects under Green Energy Corridor for boosting up the transmission sector, Namami Gange, Green India Mission, Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, installation of SPV lights and small capacity lights, installation of SPV water pumping systems, SPV Power Plants and Grid Connected Rooftop SPV Power Plants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part951.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part953.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
