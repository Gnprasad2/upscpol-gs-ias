Employment Generation</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The PSUs were also seen as an important part of the employment generation strategy. A government in a democratic set up cannot think only economics, but it has to realise the socio-political dimensions of the nation too. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">country was faced with the serious problem of poverty and the workforce was increasing at a fast rate. Giving employment to the poor people is a time- tested tool of poverty alleviation. The PSUs were thought to create enough jobs for the employable workforce of the economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There was also felt an immediacy for a social change in the country. The poverty of a greater section of the country was somehow connected to the age-old caste system which propitiated the stronghold of the upper castes on the ownership of land, which was the only means of income and livelihood for almost above 80 per cent of the population. Along with the ambitious policy of land reforms, the government decided to provide reservations to the weaker sections of the society in government jobs. The upcoming PSUs were supposed to put such jobs at the disposal of the goverment which could have been distributed along the decided reservation policy—such reservations were considered an economic tool for social change.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">In the highly capital-intensive sectors in which the government companies were going to enter, managing investible funds to set them up was not going to be an easy task. The government did manage the funds with sources like taxation, internal and external borrowing and even taking last refuge in the printing of fresh currencies. The government went to justify the high taxation and heavy public indebtness in supplying employment to the Indian employable population.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The PSUs were considered by the government as the focus of the ‘trickle- down effect’. The government did everything to set up and run the PSUs as the benefits were supposed to percolate to the masses, finally reinforcing growth and development in the country. Employment in the PSUs was seen as the effort of the trickle down theory, simply said. At a point of time, Nehru even mentioned the PSUs as the ‘temples of modern India’. The government went to commit even a job in every household via the PSUs—without calculating the dimensions of the future labour force in the country and the required resources to create jobs at such a high scale. But the government went on creating new PSUs without analysing the fiscal repercussions— moreover believing them to be the real engine of equitable growth. The employment generation responsibility of the PSUs was extended to such an extent by the government that most of them had over-supply of the labour force which started draining its profits on account of salaries, wages,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">pensions and provident funds (the latter two had late financial impact).</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part39.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part41.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
