Economic reforms exposed the economy to the new and emerging realities, such as, land acquisition and leasing, food-related issues and the agricultural provisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO). We see a shift <span class="s155">(Economic Survey</span></p><p class="s155" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2012–13) <span class="p">in the thinking of the Government of India towards the issue of land reforms—a clear three step policy looks emerging:</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Mapping land carefully and assigning conclusive title,</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Devising a fair but speedy process of land acquisition, and</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Putting in place a transparent and effective land leasing policy.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Land is probably the single most valuable asset in the country today. Not only could greater liquidity for land allow more resources to be redeployed efficiently in agriculture, it could ease the way for land-utilising businesses to set up. Perhaps, as important, it could allow land to serve as collateral for credit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The National Land Records Modernisation Programme (NLRMP), started in 2008, aims at updating and digitising land records by the end of the Twelfth Plan. Eventually, the intent is to move from <span class="s155">presumptive title </span>(where registration of a title does not imply the owner’s title is legally valid) to <span class="s155">conclusive title </span>(where it does). Important points related to this process may be summarised as follows:</p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Digitisation will help enormously in lowering the costs of land transactions, while conclusive title will eliminate legal uncertainty and the need to use the government as an intermediary for acquiring land so</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">as to ‘cleanse’ title.</p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Given the importance of this programme, its rollout in various states needs to be accelerated—easier and quicker land transactions will especially help small and medium enterprises that do not have the legal support or the management capacity that large enterprises have.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #C16E59;">(iii) </span>Prohibitory <span class="s155">land leasing norms </span>raises the cost to rural-urban migration, as villagers are unable to lease their land, and often have to leave the land untilled or leave a family member behind to work on the land. Lifting these restrictions can help the landless (or more efficient landowners) get land from those who migrate, even</p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">while it will allow landowners with education and skills to move to industry or services.</p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Compulsory registration of leaseholds and of the owner’s title would provide tenants and landowners protection. For such a leasing market to take off, owners should be confident that long-term tenancy would not lead to their losing ownership. With a vibrant leasing market, and clear title, there should be little reason for not strengthening ownership rights.</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">For large projects with a public purpose, such as the National Industrial and Manufacturing Zones, which will facilitate the setting up of small and medium enterprises, large-scale land acquisition may be necessary.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #C16E59;">(vi) </span>Given that the people currently living on the identified land will suffer significant costs including the loss of property and livelihoods, a balance has to be drawn between the need for economic growth and the costs imposed on the <span class="s155">displaced</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Moving onwards, the Government of India passed the <span class="s155">Land Acquisition Bill, 2013</span>. The bill, besides proposing to amend the <span class="s155">Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2011 </span>proposed to put in place a transparent, effective and speedy laws reagrding the need of land reforms related to leasing and acquisition. By 2015, the new government at the Centre proposed a new land bill <span class="s155">(Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2015)</span>, which aimed at removing the inadequacies of the Land Act of 2013. The Bill is being opposed by the political parties belonging to the opposition (it is still to be passed by the Parliament, though the government has done around ten</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">amendments to it). The country cannot afford to compromise the economic security of land owners (farmers) in the process of evolving a speedier process of land acquisition—the law dealing with it should be transparent, justified, effective and speedier, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1029">Finer points of this </a><span class="s155">PHASE </span><a href="part215.htm#bookmark1189" class="s58">can be summed up in the following way:</a><a href="part215.htm#bookmark1189" class="s153">17</a></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Leasing seems a better choice in face of farmer’s opposition seen in recent times in different states toward attempts at land acquisition. Again, if the country needs to attract investment from the organised private sector (domestic or foreign) land leasing seems a better option than land acquisition.</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Corporate farming has not taken place in the country in a big scale, especially in the areas of foodgrains production, which India needs to ensure food security and compete in the global grain market, in particular, and the agri-market in general. This has become even more important in the wake of the Right to Food given to a large segment of the population.</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Giving primacy to ‘leasing’ will solve several problems:</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(a) <span style=" color: #000F67;">It will keep land ownership in the hands of the existing farmers;</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(b) <span style=" color: #000F67;">It will prevent mass landlessness and unemployment among the farmers;</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(c) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Farmers will get a permanent source of income (in the meantime, they might be imparted skills and provide better employment in industries); and</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;">(d) <span style=" color: #000F67;">It will make land easily available for use of public and private purposes.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, the Model Land Leasing Law proposed by the NITI Aayog in 2016 is giving encouraging results in the states.</p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) <span style=" color: #000F67;">In the wake of the process of globalisation, if the country intends to bring in benefits to agriculture sector it needs to enhance its agriculture production to surplus levels—and for this India needs to garner in the investment potential of the private sector. This cannot happen till the country is able to bring out effective land leasing and acquisition policies.</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(v) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The recent emphasis on the promotion of the ‘manufacturing sector’ and ‘smart cities’ are hugely dependent on smoother and speedier process of land acquisition. Without expanding the industrial sector to its optimum levels, the agriculture sector can emerge a remunerative profession—the country needs to migrate the extra labour force of the agriculture sector to industry, smoothly.</span></p><p class="s152" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(vi) <span style=" color: #000F67;">The issue of land acquisition is to establish a logical equation with ‘environmental issue’, in order to make the process of development sustainable (NITI Aayog gives a right call for it).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">It should be noted that while the Government of India has changed its orientation towards the issue of land reforms, the states in India are still trying to accelerate and continue the process of land reforms of <span class="s155">PHASE I </span>(but due to enough resistance from the land-owning section in the country, the process does not seem happening, politically).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="part1.htm#bookmark51" class="s156" name="bookmark1030">Agriculture Holdings </a><a href="part1.htm#bookmark51" class="s157">                                     </a></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The average size of land holding in India is continuously decreasing due to rapid and high population growth. The continuous division and fragmentation of holdings has increased the number of holdings, obviously of smaller size.
