This can be imparted through vocational education and training. However, there is a perception that vocational education and skill development are meant for people who have failed to join mainstream education. This perception is strengthened by the significantly lower wages paid to employees with vocational training vis-à-vis those with formal education.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">There is a severe quality gap and lack of availability of trainers in the vocational education and training sector as per the NSDC (National Skill Development Corporation). By 2017, this skill gap within the vocational training sector including both teachers and non-teachers will reach a figure of 211,000. The workforce requirement is projected to increase to 320,000 by 2022. Some <span class="s400">recent steps </span>taken by the GoI, in this regard, are as given below:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #EB008C;">• </span>The NSDC has given a big thrust towards this. The establishment of the <span class="s399">National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) </span>is aimed at bridging skill gap in the higher education.</p><p class="s159" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <span style=" color: #000F67;">The SSCs (Sector Skill Councils) as autonomous industry-led bodies through the NSDC create National Occupational Standards (NOSs) and Qualification Packs (QP) for each job role in the sector, develop</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">competency frameworks, conduct training of trainers, conduct skill gap studies and assess through independent agencies and certify trainees on the curriculum aligned to NOSs developed by them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #EB008C;">• </span>The <span class="s399">PMKVY </span>(Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana), which targets offering 24 lakh Indian youth meaningful, industry-relevant, skill-based training and a government certification on successful completion of training along with assessment to help them secure a job for a better future.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #EB008C;">• </span>The <span class="s399">DDU-GKY </span>(Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana), a placement-linked skill development scheme for rural youth (who are poor), as a skilling component of the NRLM (National rural Livelihood Mission) has also been launched.</p><p class="s159" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <i>National Action Plan (NAP) </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">for skill and training has been launched with a view to increasing the scope of employability among differently- abled persons.</span></p><p class="s159" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">• <i>National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015 </i><span style=" color: #000F67;">aims to ensure skilling on a large scale at a speed with high Standards and promote a culture of innovation based entrepreneurship to ensure sustainable livelihoods.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">India has one of the youngest populations in the world. Given this, there is immense potential for overseas employment opportunities for skilled persons from India. The process of mapping such opportunities through the NSDC is also in progress.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part934.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part936.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
