(RCTC)—when it also introduced the Technology Finance and Development Scheme (TFDS) for financing development and commercialisation of indigenous technology. Besides, under Risk Capital Scheme, RCTC started providing financial assistance to entrepreneurs by way of direct equity participation. Based on IFCI Venture’s credentials and strengths, Unit Trust of India (UTI), entrusted RCTC with the management of a new venture capital fund named <span class="s202">Venture Capital Unit Scheme (VECAUS-III) </span>in 1991 with its funds coming from the UTI and IFCI. To reflect the shift in the company’s activities, the name of RCTC was changed to IFCI Venture Capital Funds Ltd. (IFCI Venture) in February 2000.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In order to focus on Asset Management Activities, IFCI Venture discontinued Risk Capital and Technology Finance Schemes in 2000-01 and continued managing VECAUS-III. In 2007, as UTI had ceased to carry out its activities and its assets vested with <span class="s202">Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI)</span>, the portfolio of VECAUS-III under management of IFCI Venture was transferred to SUUTI.</p><p class="s200" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s203">(b) </span>Tourism Finance Corporation of India Ltd (TFCI), 1989: <span class="p">The Government of India had, on the recommendations of the National Committee on Tourism </span>(Yunus Committee) <span class="p">set up under the aegis of the Planning Commission, decided in 1988, to promote a separate All India Financial Institution for providing financial assistance to tourism-related activities/projects.

TFCI was notified as a Public Financial Institution in January 1990. Its promoter, the IFCI, holds major share (41.6 per cent) in it, while the rest of the shares are with the ‘public’ (26 per cent), public sector banks, public insurance companies and public mutual fund (i.e., UTI Mutual Fund Ltd.).</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part278.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part280.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
