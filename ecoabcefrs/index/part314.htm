They are created mainly for cultivating the habit of <span class="s211">thrift </span>and <span class="s211">savings </span>amongst its members. The companies doing Nidhi business, viz., borrowing from members and lending to members only, are known under different names such as <span class="s211">Nidhi, Permanent Fund, Benefit Funds, Mutual Benefit Funds </span>and <span class="s211">Mutual Benefit Company.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Nidhis are more popular in <span class="s210">South India </span>and are highly localised single</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">office institutions. They are mutual benefit societies, because their dealings are restricted only to the members; and membership is limited to individuals. The principal source of funds is the contribution from the members. The loans are given to the members at relatively reasonable rates for purposes, such as house construction or repairs and are generally secured. The deposits mobilised by Nidhis are not much when compared to the organised banking sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Nidhis are companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and are regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). Even though Nidhis are regulated by the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, they are exempted from certain provisions of the Act, as applicable to other companies, due to limiting their operations within members.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Nidhis are also included in the definition of <span class="s210">NBFCs, </span>which operate mainly in the <span class="s211">unorganised money market</span>. However, since 1997, NBFCs have been brought increasingly under the regulatory ambit of the RBI. Non-banking financial entities partially or wholly regulated by the RBI include:</p><p class="s214" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(i) <span style=" color: #000F67;">NBFCs comprising equipment leasing (EL), hire purchase finance (HP), loan (LC), investment (IC) [including primary dealers (PDs) and residuary non-banking companies (RNBCs);</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #21AC8E;">(ii) </span>Mutual benefit financial company (MBFC), i.e., <span class="s211">nidhi company</span>;</p><p class="s214" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) <span style=" color: #000F67;">Mutual benefit company (MBC), i.e., potential nidhi company; i.e., a company which is working on the lines of a Nidhi company, but has not yet been so declared by the Central Government; has minimum net owned fund (NOF) of Rs.10 lakh, has applied to the RBI for certificate of registration and also to the Department of Company Affairs (DCA) for being notified as a Nidhi company and has not contravened directions / regulations of RBI/DCA.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #21AC8E;">(iv) </span>Miscellaneous non-banking company (MNBC), i.e., <span class="s211">chit fund company</span>.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Since Nidhis come under one class of NBFCs, RBI is empowered to issue directions to them in matters relating to their deposit acceptance activities. However, in recognition of the fact that these Nidhis deal with their shareholder-members only, RBI has exempted the notified Nidhis from the core provisions of the RBI Act and other directions applicable to NBFCs. As on date <span class="s211">(February 2013) </span>RBI does not have any specified regulatory</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">framework for Nidhis.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The Central Government in March 2000 constituted a committee to examine the various aspects of the functioning of Nidhi Companies. There was no government notification defining the word ‘Nidhi’. Taking into consideration the manner of functioning of Nidhis and the recommendations of the <span class="s211">P. Sabanayagam Committee </span>in its report and also to prevent unscrupulous persons using the word ‘Nidhi’ in their name without being incorporated by the Department of Company Affairs (DCA) and yet doing Nidhi business, the committee suggested the following <span class="s210">definition </span>for Nidhis (a part of this definition is appearing in the new <span class="s211">Companies Bill 2012 (Section 406):</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">“Nidhi is a company formed with the exclusive object of cultivating the habit of thrift, savings and functioning for the mutual benefit of members by receiving deposits only from individuals enrolled as members and by lending only to individuals, also enrolled as members, and which functions as per Notification and Guidelines prescribed by the DCA. The word Nidhi shall not form part of the name of any company, firm or individual engaged in borrowing and lending money without incorporation by DCA and such contravention will attract penal action.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part313.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part315.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
