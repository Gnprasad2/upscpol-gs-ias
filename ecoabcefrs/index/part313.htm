Business goals are often different, and both business types are after profits, but holding companies can still benefit from operating company losses under certain conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">The primary function of a <span class="s210">holding company </span>is to invest in other companies, commonly known as subsidiaries. Holding companies are usually not involved in day-to-day operations of the operating company, but lend initial or ongoing financial support via cash reserves or stock sales, and may assist in restructuring the operational model to ensure profits. Holding companies are normally structured as <span class="s211">corporations </span>(limited liability firms i.e., known as a <span class="s213">Ltd. </span>company in India) to protect assets and absorb financial losses.</p><p class="s210" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Operating companies <span class="p">are owned by the holding company, but are responsible for all day-to-day operations of the company. When a holding company creates or purchases an operating company, they are sometimes allowed to conduct business as usual, especially, if they are profitable. Net profits after expenses are then handed over to the holding company.</span></p><p class="s211" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Ownership <span class="p">of operating companies, even when purchased, revert to the holding company. Former owners who are kept on-board are often given control of the operating company in the form of executive management responsibility, but have no ownership rights. All major decisions that may affect profitability or involve large expenditures must first be approved by the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">holding company.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Although operating companyâ€™s <span class="s211">profitability </span>should make sense for the holding company, this is not always the case. Especially for larger holding companies with heavy tax burdens, owning one or more operating companies that lose money can benefit the parent company in the form of a business loss when tax time rolls around. This does not benefit the operating company, as it is responsible for operating income to run the business. If the losses become too great, operating companies can go out of business, but the holding company can still benefit because the operating company can help to balance overall profits and stock prices.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are <span class="s211">three basic types </span>of holding companies:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #21AC8E;">(i) </span>A <span class="s211">pure holding company </span>that is non-operating and exists solely to invest in and hold the voting shares of its subsidiaries. This type of holding company derives its income from the dividends earned from its ownership of the shares of its subsidiaries and from any gains realised from other investments.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #21AC8E;">(ii) </span>A <span class="s211">general </span>or <span class="s211">operating holding company </span>that earns its income from selling goods and services in addition to the income derived from its ownership of subsidiaries.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #21AC8E;">(iii) </span>A <span class="s211">pyramid holding company </span>that owns controlling interest in its subsidiaries with less invested capital than the two other categories.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part312.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part314.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
