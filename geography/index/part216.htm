At the ‘shoulder’ of north-east Brazil, the protruding land mass splits the South Equatorial Current into the Cayenne Current which flows along the Guiana coast, and the Brazilian Current which flows southwards along the east coast of Brazil.</span></p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;"><span class="s4"> ⧫       </span><span class="p">In the North Atlantic Ocean, the Cayenne Current is joined and reinforced by the North Equatorial Current and heads north-westwards as a large mass of equatorial water into the Caribbean Sea. Part of the current enters the Gulf of Mexico and emerges from the Florida Strait between Florida and Cuba as the Florida Current. The rest of the equatorial water flows northwards east of the Antilles to join the Gulf Stream off the south-eastern U.S.A. The Gulf Stream Drift is one of the strongest ocean currents, 35 to 100 miles wide, 2,000 feet deep and with a velocity of three miles an hour. The current hugs the coast of America as far as Cape Hatteras (latitude 35°N.), where it is </span>de<span class="s18">fl</span>ected eastwards <span class="p">under the combined influence of the </span>Westerlies <span class="p">and the </span>rotation <span class="p">of the earth. It reaches Europe as the North Atlantic Drift. This current, flowing at 10 miles per day, carries the warm equatorial water for over a thousand miles to the coasts of Europe. From the North Atlantic, it fans out in three directions, eastwards to Britain, northwards to the Arctic and southwards along the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Iberian coast, as the cool Canaries Current. Oceanographic researches show that almost two- thirds of the water brought by the Gulf Stream to the Arctic regions is returned annually to the tropical latitudes by dense, cold polar water that creeps southwards in the ocean depths. The Canaries Current flowing southwards eventually merges with the North Equatorial Current, completing the clockwise circuit in the North Atlantic Ocean. Within this ring of currents, an area in the middle of the Atlantic has no perceptible current. A large amount of floating sea-weed gathers and the area is called the Sargasso Sea.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">Apart from the clockwise circulation of the currents, there are also currents that enter the North Atlantic from the Arctic regions. These cold waters are blown south by the out-flowing polar winds. The Irminger Current or East Greenland Current flows between Iceland and Greenland and cools the North Atlantic Drift at the point of convergence. The cold Labrador Current drifts south-eastwards between West Greenland and Baﬃn Island to meet the warm Gulf Stream off Newfoundland, as far south as 50°N. where the icebergs carried south by the Labrador Current melt.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">The South Atlantic Ocean follows the same pattern of circulation as the North Atlantic Ocean. The major differences are that the circuit is anti-clockwise and the collection of sea-weed in the still waters of the mid-South Atlantic is not so distinctive.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">Where the South Equatorial Current is split at Cape Sao Roque, one branch turns south as the warm Brazilian Current.
