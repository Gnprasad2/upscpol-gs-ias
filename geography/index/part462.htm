Tobago and Guyana), Fiji and South Africa by British from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar; to Reunion Island, Guadeloupe. Martinique and Surinam by French and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">Dutch and by Portuguese from Goa, Daman and Diu to Angola, Mozambique to work as plantation workers. All such migrations were covered under the time-bound contract known as Girmit Act (Indian Emigration Act). These labourers were living in inhuman conditions and their living conditions were as bad as those of slaves.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">The second wave </span><span class="p">of migrants went to settle in the neighbouring countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and some African countries. This is a recent development under which professionals, artisans, traders, factory workers went out of the country in search of better quality of life. This trend is still continuing. In the 1970s, there was oil boom in West Asia and a large number of skilled and semi-skilled workers went there to avail of the opportunity. Some entrepreneurs, store owners, professionals, businessmen etc. went to western countries also.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">The third wave </span><span class="p">started in 1960s and still continues to operate. In this period high profi le professionals like doctors, engineers etc. migrated out of India. In 1980s, software engineers, management consultants, financial experts, media persons etc. moved out of the country to work in countries like the U.S.A., Canada, U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Germany etc. After liberalisation in 1991, education and knowledge based Indian migration has made Indian Diaspora most powerful in the world.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part461.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part463.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
