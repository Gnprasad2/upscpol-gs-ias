Thus, northern part of the India lies in sub-tropical and temperate zone and the part lying south of the Tropic of Cancer falls in the tropical zone. The tropical zone being nearer to the equator, experiences high temperatures throughout the year with small daily and annual range. Area north of the Tropic of Cancer being away from the equator, experiences extreme climate with high daily and annual range of temperature.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">The Himalayan Mountains: </span><span class="p">The lofty Himalayas in the north along with its extensions act as an effective climatic divide. The towering mountain chain provides an invincible shield to protect the subcontinent from the cold northern winds. These cold and chilly winds originate near the Arctic Circle and blow across central and eastern Asia. The Himalayas also trap the monsoon winds, forcing them to shed their moisture within the subcontinent.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Distribution of Land and Water: </span><span class="p">India is flanked by the Indian Ocean on three sides in the south and girdled by a high and continuous mountain-wall in the north. As compared to the landmass, water heats up or cools down slowly. This differential heating of land and sea creates different air pressure zones in different seasons in and around the Indian subcontinent. Difference in air pressure causes reversal in the direction of monsoon winds.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Distance from the Sea: </span><span class="p">With a long coastline, large coastal areas have an equable climate. Areas in the interior of India are far away from the moderating influence of the sea. Such areas have extremes of climate. That is why; the people of Mumbai and the Konkan coast have hardly any idea of extremes of temperature and the seasonal rhythm of weather. On the other hand, the seasonal contrasts in weather at places in the interior of the country such as Delhi, Kanpur and Amritsar affect the entire sphere of life.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Altitude: Temperature </span><span class="p">decreases with height. Due to thin air, places in the mountains are cooler than places on the plains. For example, Agra and Darjeeling are located on the same latitude, but temperature of January in Agra is 16°C whereas it is only 4°C in Darjeeling.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Relief: </span><span class="p">The physiography or relief of India also affects the temperature, air pressure, direction and speed of wind and the amount and distribution of rainfall. The windward sides of Western Ghats and Assam receive high rainfallduring June-September whereas the southern plateau remains dry due to its leeward situation along the Western Ghats.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part253.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part255.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
