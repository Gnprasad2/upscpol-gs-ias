The monsoon season in India generally starts in last week of May and first week of June varying year to year. The weather conditions change. The relative humidity of the atmosphere increases, sky is over cast with clouds, atmospheric temperature increases before the outbreak of monsoon and there may be some spells of pre monsoon showers.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">As the monsoon comes, there is significant fall in the atmospheric temperature ranging from 3°C to 6°C lower than the month of June in the Himalayan region. After this sudden fall in temperature, there is no further fall in temperature throughout the season. However in the month of September, as the monsoon starts to retreat there is an increase in temperature for a short time period. The night temperature is more or less constant while the day temperature fluctuates on day to day basis. The diurnal temperature range is less and varies between 4°C to 6°C due to the greenhouse effect created by the clouds.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">The eastern Himalayas get the monsoonal rain earlier than the western Himalayas due to nearness to the sea and the direction of movement of the Bay of Bengal branch of monsoon wind. Around June 5, the monsoon breaks in eastern Himalayas. From here, due to the barrier effect of the Himalayas and the orientation of the Himalayas, the Bay of Bengal branch moves westerly along the foothills of Himalayas into the Ganga plains.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">The Arabian Sea branch moving on the eastern side of the Aravalis after being deflected due to the orientation of Western Ghats meets Bay of Bengal branch at Agra and moves towards Kashmir. The monsoon breaks in the western Himalayan region around 1st of July.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">But in the western Himalayan region, the precipitation is not as intensive as in the eastern region because most of the moisture is lost during journey of the monsoon winds up till here due to precipitation.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">However the Arabian Sea branchbrings more precipitation due to its shorter length of journey uptill western Himalayas. Heavy rainfall is caused in the eastern Himalayas, sub Himalayan regions and the southern slopes of Himalayas. This leads to high flooding of the rivers having their catchment areas in Himalayas.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">For eg.: Brahmaputra receives the water of the eastern Himalayas causing floods in the Assam plains, Kosi River receives the water of eastern Nepal Himalayas by Saptakosi catchment area causing floods in Bihar plains, etc. The western Himalayan region receives around 65 cm of average rainfall in the monsoon season, while the eastern Himalayas, as explained earlier, experience the precipitation around 200 cm to 410 cm on an average, while on some places, it reaches to as high as 600 cm also.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part257.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part259.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
