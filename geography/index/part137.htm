This is because the rays of the sun fall vertical on the equator and slanting in the temperate and polar regions. Therefore, lower the latitude higher is the temperature and vice versa.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Altitude or the Height from the mean sea level: </span><span class="p">The temperature decreases with increase in height as atmosphere is heated from below.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Continentality or the Distance from the Sea: </span><span class="p">The water is a bad conductor of heat i.e. It takes longer time to heat and longer time to cool. Due to this moderating effect of the sea, places near the coast have low range of temperature and high humidity. The places in the interior of the continent do not experience moderating effect of the sea. These places have extreme temperatures. Mumbai has relatively lower temperature and higher rainfall than Nagpur, although both are almost situated on the same latitude.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Nature of the Prevailing Winds: </span><span class="p">The on-shore winds bring the moisture from the sea and cause rainfall on the area through which they pass. The off -shore winds coming from the land are dry and help in evaporation. In India, the on-shore summer monsoon winds bring rains while off -shore winter monsoon winds are generally dry.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Cloud Cover: </span><span class="p">In areas generally of cloudless sky as in deserts, temperature even under shade is very high because of the hot day time sunshine. At night this heat radiates back from the ground very rapidly. It results in a large diurnal range in temperature. On the other hand under cloudy sky and heavy rainfall at Thiruvananthapuram the range of temperature is very small.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Ocean Currents: </span><span class="p">Ocean waters move from one place to another partly as an attempt to equalize temperature and density of water. The warm ocean currents raise the temperature of the coast and sometimes bring rainfall, while the cold currents lower the temperature and create fog near the coast. Port Bergen in Norway is free from ice even in winter due to warm North Atlantic Drift while Port Quebec in Canada remains frozen during winter months due to chilling effect of the Cold Labrador Current in spite of the fact that Port Quebec is situated in much lower latitude than Port Bergen.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Direction of Mountain Chains: </span><span class="p">The mountain chains act as natural barrier for the wind. The on- shore moisture laden winds are forced to rise after striking against the mountain; and give heavy rainfall on the windward side. These winds descending on the leeward side cause very low rainfall. The great Himalayas check the moisture laden monsoon winds from crossing over to Tibet. This mountain chain also checks biting polar cold winds from entering into India. This is the reason for which northern plains of India get rains while Tibet remains a perpetual rain shadow area with lesser amount of rainfall.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Slope: </span><span class="p">The concentration of heat being more on the gentler slope raises the temperature of air above them. Its lesser concentration along steeper slopes lowers the temperature. At the same time, mountain slopes facing the sun are warmer than the slopes which are away from the sun’s rays. The southern slopes of Himalaya are warmer than the northern slopes.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">The Nature of the Soil and Vegetation Cover: </span><span class="p">The nature of soil depends upon its texture, structure and composition. These, qualities vary from soil to soil.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part136.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part138.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
