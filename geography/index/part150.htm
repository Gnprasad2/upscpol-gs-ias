It is just reverse of the process of evaporation. When the temperature of saturated air falls below dew point, the air cannot hold the amount of humidity which it was holding earlier at a higher temperature. This extra amount of humidity changes into water droplets or crystals of ice depending upon the temperature at which condensation takes place.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">The temperature of the air falls in two ways. Firstly, cooling occurs around very small particles of freely floating air when it comes in contact with some colder object. Secondly, loss in air temperature takes place on a massive scale due to rising of air to higher altitudes.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">The condensation takes place around the smoke, salt and dust particles which attract water vapourto condense around them. They are called hygroscopic nuclei. When the relative humidity of an air is high, a slight cooling is required to bring the temperature down below dew point.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">But when the relative humidity is low and the temperature of the air is high, a lot of cooling of the air will be necessary to bring the temperature down below dew point. Thus, condensation is directly related to the relative humidity and the rate of cooling.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">Condensation takes place in two situations, firstly, when dew point is below freezing point or below 0°C and secondly, when it is above freezing point. In this way, the forms of condensation may be classified into two groups:</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> ⧫    <span class="p">Frost, snow and some clouds are formed when dew point is below freezing point.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> ⧫    <span class="p">Dew, mist, fog, smog and some clouds are formed when dew point is above freezing point</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="p">The forms of condensation may also be classified on the basis of place where it is occurring, for example, on the ground or natural objects such as grass blades and leaves of the plants or trees, in the air close to the earth’s surface or at some height in the troposphere.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Dew:</span><span class="p">When the atmospheric moisture is condensed and deposited in the form of water droplets on cooler surface of solid objects such as grass blades, leaves of plants and trees and stones, it is termed as dew. Condensation in dew form occurs when there is clear sky, little or no wind, high relative humidity and cold long nights. These conditions lead to greater terrestrial radiation and the solid objects become cold enough to bring the temperature of air downbelow dew point. In this process the extra moisture of the air gets deposited on these objects. Dew is formed when dew point is above freezing point.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Frost:</span><span class="p">When the dew point is below freezing point, under above mentioned conditions, the condensation of extra moisture takes place in the form of very minute particles of ice crystals. It is called frost. In this process, the air moisture condenses directly in the form of tiny crystal of ice. This form of condensation is disastrous for standing crops such as potato, peas, pulses, grams, etc. It also creates problems for road transport system.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Mist and Fog:</span><span class="p">When condensation takes place in the air near the earth’s surface in the form of tiny droplets of water hanging and floating in the air, it is called mist. In mist the visibility is more than one kilometer and less than two kilometers. But when the visibility is reduced to less than one kilometer, it is called fog. Ideal conditions for the formation of mist and fog are clear sky, calm and cold winter nights.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Smog:</span><span class="p">Smog is a fog that has been polluted and discoloured by smoke, dust, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and other fumes. Smog frequently occurs in large cities and industrial centres. It causes respiratory illness.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -14pt;    text-align: justify;">      ⧪ <span class="s5">Clouds:</span><span class="p">Clouds are visible aggregates of water droplets, ice particles, or a mixture of both along with varying amounts of dust particles. A typical cloud contains billions of droplets having diameters on the order 0.01 to 0.02 mm; yet liquid or solid water accounts for less than 10 parts per million of the cloud volume. Clouds are generally classified on the basis of their general form or appearance and altitude.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part149.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part151.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
