Delink <b>provisions of compulsory requirement of space </b>for registration of traders.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">2. Integration of Domestic Markets with International Markets<span class="p">: The barriers in free marketing across different states especially for foodgrains should be dismantled. This calls for dismantling of restrictions on pricing, trading, distribution and movement of agricultural products within the country. Further, India, being a signatory to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement, should do away with physical barriers, both for imports and exports, on various agricultural commodities. Simultaneously, it should reduce tariff barriers within a time frame. These steps could facilitate the integration of domestic markets with international markets in due course.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">3. Strengthening Co-operative Marketing Societies<span class="p">: The progress made by co-operative marketing societies so far, though noteworthy, is not wholly satisfactory. Co-operatives have yet to cover a substantial part of the total agricultural produce. It is, therefore, essential that these co-operatives develop at a faster speed and along right lines. Marketing societies need to be more closely intertwined with other societies dealing with farming inputs, credit, etc. The best way to do so is to establish multipurpose societies to look after all the aspects of agricultural marketing. These societies, apart from organizing the sale of agricultural produce, should undertake construction of their own storage capacity, provide for their own transport, arrange for the processing of produce, grade their goods, organize exports, etc. This will reduce their dependence on other sources and provide a total view of marketing services to the members.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">4. Strengthening of Regulated Market Structure<span class="p">: The management of regulated markets is entrusted to agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs) on which different interests are represented. There is an urgent need to make these market committees viable and managerially competent in keeping with liberalized trade atmosphere. The market committees should be headed by marketing professionals. Further, the present number of regulated markets is not enough to meet the growing requirements of the country. There is also an urgent need to develop rural periodic markets in a phased manner with necessary infrastructural amenities to have a strong grass-root level link in the marketing chain.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><a href=" "></a></p> <p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">5. Re-framing Price Stabilization Policy<span class="p">: With a view to provide remunerative price to the farmer, food at affordable price to the consumer and sustained growth of marketable surplus, all undesirable restrictions on agricultural trade has to be removed. Public procurement, storage and distribution of foodgrains need to be managed efficiently on commercial lines.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">6. Developing Efficient Commodity Futures Markets<span class="p">: In order to strengthen the future market Government should set up more commodity exchanges, improve the regulatory and supervisory systems, modernize clearing house operations, upgrade training facilities and establish an enabling legal framework to develop vibrant commodity futures market in India.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">7. Promoting Direct Marketing<span class="p">: Rythu Bazaars in Andhra Pradesh, Apni Mandis in Punjab &amp; Haryana and Uzavar Santhaigal in Tamil Nadu have shown success. In direct marketing, the market operates outside the purview of Agricultural Produce Marketing Act and will be owned by professional agencies, such as wholesalers, trade associations, NGOs or self-help groups (SHGs). Promotion of direct marketing as one of the alternative marketing structures is beneficial for the farmers as well as the buyers as it enables the former to meet the specific requirements of the latter. Direct marketing enables farmers and buyers to economize on transportation costs, handling charges, market fees, etc., to improve price realization considerably.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">8. Improving Transport Infrastructure<span class="p">: The traditional rural transport system should be improved. The public investments in the road, railway and waterways should be developed.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">9. Improving Storage Facility<span class="p">: The private sector needs to be encouraged to enter the warehousing and storage in a big way by extending proper incentives to it. Experiment of the creation of decentralised rural godowns also needs to be pursued more vigorously.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Village Panchayats, co-operatives, SHGs, farmers organisations, NGOs, etc., should also be encouraged to undertake warehousing activity under the scheme. In case of perishable commodities like fruits, vegetables and flowers, the complete cold chain comprising pre- cooling, grading, packaging, cold storage and refrigerated vans should be developed.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">10. Providing Processing, Packaging and Grading Facilities<span class="p">: Proper cleaning, grading and packaging of primary products will need greater attention not only in the physical markets, but also in the villages from where produce is brought to the market for sale. Besides, there is a need to educate the farmers for proper grading and packaging before they bring the produce to the market. In the changed context, new technologies of packing like tetra packs, ascetic packing, pouches, etc. need to be introduced.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">11. Making Available Credit for Marketing<span class="p">: Provision of credit by the organized financial system to support agricultural marketing has to grow further. Considerable amount of institutional financing for agricultural marketing is directed towards public organizations. The credit facility available to private traders is quite limited.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">12. Promoting Agricultural Marketing Research<span class="p">: The agricultural marketing research in the areas of agri-business management, post-harvest management, grading, standardization, quality assurance, export promotion and information technology should be promoted. The agriculture research institutes and universities should be further strengthened to undertake applied and operational research in agricultural marketing, impart training to market functionaries and provide consultancy services to the public as well as private organizations engaged in agricultural marketing. Further, conferences, seminars, and workshops should be conducted from time to time on current and relevant issues to facilitate exchange of views among various market functionaries.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1387.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1389.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
