To address these challenges government resorted to disinvestment with following objectives:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Reduce financial burden on Government</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Improve public finances</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Introduce, competition and market discipline</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Create Fund for infrastructure growth (NIF)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><a href=" "></a></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Encourage wider share of ownership</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Depoliticise non-essential services</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Up gradation of existing PSUs.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Initially only sick PSUs were to be disinvested but later others were also included but with a cap of 49% so that government remains majority stakeholder. As per Department of Disinvestment it was decided that 20 per cent of equity of PSUs will be disinvested incrementally and they will be sold to financial institutions, banks and employees etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, the disinvestments did not succeed as expected because:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">People were not taken into confidence before disinvestment was started; therefore whole move was opposed by certain group of people and parties in opposition.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">2006 CAG report found that the valuation of the companies&#39; assets was done without &quot;due seriousness&quot;.

It has approved an alternative mechanism to decide modalities related to stake sales in PSUs, so as to speed up and streamline the process. Under this mechanism, the quantum of disinvestment in a PSU will be decided on a case-by-case basis subject to Government retaining 51% stake.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part576.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part578.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
