There are two important concepts of equity: <i>horizontal equity </i>and <i>vertical equity</i>.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Horizontal equity <span class="p">means that taxpayers in similar financial condition should pay similar amounts in taxes.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Vertical equity <span class="p">is just as important, however. Vertical equity means that taxpayers who are better off should pay at least the same proportion of income in taxes as those who are less well off. Vertical equity involves classifying taxes as </span>regressive<span class="p">, </span>proportional<span class="p">, or </span>progressive.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Taxes can also be categorized as either <b>regressive, proportional, or progressive</b>, and the distinction has to do with the <i>behaviour of the tax as the taxable base (such as a household&#39;s income or a business&#39; profit) changes.(see graph below)</i></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;">♤<span class="s3"> </span><span class="s5">Progressive tax</span><span class="p">—A tax that takes a larger percentage of income from high-income groups than from low-income groups.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;">♤<span class="s3"> </span><span class="s5">Proportional tax</span><span class="p">—A tax that takes the same percentage of income from all income groups.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;">♤<span class="s3"> </span><span class="s5">Regressive tax</span><span class="p">—A tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;">♤<span class="s3"> </span><span class="s5">Degressive tax </span><span class="p">– The rate of progression in taxation does not increase in the same proportion as the increase in income.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Progressive taxation is the most popular owing to the following reasons:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s2">♤</span><span class="s3"> </span>It leads to <b>equitable </b>and just distribution of burden of taxes as it imposes higher tax burden on the rich</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s2">♤</span><span class="s3"> </span>It helps in <b>reducing inequalities </b>of income and wealth</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s2">♤</span><span class="s3"> </span>These are <b>elastic </b>as revenue of government increases substantially with the increase in tax rate</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><span class="s2">♤</span><span class="s3"> </span>It is <b>productive </b>because increase in income automatically brings in more revenue</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s2">♤</span><span class="s3"> </span>These are <b>economical </b>as the cost of tax collection does not increase with the increase in tax rates</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><a href=" "></a></p> <p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Adequacy <span class="p">means that taxes must provide enough revenue to meet the basic needs of society.

With a transparent tax system, we know who is being taxed, how much they are paying, and what is being done with the money. We also can find out who (in broad terms) pays the tax and who benefits from tax exemptions, deductions, and credits.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administrative ease <span class="p">means that the tax system is not too complicated or costly for either taxpayers or tax collectors. Rules are well known and fairly simple, forms are not too complicated, it is easy to comply voluntarily, the state can tell if taxes are paid on time and correctly, and the state can conduct audits in a fair</span></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and efficient manner. The cost of collecting a tax should be very small in relation to the amount collected.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Note: <span class="p">The </span>Laffer Curve <span class="p">shows the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This graph shows that as the tax rate increases from zero, the amount of tax revenue collected will</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">increase. At point T*, however, increases in the tax rate lead to decreases in the tax revenue collected. Governments would like to be at point T*, because it is the point at which the government collects maximum amount of tax revenue while people continue to work hard. This would theoretically be the point at which potential GDP is maximized.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part199.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part201.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
