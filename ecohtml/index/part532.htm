Major Features of Pre-1991 Industrial Policy</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">a) <b>Protection to Indian Industries</b>: Local industries were given shelter from international competition by introducing partial physical ban on the imports of products and high imports tariffs. Protection from imports encouraged Indian industry to undertake the manufacture of a variety of products. There was a ready market for all these products.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><a href=" "></a></p> <p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">b) <b>Import-Substitution Policy</b>: Government used its import policy for the healthy development of local industries. Barring the first few years after Independence, the country was facing a shortage of foreign exchange, and so to save the scarce foreign exchange, imports-substitution policy was initiated i.e. the Government encouraged the production of imported goods indigenously.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">c) <b>Financial Infrastructure</b>: In order to provide the financial infrastructure necessary for industry, the Government set up a number of development banks. The principal function of a development bank is to provide medium and long-term investments. They have to also play a major role in promoting the growth of enterprise. With this objective, Government established the Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) (1948), Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) (1955), Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) (1964), Industrial Reconstruction Corporation of India (1971), Unit Trust of India (UTI) (1963), and the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">d) <b>Control over Indian Industries</b>: Indian industries were highly regulated through legislations such as Industrial licensing, MRTP Act, 1969 etc. These legislations restricted the production, expansion and pricing of output of almost all kinds of industries in the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">e) <b>Regulations on Foreign Capital under the Foreign Exchange and Regulation Act (FERA)</b>: FERA restricted foreign investment in a company to 40 percent. This ensured that the control in companies with foreign collaboration remained in the hands of Indians. The restrictions were also imposed on technical collaborations and repatriations of foreign exchange by foreign investors.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">f) <b>Encouragement to Small Industries</b>: Government encouraged small-scale industries (SSIs) by providing a number of support measures for its growth. Policy measures addressed the basic requirements of the SSI like credit, marketing, technology, entrepreneurship development, and fiscal, financial and infrastructural support.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">g) <b>Emphasis on Public Sector</b>: The Government made huge investments in providing infrastructure and basic facilities to industries. This was achieved by establishing public sector enterprises in the key sectors such as power generation, capital goods, heavy machineries, banking, tele- communication, etc.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part531.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part533.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
