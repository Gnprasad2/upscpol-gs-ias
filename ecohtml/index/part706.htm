Sagar Mala Project</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The prime objective of the Sagarmala project (Blue Revolution) is to promote port-led direct and indirect development and to provide infrastructure to transport goods to and from ports quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. Therefore, the Sagarmala Project shall, inter alia, aim to develop access to new development regions with intermodal solutions and promotion of the optimum modal split, enhanced connectivity with main economic centres and beyond through expansion of rail, inland waterways, coastal and road services.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is a strategic and customer-oriented initiative of the Government of India to <b>modernize India&#39;s Ports </b>so that port-led development can be augmented and coastlines can be developed to contribute in India&#39;s growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sagarmala Programme is now moving from the conceptualization and planning to the implementation stage. <b>The National Perspective Plan (NPP), </b>for the comprehensive development of India’s coastline and maritime sector, has been prepared and was released at the maiden Maritime India Summit 2016, on 14th April, 2016, by the Hon’ble Prime Minister.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><a href=" "></a></p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As part of Sagarmala, more than 400 projects, at an estimated infrastructure investment of more than Rs. 7 lack crore, have been identified across the areas of port modernization &amp; new port development, port connectivity enhancement, port-linked industrialization and coastal community development. These projects will be implemented by relevant Central Ministries, State Governments, Ports and other agencies primarily through the private or PPP mode.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>Sagarmala Development Company (SDC) </b>was incorporated on 31st August 2016for providing equity support to residual projects under Sagarmala.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Port Modernization &amp; New Port Development-Master Plans have been finalized for the major ports. Based on the same, 142 port capacity expansion projects (total cost: Rs. 91,434 cr.) have been identified for implementation over the next 20 years. Out of this, 30 projects (total cost: Rs. 11,612 cr.) have been proposed for implementation starting FY 2016-17.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Port connectivity enhancement<span class="p">: Indian Port Rail Corporation Limited (IPRCL) has taken up 25 works across 9 major ports. Out of this, 8 works have already been awarded and 5 more are targeted for award in the remaining part of FY 2016-17. Out of 79 road connectivity projects identified under Sagarmala, 45 projects will be done by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and NHAI, including 18 projects under the Bharatmala scheme.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To promote <b>port-led industrialization</b>, 14 Coastal Economic Zones (CEZs) covering all the Maritime States and Union Territories have been proposed. A CEZ is conceptualized as a spatial- economic region which could extend along 300-500 km of coastline and around 200-300 km</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">inland from the coastline. Each CEZ will be aligned to relevant major and non-major ports in the State and is envisaged to tap synergies with the planned industrial corridors.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As part of the <b>coastal community development </b>objective of the Sagarmala Programme, the Ministry of Shipping is taking up a number of initiatives/projects. Notable among them are the coastal community skilling projects and projects for development of marine fisheries sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The projects identified under Sagarmala Programme are expected to mobilize more than Rs. 7 Lakh Cr of infrastructure investment, double the share of domestic waterways (inland &amp; coastal) in the modal mix, generate logistic cost savings of Rs. 35,000-40,000 Cr per annum, boost merchandize exports by USD 110 Billion and enable creation of 1 Cr new jobs, including 40 Lakh direct jobs, in the next 10 years.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part705.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part707.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
