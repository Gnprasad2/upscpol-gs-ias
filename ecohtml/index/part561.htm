According to NSSO, there are about 57.7 million non-corporate business units outside construction sector, mostly unregistered and self-employment units. However, SMEs in India, due to their low scale and poor adoption of technology, have very poor productivity. The total employment in MSME sector is about 80.5 million (4th All India Census for Small Scale Industry), which averages to less than 2 people per firm.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although they employ 40% of India&#39;s workforce, they contribute less than that (~35%) to the GDP. Too many firms stay small, unregistered and un-incorporated in the unorganised sector so that they can avoid taxes and regulations. These firms need to expand, grow and innovate in order to continue to scale up and hire more people to run their operations.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In a journey from a small firm towards a big one, it may face following roadblocks:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><a href=" "></a></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;">♤<span class="s3"> </span><span class="s5">Finance: </span><span class="p">with most of the 57.7 million units unregistered, banks, perhaps rightly, do not finance them.

SMEs is really the backbone of our economy, a very strong tool for poverty alleviation, and empowerment of marginalized segment, therefore there is an urgent need to bring in reforms to this sector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part560.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part562.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
