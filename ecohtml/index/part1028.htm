Livestock contribute over 1/4th to the agricultural GDP and about 5% of the country’s GDP and engage about 9% of the agricultural labor force. The livestock sector has been growing faster than crop sector.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Its growth has special significance for small and marginal farmers, landless laborers and tribals and farmers in rain-fed areas as they are more dependent on livestock for supplementing incomes and generating gainful employment. To elaborate:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">In India, livestock wealth is much more equitably distributed than wealth associated with land.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">About 70 per cent of the livestock market in India is owned by 67 per cent of the small and marginal farmers and by the landless. Thus, growth of the livestock sector would reduce poverty more than growth of the crops sector.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Distribution patterns of income and employment show that rural poverty is less in states where livestock accounts for a sizeable share of agricultural income as well as employment.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">The small ruminants and poultry livestock provide livelihood support to the poor underprivileged landless, and marginal farm households as there upkeep cost is low and are source of milk, eggs and meat.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Rain-fed regions face uncertain and erratic weather conditions which negatively impact crop productivity and wage labor in the agriculture sector. Animals are natural capital, which can be easily reproduced to act as a living bank with offspring as interest, and an insurance against income shocks of crop failure, natural calamities and climate change.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Tribals have community controlled lands which provide them large pastures for their animals. Moreover tribals are still engaged in subsistence agriculture. Thus, livestock is a good source of income and support to them.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the light of immense potential of the sector in providing inclusive economic growth to the rural folks, government has come up with several projects. Yet, the sector has shown a decline in recent years. Following steps can be taken to improve the potential of the sector:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Livestock producers, including traditional pastoralists and smallholders, are both victims of natural resource degradation and contributors to it. Corrective action related to environmental protection, ecosystem services, community led interventions and through incentives for private investment should be taken.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Improving livestock-related technologies for livestock feed, breeding, processing, technical manpower and infrastructure.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Frequent outbreak of diseases and poor productivity should be tackled with improved focus on animal health and outreach of veterinary services.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Development of a better paying markets for livestock and commercialization of livestock.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Livestock sector did not receive the policy and financial attention commensurate to its contribution. Systematic implementation of loans and insurance schemes particularly in remote areas is needed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><a href=" "></a></p> <p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1027.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1029.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
