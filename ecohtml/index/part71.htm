Banking </p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Banks are financial institutions that accept deposits and make loans. Included under the term <i>banks </i>are firms such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, and credit unions. Banks are the financial intermediaries that the average person interacts with most frequently. A person who needs a loan to buy a house or a car usually obtains it from a local bank. Most people keep a large proportion of their financial wealth in banks in the form of savings accounts, or other types of bank deposits. Because banks are the largest financial intermediaries in our economy, they need to be understood well. The following three functions are essential in making a financial institution a bank:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;"><a href=" "></a></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s5">Accept deposits </span><span class="p">- Banks accept deposits from the public at large which are repayable on demand and withdrawable by cheque or otherwise</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s5">Lending </span><span class="p">- Banks uses these deposits for lending to others and undertaking investment in securities.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: +0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s5">Creation of money </span><span class="p">– It is the unique characteristic of commercial banks. Their debts circulate as money in the economy. Banks have the power to destroy and create money through lending activities. Money created by bank is known as deposit money or bank money.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">None of these alone are sufficient to make a financial institution a bank. However, the RBI has in recent times given license for two new types of banks- <b>Payment Banks </b>and <b>Small Finance Banks </b>- as differentiated banks.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part72.htm">2.1.
