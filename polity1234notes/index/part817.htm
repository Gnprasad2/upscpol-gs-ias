Significance of DPSP’s</h3><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The DPSP’s aim to establish an India where the ideals of not only political democracy, but also social and economic democracy have been realized. They provide a broad direction to the ruling regime regardless of its political complexion and hence help in maintaining some consistency in policy direction despite change in governments. DPSP’s have also functioned as beacons to the judiciary. Above all, they have an educative value.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">According to M C Setalvad, the former Attorney General of India, the Directive Principles, although confer no legal rights and creates no legal remedies, are significant and useful in the following ways:</p> <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">a) <span class="p">They are like an ‘Instrument of Instructions’ or general recommendations addressed to all authorities in the Indian Union. They remind them of the basic principles of the new social and economic order, which the Constitution aims at building.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">b) <span class="p">They have served as useful beacon-lights to the courts. They have helped the courts in exercising their power of judicial review, that is, the power to determine the constitutional validity of a law.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">c) <span class="p">They form the dominating background to all State action, legislative or executive and also a guide to the courts in some respects.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">d) <span class="p">They amplify the Preamble, which solemnly resolves to secure to all citizens of India justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">e) <span class="p">They facilitate stability and continuity in domestic and foreign policies in political, economic and social spheres in spite of the changes of the party in power.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">f) <span class="p">They are supplementary to the fundamental rights of the citizens. They are intended to fill in the vacuum in Part III by providing for social and economic rights.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">g) <span class="p">Their implementation creates a favourable atmosphere for the full and proper enjoyment of the fundamental rights by the citizens. Political democracy, without economic democracy, has no meaning.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">h) <span class="p">They enable the opposition to exercise influence and control over the operations of the government. The Opposition can blame the ruling party on the ground that its activities are opposed to the Directives.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">i) <span class="p">They serve as a crucial test for the performance of the government. The people can examine the policies and programmes of the government in the light of these constitutional declarations.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">j) <span class="p">They serve as a common political manifesto. A ruling party, irrespective of its political ideology, has to recognize the fact that these principles are intended to be its guide, philosopher and friend in its legislative and executive acts.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part816.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part818.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
