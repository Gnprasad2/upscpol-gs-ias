Other rights and immunities, such as the power to punish for contempt and the power to regulate its own constitution belong primarily to each House as a collective body, for the protection of its members and the vindication of its own authority and dignity. Fundamentally, however, it is only as a means to the effective discharge of the collective functions of the House that the individual privileges are enjoyed by members.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Legislative privileges are provided so that legislatures can discharge their duties without fear and favor and without external interference. These sections protect the freedom of speech  of parliamentarians and legislators; insulate them against litigation over matters that occur in these houses.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, these sections have been prone to misuse. For e.g. In 2003, the Tamil Nadu assembly Speaker directed the arrest of five journalists for publishing articles critical of the AIADMK government. In 2017, the Karnataka assembly Speaker ordered the imprisonment of two journalists for a year based on recommendations in two separate reports of its privilege committees.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, there is a felt need for codification of these parliamentary privileges because of following reasons:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Too wide powers</span><span class="p">: Our legislators have the power to be the sole judges to decide what their privileges are, what constitutes their breach, and what punishment is to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">be awarded in case of breach. It is too wide a power, which clearly impinges on constitutionalism, i.e. the idea of limited powers.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Increased misuse</span><span class="p">: There have been increasing instances of the misuse of the privileges by legislatures in India. Though constitution makers have left the space for the codification of the privileges, there have been no such steps taken by the parliament thereafter.  This has left vagueness and  ambiguity in the privileges, making them prone to misuse.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Lack of counterparts in other democracies: </span><span class="p">The U.S. House of Representatives has been working smoothly without any penal powers for well over two centuries. Australia too codified privileges in 1987. In fact, the British House has itself broken from the past. Acts and utterances defamatory of Parliament or its members are no more treated as privilege questions.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_400.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Further codification would enhance accountability of legislatures as once the privileges are embodied in the legislature enactment, it would be open to judicial scrutiny and would be tested on the touchstone of its consistency with constitutionalism. Also, the argument that codification of privileges will harm the sovereignty of Parliament does not stand as by sovereignty, we mean ‘popular sovereignty’ and not ‘parliamentary sovereignty’.</p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The constitution review commission headed by Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah had also recommended that privileges should be defined and delimited for the free and independent functioning of the legislatures. Holding freedom of speech  subject to legislative privileges is not in tune with modern notions of human rights. The balance between fundamental rights and parliamentary privilege must be re-examined.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"></p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1237.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1239.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
