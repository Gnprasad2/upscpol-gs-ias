Leader of the Opposition </p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The leader of the largest Opposition party having not less than 1/10th seats of the total strength of the House is recognized as the leader of Opposition in that House. His main function is to provide constructive criticism of the policies of the government and to provide an alternative government. The leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were awarded statutory recognition in 1977. They are also entitled to salary and allowances equivalent to that of a Cabinet Minister. The same functionary in the USA is known as the ‘Minority Leader’.</p> <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Leader of Opposition controversy: <span class="p">A party needs 10 per cent of the strength of the House (55 in the Lok Sabha) to stake claim, and the largest Opposition, the Congress, with 44 seats (2014 Lok Sabha elections) was way short of that number. Although UPA had 60 members, this was of no relevance in appointing Leader of the Opposition. Hence, the Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has refused to recognize leader of Congress party as Leader of Opposition.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Congress demanded an amendment to the relevant laws to allow the single-largest party in the Opposition to send its legislative party leader to attend meetings of key appointment panels. Amendment was made with regard to the appointment of the CVC and also the CBI director but the Lokpal Act was not modified to bring the single-largest Opposition party on board if it did not secure 10 per cent seats in the Lok Sabha.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Congress won 52 seats with UPA at 91, so the current 17th Lok</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sabha doesn’t have a Leader of Opposition as well.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part1104.htm">Arguments in favour of compulsorily appointing Leader of Opposition</a><a class="toc0" href="part1105.htm">Arguments against</a><a class="toc0" href="part1106.htm">Way Forward</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1102.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1104.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
