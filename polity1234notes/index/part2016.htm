Counting of Votes </p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Returning Officer (RO) is responsible for conducting elections in a constituency, which also includes counting of votes. Ideally counting of votes for a constituency is done at one place. However, if a constituency has multiple assembly segments, counting can take place at different locations under the direct supervision of an Assistant Returning Officer (ARO).</p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Counting is performed by counting supervisors appointed by the RO. Counting staff is appointed through a three stage randomisation process to ensure impartiality. Candidates along with their counting agents and election agents are also present in the counting hall.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Counting of votes begins with Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballots (ETPB) and Postal Ballots (PB). These votes are counted under the direct supervision of the RO. In each round of counting, votes from 14 EVMs are counted. In case of simultaneous parliamentary and assembly elections, the first seven tables are used for counting votes for assembly elections, and the rest for parliamentary elections. At the end of each round of counting, the results from 14 EVMs are declared.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 2019, the Supreme Court of India instructed ECI that printed VVPAT slips from randomly selected five polling stations in each assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency should be matched with EVMs. This implies that VVPAT paper slips need to be matched for about 25-50 machines for each parliamentary constituency. This process requires personal supervision of RO/ARO. The ECI has decided that the counting of five VVPATs will be done sequentially.[5] The RO can declare the final result for the constituency after the VVPAT matching process has been completed.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If there is a discrepancy between VVPAT count and EVM results, the printed paper slips count is taken as final. ECI has not clarified whether there would be any further action (such as counting of all VVPATs in a constituency or assembly segment) if there is a discrepancy in the counts of one of the five VVPATs.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part2015.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2017.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
