Some of them include:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Electoral Trusts </span><span class="p">were given legal sanctity in 2013 by bringing them under the Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956. By routing the political contributions through an electoral trust, companies can escape from the dislikes of any political party to which it has not donated.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Income Tax Act </span><span class="p">has been amended to lower the limit for anonymous cash donations from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2,000 to be received by political parties.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_726.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Companies Act </span><span class="p">was amended which removed the cap where corporate entities could contribute only 7.5 per cent of average net profit in the past three financial years.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">Besides, previous requirement to disclose the names of beneficiary political parties in companies’ profit and loss statements was also done away with. These moves were aimed to curb unaccounted money flowing into the political system.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">  ♤       </span><span class="s8"> </span>Finance Act 2017, <span class="p">allows anyone, including corporates, to donate to political parties via electoral bonds</span>.  <span class="p">This measure was taken to “infuse democratic processes with white money” as it aimed at cheque and digital payments ensuring the identity of donors.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Despite these changes, there are many <b>challenges related to transparency in electoral funding. </b>According to Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), more than half of all the income of national parties in India for 2017-18 is derived from <b>unknown sources</b>. Some of these challenges include:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Some of the steps taken by the government are themselves said to be compromising on transparency. For instance:</span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s9">o </span>Schemes like <b>Electoral Bond </b>further promote anonymity.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">Limit for anonymous cash donation is said to be ineffective without a cap on the amount of money that can be collected anonymously through cash</span></p> <p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">  ♤       </span><span class="s8"> </span>Political parties are outside the ambit of RTI despite CIC directive in 2013 to comply with the <b>RTI norms</b>.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">While there is limit on electoral expenditure for each candidate, there is no such capping for party expenditure.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To overcome these challenges, certain committees and commissions such as Inderjit Gupta Committee, Law Commission, 2nd ARC have advocated state funding of elections. It can help promote transparency in electoral funding in the following manner-</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It is argued that state funding of elections will establish a fair playing field for parties with less money.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It will also discourage political parties to source funds from illegitimate means, thus breaking the nexus of </span><span class="s2">business-criminals-politicians.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It will encourage individuals with passion for public service but devoid of financial resources to contest elections.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, there are some concerns regarding state funding of election:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">  ♤       </span><span class="s8"> </span>State funding should not be implemented before functioning and finances of political parties are not made transparent. This is because there is <b>no guarantee </b>that state funding of elections will stop the use of undisclosed additional funds by political parties.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">There is a lack of clarity on distribution of funds. For e.g. if parties are given funds on the basis of vote share in previous elections, then the winning party will always have an unfair advantage over others.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">  ♤       </span><span class="s8"> </span>There is also an argument that there will be <b>misuse of taxpayers’ money </b>on frivolous candidates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_727.png"/></span></p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For making electoral funding truly transparent, reforms are needed not only at candidate level at the time of elections but also in political parties, which need to engage in political activity all through the year, whether there is an election or not. For political parties a starting point could be bringing political parties under RTI as recommended by Central Information Commission (CIC).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s30">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part2174.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2176.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
