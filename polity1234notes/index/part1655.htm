However, post-1990 or post- liberalisation era, various factors led to strengthening of cooperative federalism.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">End of single party rule </span><span class="p">at Centre has diluted the Prime-ministerial form of government.

Thus, less confrontation and more cooperation.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Presidential activism </span><span class="p">- since 1990 onwards successive presidents have become proactive in ensuring constitutionalism and unafraid of using discretionary power in case council of minister misuses constitutional provisions for selfish political reasons</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Judicial activism </span><span class="p">- since 1990 (for ex- S R Bommai case) has ensured that union government don’t misuse constitutional provisions. This has provided a sense of security to state governments.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Implementation of 73th and 74th constitutional amendment </span><span class="p">– has also focused on union, state and local relations unlike union-state relation only earlier.

Further, the forces of liberalization along with Information technology revolution and knowledge revolution are making the diverse and pluricultural society of India even more complex and interdependent.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In fact, we are moving towards competitive federalism where states not only cooperate with centre but also compete with each other for investments and budgetary support based on their performance. Thus, the success of reforms depends on political stability, policy certainty as well as adaptive approach of the governments. It also needs uniform policies between different tiers of governance. This makes the concept of cooperation not optional but necessary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1654.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1656.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
