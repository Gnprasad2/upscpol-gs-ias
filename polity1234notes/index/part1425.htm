Several judges have come under the ambit of all kinds of allegations like corruption, sexual misconduct and favoritism in the appointment of judges. Also the intellectual quality of many judicial pronouncements has been perceived to be mediocre. Cumulatively, this has led to two specific demands.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a) First, there is a need to reform the process of judicial appointments; and</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">b) Second, some mechanism needs to be devised to hold judges accountable. Judicial independence and accountability should go together.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">In India, it is only a collegium of judges that recommends to the President, names for elevation to the bench and there is no outside advice available for this purpose. Judicial pronouncements have made the recommendation binding. The current system of appointments is not open to public scrutiny and thus lacks accountability and transparency.</span></p> <p class="s7" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">A closely related aspect related to accountability of judges is the mechanism for removal of judges for deviant behaviour. Other than impeachment under Articles 124(4) and 217(1), there is no mechanism to proceed against any inappropriate behaviour or misdemeanour of judges. At the time of framing the Constitution, it was felt that judicial conventions and norms would constitute strong checks. However, the impeachment provisions have turned out to be impracticable as it is virtually impossible to initiate any impeachment proceedings, let alone successfully conclude them.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Associated with the above important issues are the need for a cooling off period for judges before taking up government appointments and measures for tackling the problems of judicial backlog.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The recent episodes regarding sexual misconduct, corruption and nepotism clearly indicate that the credibility of judiciary is now at stake. The NJAC appears to be a step in the right direction but what needs to be ensured is that it functions in a transparent and impartial manner. The entire process should ensure that while judiciary is accountable to the public at large, at the same time, it is free from any unwanted interference. This would need some delicate balancing.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1424.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1426.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
