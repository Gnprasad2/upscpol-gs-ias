Rajya Sabha </p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The members of Rajya Sabha are elected indirectly by the elected members of the Legislative Assembly of each state (or an electoral college in case of UTs) by the means of Proportional Representation by single transferable vote. This was done in order to give some representation to minority parties and communities. According to the Supreme Court, Rajya Sabha is not a federal chamber at par with the US Senate. Members do not vote on state lines but on party lines.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>The Rajya Sabha polls have a system of <b>open ballot</b>, but it is a limited form of openness. As a measure to check rampant cross-voting, the system of each party MLA showing his or her marked ballots to the party’s authorised agent, before they are put into the ballot box, has been introduced. The independent candidates are barred from showing their ballots to anyone.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>The None of the Above (<b>NOTA</b>) option doesn’t apply to the Rajya Sabha polls.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>The Supreme Court has ruled that <b>not voting for the party candidate will not attract disqualification under the anti-defection law</b>.
