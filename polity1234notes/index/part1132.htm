Constitution (Amendment) Bills </p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Article 368 of the Indian Constitution lays the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. The Constitution does not provide for a separate Constituent Body to amend the constitution. This power has been vested in the Parliament itself. An amendment of the Constitution may be initiated in either House of the Parliament. This bill can be presented both by the Government or a Private Member. However, in case such a bill is brought by a Private Member, it has to be examined and recommended for introduction in the House by the Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In context of the procedure involving their amendment, there are three categories of articles in the Constitution:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Articles amendable by a Simple Majority</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Artciles that require special majority</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Articles that require Special Majority as well as ratification by legislatures of not less than half of the States of the Indian Union.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a.

Before making such recommendation, the President shall refer the bill to the concerned states for their views within such period as specified by him. However, the President is not bound by the views of the states.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_361.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the Parliament to pass a law providing for the creation or abolition of a Legislative Council in a State, the legislative assembly of the State has to pass a resolution to that effect by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of the assembly present and voting. The Parliament however may approve or disapprove of such resolution or may not take any action on it.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">b.

In the strictest sense, the special majority is required for voting at the third reading stage of the bill. However, exercising abundant caution, the requirement of special majority has been provided for all effective stages of the Bill in the Rules of the Houses.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">c.
