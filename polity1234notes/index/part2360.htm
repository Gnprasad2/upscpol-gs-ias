Evolution of Tribunals </p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The growth of Administrative Tribunals, both in developed and developing countries, has been a significant phenomenon of the twentieth century. In India also, innumerable Tribunals have been set up from time to time, both at the center and the states, covering various areas of activities like trade, industry, banking, taxation etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The question of establishment of Administrative Tribunals to provide speedy and inexpensive relief to the government employees, relating to grievances on recruitment and other conditions of service, had been under the consideration of Government of India for a long time. Due to their heavy preoccupation, long pending and backlog of cases, costs involved and time factors, Judicial Courts could not offer the much-needed remedy to government servants, in their disputes with the government. A need arose to set up an institution, which would help in dispensing prompt relief to harassed employees, who perceive a sense of injustice and lack of fair play in dealing with their service grievances. This would motivate the employees better and raise their morale, which in turn would increase their productivity.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The First ARC and a Committee under J.C.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">Differences between Article 323A and 323B</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s45"> </span><span class="s30">While Article 323 A contemplates establishment of tribunals for public service matters only, Article 323 B contemplates establishment of tribunals for certain other matters such as taxation, foreign exchange, industrial and labour, land reforms etc.</span></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s45"> </span><span class="s30">While tribunals under Article 323 A can be established only by Parliament, tribunals under Article 323 B can be established both by Parliament and state legislatures with respect to matters falling within their legislative competence.</span></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s45"> </span><span class="s30">Under Article 323  A,  only  one  tribunal  for the Centre and one for each state or two or more states may be established.

The same was validated by the Supreme Court in 1980.</p><p class="s137" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">T<span class="p">he 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 added a new Part XIV-A to the Constitution. This part is entitled as ‘Tribunals’ and consists of only two Articles—Article 323 A dealing with administrative tribunals and Article 323 B dealing with tribunals for other matters.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution (Article 323-A) empowered the Parliament to provide for adjudication or trial by Administrative Tribunals of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and constitution of service of persons appointed to public service and posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of any state or local or other authority within the territory of India or under the control of the government or any corporation, owned or controlled by the government.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In pursuance of the provisions of Article 323-A of the Constitution, the Administrative Tribunals Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha and received the assent of the President of India in 1985. The act authorised the Central government to establish one Central Administrative Tribunal and the State Administrative Tribunals.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part2359.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2361.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
