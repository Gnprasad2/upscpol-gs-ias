Statutory Independent Regulatory Agencies</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Regulation by government through its <b>own Departments or Agencies </b>directly under its control has always existed. The last century has seen the emergence of a special category of regulatory systems â€“ the Independent Statutory Regulating Agencies. These agencies differ from the conventional regulating system as they are separated from the executive wing of the government and enjoy a certain degree of autonomy. The concept of independent regulations took birth in USA. The basic premise of the establishment of these agencies being that a market based economy needs to be regulated in order to ensure a level playing field to all and also to safeguard the <b>larger public and national interest</b>. Other factors, which favoured the creation of independent regulators were:</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">i. Increasing complexities and the advancement of technologies required for handling of issues by experts.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">ii. Public interest is best served by insulating decision-making in certain issues, from political interference.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In India, with the initiation of the process of economic liberalization in the early 90s, government withdrew from many activities, which hitherto were monopolized by it. The entry of corporate sector necessitated certain measures <b>to boost the investor competence and to safeguard public interest</b>. One such measure was setting up of independent regulators. In addition, the traditional departmental structure of government was not best suited to play the dual role of a policy making as well as regulating the sector concerned.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part2261.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2263.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
