The accountability of the press depends upon various dynamics and the responsive character of the members of profession and that of the organizations like Press Council of India and Journalists’ associations. If the press is supposed to be a watchdog of the society, the Press Council of India is expected to be the watchdog of the press. It is a forum where people can send the complaints against irresponsible functioning of media and  press persons also can  complain  about the threats to their functional independence.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As the Government’s control over the press would amount to deprivation of freedom of press, a peer group of professionals is ideal to deal with professional aspects of journalism. Thus PCI constituting journalist seeks to self regulate in order to seek highest standards of professional integrity and professionalism in the field of journalism. Thus broadly the mandate of PCI is to first, secure independence of the press and second, making the press accountable.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However over the years, working of PCI has let much to desire. Some of the lacunae in the functioning of PCI have been:</p><p class="s135" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s136"> </span><span class="p">There is a need to give it more powers, teeth to enforce its directions and orders to make it almost like a court of law imposing punishments and penalties. Though it is a court for some purposes it has no power of contempt to secure enforcement of its orders, which is a reasonable demand.</span></p><p class="s135" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s136"> </span><span class="p">Press Council tends to consider itself as complaints councils and insists on mediating and not on adjudicating against the Media, if they can  avoid. On a holistic perspective, the role of Council is not just to satisfy a few individuals or groups who have been hurt by the media; not just to avoid law suits; and not just to discourage the State or limiting the freedom of the Media to make money. The Press Council is meant to improve the Media.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_778.png"/></span></p><p class="s135" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s136"> </span><span class="p">It should also assume functions like reporting on the state and evolution of the media and periodic audit of the Media in terms of its essential functions.</span></p><p class="s135" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s136"> </span><span class="p">The Press Council should take interest in the training of journalists to improve professionalism and take up research on how the media actually functions, what influence it exercises and what citizen need from them.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The Press Council has no role to play in shaping journalistic education and institutional organization unlike the other professional councils such as Bar Council and Medical Council.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">There is a need for bringing the electronic media under the purview of PCI.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The PCI is also plagued by conflict of interest since a majority of their members are media-owners.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">PCI has generally been ineffective in checking problems of paid news in recent elections.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part2343.htm">3. &quot;India lacks an independent nuclear regulatory mechanism with the mandate to ensure high standards of safety and security at civilian nuclear facilities.&quot; In the light of the above statement examine the prevalent nuclear regulatory mechanism in India.
