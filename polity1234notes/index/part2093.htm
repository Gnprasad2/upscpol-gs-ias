While, Section 62(5), is one of the conditions laid down, which has to be looked upon for a person to vote in the election. The Supreme Court had earlier rejected a challenge against the validity of section 62(5) which contended that the section is violative of Article 14, right to equality and Article 21, right to life.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Even if section 65(2) is considered to be valid, it violates the principle of “Innocent until proven guilty”. Under this section, we are placing the people who are accused of an offence under the same category of those who are already convicted and not allowing them to vote.</span></p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>principle of reasonable classification </b>is valid under Article 14 however; such a classification is averse to classifying reasonably. It gives power to a person to strip off other person from is right to vote, by simply accusing him and accounting him to go to jail. Such a rule negates the very concept of citizenship and denies the person of his right to be heard of in forming the government. If section 62(5), is considered to be valid and abiding to all the constitutional principles, then the rationale given by the Hon’ble Supreme Court behind the decision is logically sound.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part2092.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2094.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
