Any public spirited person can move the court for  public cause by filing a  petition  in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution or in the High Court under Article 226 of the constitution or before the Court of Magistrate under sec.133 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 . The traditional requirement of ‘locus standi’ is relaxed in PIL.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To achieve justice in the society, Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has proved to be a useful tool. It provides a means to justice to disadvantaged sections of society and enables civil society to not only spread awareness about human rights and also allows them to participate in government decision making.</p><p class="s86" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s87"> </span><span class="p">The most important contribution of PIL has been to bring courts closer to the disadvantaged sections of society such as prisoners, destitute, child or bonded labourers, women, and scheduled castes/tribes.</span></p><p class="s86" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s87"> </span><span class="p">As Directive Principles are not justiciable, the courts imported some of these principles into the FRs thus making various socio-economic rights as important—at least in theory—as civil and political rights. This resulted in the legal recognition of rights as important as education, health, livelihood, pollution-free environment, privacy and speedy trial.</span></p><p class="s86" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s87"> </span><span class="p">PIL is also an instrument to promote rule of law, demand fairness and transparency, fight corruption in administration, and enhance the overall accountability of the government agencies.</span></p><p class="s86" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s87"> </span><span class="p">Through PIL, judiciary also triggered legislative reforms and filled in legislative gaps in important areas. For instance, the Supreme Court in the Vishaka case laid down detailed guidelines on sexual harassment at the workplace.</span></p><p class="s86" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s87"> </span><span class="p">The Indian judiciary, courtesy of PIL, has helped in ensuring the reservation of seats for SCs/STs and other backwards classes in employment or educational institutions.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ulterior purpose: While PIL has proved to be a useful tool for the marginalized disadvantaged groups, it is being misused by people agitating for private grievances in the grab of public interest and seeking publicity rather than espousing public causes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_468.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Almost any issue is presented to the courts in the guise of public interest because of the allurements that the PIL jurisprudence offers (e.g. inexpensive, quick response, and high  impact). Frivolous PIL plaintiffs waste the time and energy of the courts, the judiciary and add to the burden of increasing backlog.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although the Supreme Court has compiled a set of ‘‘Guidelines to be Followed for Entertaining Letters/Petitions Received by it as PIL’’ it is critical to ensure that PIL does not become a back-door to enter the courts to fulfill private interests, settle political scores or simply to gain easy publicity.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">PIL enables civil society to play an active role in spreading social awareness about human rights, in providing voice to the marginalised sections of society, and in allowing their participation in government decision making. If civil society and disadvantaged groups lose faith in the efficacy of PIL, that would sound a death knell for it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1442.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1444.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
