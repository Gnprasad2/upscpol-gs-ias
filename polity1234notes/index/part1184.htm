Issues concerning Indian Parliament </p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s52">⧫</span><span class="s53"> </span><b>Reduction in the number of sittings: </b>The 16<span class="s68">th </span>Lok Sabha worked for a total number of 1,615 hours, 20% more than the 15<span class="s68">th </span>Lok Sabha. However, this is 40% lower than the average of all full term Lok Sabhas (2,689 hours). Furthermore, there has been a general decline in the number of sitting days. The 16<span class="s68">th </span>Lok Sabha sat for 331 days in comparison with an average of 468 days for previous full term Lok Sabhas.</p><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s53"> </span><span class="s2">Discipline and decorum: </span><span class="p">There have been increased instances of interruptions and disruptions leading sometimes even to adjournment of the proceedings of the House. This, not only, results in the wastage of time of the House but also affects adversely the very purpose of Parliament. The 16th Lok Sabha lost 16% of its scheduled time to disruptions, while in the same period, the Rajya Sabha lost 36% of its scheduled time.</span></p><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s53"> </span><span class="s2">Declining quality of parliamentary debates: </span><span class="p">Parliamentary debates, which once focussed on national and critical issues, are now more about local problems, viewed from a parochial angle.</span></p><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s53"> </span><span class="s2">Low representation of women: </span><span class="p">Although, women’s representation has steadily increased in the Lok Sabha, only 5% of the House in the first-ever election to 14% in the 17th Lok Sabha, this is still inadequate when compared to democracies like U.S. that has 32% and Bangladesh with 21% women members. Of the 543 constituencies in 2019, about half (48.4%) have never voted a woman MP since 1962.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s52">⧫</span><span class="s53"> </span><b>Inadequate Discussion: </b>Bills are being passed with no/minimum discussion and by voice vote amidst pandemonium in the House. In the 16th Lok Sabha, 32% of the Bills were discussed for more than three hours vis-a-vis previous two Lok Sabhas (22% and 14% in the 15<span class="s68">th </span>and 14<span class="s68">th </span>Lok Sabha respectively). It must be highlighted that the bills passed within 30 minutes have decreased significantly from 26% in the 15<span class="s68">th </span>Lok Sabha to 6% in the 16<span class="s68">th </span>Lok Sabha.</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s52">⧫</span><span class="s53"> </span><b>Reduced Scrutiny by Parliamentary Committees: </b>Although more Bills have been discussed for longer, this Lok Sabha has referred a significantly lower proportion of Bills to Committees for scrutiny. In the 16<span class="s68">th </span>Lok Sabha, 25% of the Bills introduced were referred to Committees, much lower than 71% and 60% in the 15<span class="s68">th </span>and 14<span class="s68">th </span>Lok Sabha respectively.</p><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s53"> </span><span class="s2">Legislation through Ordinances: </span><span class="p">The Constitution confers upon the President the power to promulgate an Ordinance at a time when both Houses of the Parliament are not in Session and on  being  satisfied  that circumstances exist rendering  it necessary for  him to take immediate action. However, there has been an over issuance of frequent and large number of Ordinances even when there exist no urgency or exceptional circumstances.</span></p><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s53"> </span><span class="s2">Codifying Parliamentary Privileges: </span><span class="p">Parliamentary privileges have not been codified leading to uncertainty and anxiety over their misuse.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1183.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1185.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
