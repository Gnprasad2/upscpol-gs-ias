A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When people flee their own country and seek sanctuary in another country, they apply for asylum – the right to be recognized as a refugee and receive legal protection and material assistance. An asylum seeker must demonstrate that his or her fear of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">persecution in his or her home country is well-founded. Hence refugee is an asylum seeker whose application has been successful.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although India has provided shelter to one of the largest refugee populations in South Asia, it lacks a uniform asylum policy. India has not signed the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention on the Status of Refugees, or its 1967 Protocol. In contemporary time need of a uniform asylum policy is felt due to following reasons:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Due to absence of a uniform policy the government has to consider requests on case to case basis which is lengthy and time consuming process.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">India seeks to have a seat in permanent seat in UNSC and membership of groups like NSG; For a global leader it is necessary to have a refugee policy in place which will enhance its good will.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_135.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">By having an asylum policy India will be in a better situation to deal with issues like Baluchistan as it would get support from those leaders who fight for Humanitarian cause. This will also help in dealing with Pakistan strategically.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Although existing provisions might serve the need of asylum seeker but compiling them into a uniform law will project a positive picture of the country before international arena.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Since India is one of the largest contributor of troops in UN Peace keeping mission, having a policy for asylum will complement these efforts.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, same time adoption of a uniform asylum policy can create some challenges like:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Borders in South Asia are extremely porous and any conflict can result in a mass movement of people leading to a strain on local infrastructure and resources and also upsetting the demographic balance</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It will be bound by law not to repatriate a single refugee against their will which is sometime necessary to deal with political crisis</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Giving shelter to every refugee may create new problems like human trafficking and drug trafficking and abuse. It will put additional financial and administrative burden on the State.</span></p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India has already faced a surge of refugees and it has dealt the matter well to the large extent possible without any formal policy. The present Citizenship Amendment bill is a step towards making well framed asylum policy but it is still narrow. In this context a lot needs to be done to wider its ambit so that it can cover all asylum related cases comprehensively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part420.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part422.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
