However, it has always remained a contentious issue especially in the matter of promotions in public employment.</p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the <b>Indira Sawhney &amp; Others vs Union of India, 1992 </b>case, the Supreme Court held that the reservation in appointments, under Article 16(4) of the Constitution, do not apply to promotions. However, subsequent to this judgement, a series of constitutional amendments and judicial pronouncements were made, which negated this judgement:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s8"> </span>The 77th Constitution Amendment Act, 1995 <span class="p">inserted Article </span>16(4A)<span class="p">, which enabled the state to make any law regarding reservation in promotions for the SCs and STs. Also, </span>Article 16(4B) <span class="p">provided that reserved promotion posts for SCs and STs that remain unfilled can be carried forward to the subsequent year.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s8"> </span>In the <b>M Nagaraj case</b>, the Supreme Court also upheld the validity of the Parliament’s decision to extend reservations in promotions. However, it introduced three conditions, essentially necessitating the state to:</p><p style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s9">o </span>Provide <b>proof for the backwardness </b>of the class benefitting from the reservation,</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;"><span class="s9">o </span>Provide <b>proof for its inadequate representation </b>in the position/service; and</p><p style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s9">o </span>Show how reservations in promotions would further the <b>administrative efficiency </b>as mandated by Article 335.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, the first condition was rejected in Jarnail Singh vs Lachhmi Narain Gupta case.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s8"> </span>The Nagaraj judgement was further used in <b>BK Pavitra vs Union of India-I </b>case to strike down the legislation passed subsequent to the 85th Constitution Amendment Act, 2001 by the Karnataka assembly in 2002 that provided for <b>consequential seniority</b>.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">The court held that the government had not collected quantifiable data on the three parameters – inadequacy of representation, backwardness and the impact on overall administrative efficiency – before extending reservations in promotions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s8"> </span>However, in the recent Supreme Court judgement in <b>BK Pavitra vs Union of India-II, </b>it upheld the validity of the Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation Act, 2018. The Act gives a one-time promotion to SC/ST employees, and is referred to as a “catch-up” clause.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_217.png"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">The court held that Article 16 (4A) enables the state to provide for reservation in matters of promotion to SC/ST. Further, the opinion regarding the adequacy of representation of the SCs and STs in the state public services is a matter which forms a part of the subjective satisfaction of the state.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The latest 2018 judgement has also examined various associated issues related to reservation in promotion debate such as -</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s8"> </span>Issue of merit and efficiency: <span class="p">The court held that the efficiency of administration must be defined in an inclusive sense, where a </span>‘meritorious’ candidate <span class="p">is not merely one who is ‘talented’ or ‘successful’ but also one whose appointment fulfills the constitutional goals of uplifting members of the SCs and STs and ensuring a diverse and representative administration.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Notion of substantive equality</span><span class="p">: It also held that Indian Constitution envisages not just a formal equality of opportunity but the achievement of substantive equality.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Issue of creamy layer: </span><span class="p">It held that progression in a cadre based on promotion cannot be treated as the acquisition of creamy layer status.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Overall, the judgment asserts that the policy of reservations is a tool to achieve substantive equality and due representation in public services.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part676.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part678.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
