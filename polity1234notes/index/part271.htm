Socialist</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_078.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution had a socialist content in the form of certain Directive Principles of State Policy (esp. Arts. 39(b) and 39(c)), even before the term was added by the 42nd Amendment Act in 1976. However, the ‘socialism’ envisaged by the Indian Constitution is not the usual scheme of State socialism, which involves ‘nationalisation’ of all means of production, and the abolition of private property. Instead, Indian Socialism is ‘democratic Socialism’, influenced by Fabianism. It is a peaceful gradual transformation of the society in participation with the state and not against the state.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Though the word ‘Socialism’ may seem to be vague, our Supreme Court has observed that its principal aim is to eliminate inequality of income and status and standards of life, and to provide a decent standard of life to the working people. The Indian Constitution, therefore, does not seek to abolish private property altogether but seeks to put it under restraints so that it may be used in the interests of the nation, which includes the upliftment of the poor. Instead of a total nationalization of all property and industry, it envisages a ‘mixed economy’, where both private and public sector grow side by side.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, some have argued that the Indian state is deviating from its path of Socialism. The following have been cited as reasons behind this line of argument:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Adoption of neo-liberal economic policy: The new economic policy (1991) of liberalization, privatization and globalization has diluted the socialist credentials of the Indian state.</span></p> <p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">From 1991 onwards, the trend has been away from socialism to privatization. Investment in many public enterprises has been divested in favour of private persons. Many industries and services, which were reserved for the government sector have been thrown open for private enterprise.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Growth, which happened after the reforms of 1990s exacerbated inter-state and intra-state disparities. Further, this growth has been without any meaningful job creation. (Jobless growth)</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The Indian state has failed to end mass poverty</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, it should be noted that these developments have been in keeping with the worldwide trend after the collapse of socialism in the USSR and East European countries. Also, the constitutional obligation to pay compensation to the private owner for State acquisition has been taken away by repealing Art. 31 by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978. Further, the limitations of the neo-liberal economic model are being realized and the ideal of inclusive growth has been brought back into the fold of policy making.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part270.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part272.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
