There is also a provision for appointment of Regional Commissioners by the President in consultation with the Election Commission. Originally, the Commission had only a Chief Election Commissioner. It currently consists of a Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For the first time, two additional Commissioners were appointed on 16thOctober 1989, but they had a very short tenure - till 1stJanuary 1990. Later, on 1stOctober 1993, two additional Election Commissioners were appointed. The concept of multi-member Commission has been in operation since then, with decision making by majority vote.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Chief Election Commissioner and the two other Election Commissioners are appointment by the President and they have equal powers; receive equal salary and allowances, which are similar to those of a Supreme Court judge. The conditions of service and tenure of Election Commissioners and Regional Commissioners should be decided by the President. Currently, they hold office for a term of six years or until the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part2178.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2180.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
