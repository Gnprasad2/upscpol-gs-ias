When the quota exceeds 50% limit, it breaches the equality norm.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s9">o </span>In <b>M. Nagaraj v. Union of India </b>(2006), a Constitution Bench ruled that equality is part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The 50% ceiling is a constitutional requirement without which the structure of equality of opportunity would collapse.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">No under-representation</span><span class="p">: The upper caste is adequately represented in public employment. It is not clear if the government has quantifiable data to show that people from lower income groups are under-represented in its service.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_155.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Problem with the ceiling</span><span class="p">: By fixing income ceiling for eligibility at ₹8 lakh a year — same as the ‘creamy layer’ limit above which OBC candidates become ineligible for reservations — a parity has been created between socially &amp; economically backward classes with limited means.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Definition of EWS and allotment of quota</span><span class="p">: The issue with current definition of EWS is that it is too broad and would include large sections of population. Further, it also puts families below poverty line and the ones with income of 8 lakh/annum in the same category.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">Reservation for SCs/STs and non-creamy layer amongst OBCs has correlation with their respective populations. While there is no such clarity on arriving at the 10% EWS quota.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Challenges in the identification of beneficiaries</span><span class="p">: In a country where taxable population is still very low due to misrepresentation of income, implementing economic eligibility criteria would be a bureaucratic nightmare.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">‘Pandora’s box’ of demands</span><span class="p">: There may be demand from sections of the SCs/STs and OBCs to introduce similar sub-categorization, based on economic criteria, within their respective quotas. It might also fuel demands for new caste-based censuses to expand quota limits based on SC/ST or OBC proportions in the population, or to extend the reservations to private sector jobs. Quota in  promotions may also gain widespread acceptability, both among the public and the judiciary.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Shrinking public sector</span><span class="p">: With steadily shrinking jobs pool in the Central Government, Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and even banks, 10% reservation will not fulfill expectations.</span></p> <p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Anti-Merit</span><span class="p">: In common perception, reservation has also become synonymous with anti- merit. With extension of reservation, this opinion might get further ingrained in public psyche. • Tool of populism: Offering reservations has increasingly become tool for political gains in politics. This affects their credibility as a tool for social justice.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Passage of the Bill</span><span class="p">: The Bill was not circulated ahead of being introduced, it was not examined by a parliamentary committee &amp; there was hardly any time between its introduction and final discussion.</span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pending Bills</p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Women’s Reservation Bill that is being nationally debated since 1996 is also based on the protective provisions of the Article 15.
