Strengths </p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">a. Time Tested System: <span class="p">adherence to rules and established norms: The Government of India has evolved an elaborate structure, rules and procedures for carrying out its functions which have contributed to nation building and the creation of an inclusive state. These have ensured stability both during crises as well as normal times. It has also experimented with several innovative structures in form of empowered commissions, statutory boards, autonomous societies and institutions, especially in the fields related to research, science and technology.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">b. Stability: <span class="p">The structure of Government staffed by the permanent civil servants has provided continuity and stability during the transfer of power from one elected government to the other. This has contributed to the maturing of our democracy.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">c. Commitment to the Constitution â€“ political neutrality: <span class="p">The well laid down rules and procedures of government have upheld the neutrality of the civil services and prevented politicisation of government programmes and services. This has helped in the evolution of institutions based on the principles enshrined in the constitution.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">d. Link between policy making and its implementation: <span class="p">The framework of the Government of India has facilitated a staffing pattern which promotes a link between policy making and implementation. This has also helped the structure of both the Government of India and the states and promoted the concept of cooperative federalism.</span></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">e. <span class="p">A national outlook amongst the public functionaries: Public servants working in Government of India as well as its attached and subordinate offices have developed a national outlook transcending parochial boundaries. This has contributed to strengthening national integration.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1028.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1030.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
