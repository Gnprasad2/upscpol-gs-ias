Providing the framework for &quot;localized emergency&quot; would ensure that the State Government can continue to function and the Assembly would not have to be dissolved while providing a mechanism to let the Central Government respond to the issue specifically and locally. The imposition of local emergency is fully justified under the mandate of Article 355 read with Entry 2A of List I that is deployment of any armed forces of the union in any state in aid of the civil power and Entry 1 of List II that is public order of the Seventh Schedule. It is submitted that Art. 355 not only imposes a duty on the Union but also grants it, by necessary implication, the power of doing all such acts and employing such means as are reasonably necessary for the effective performance of that duty.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is however necessary that a legal framework for exercising the power of &quot;localized emergency&quot; is provided by an independent Statute borrowing the model of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the <b>Prevention of Communal Violence and Rehabilitation Bill, 2006</b>. Only exceptional situations which fall within the scope of &quot;external aggression&quot; or &quot;internal disturbance&quot; should be considered for the purposes of separate legislation under the mandate of Article 355. Such situations include (a) separatist and such other violence which threatens the sovereignty and integrity of India, (b) communal or sectarian violence of a nature which threatens the secular fabric of the country, and (c) natural or man-made disasters of such dimensions which are beyond the capacity of the State to cope with. With regard to item (c) a Statute is already in place (Disaster Management Act, 2005) and in respect of situations contemplated in item (b), it is learnt that a revised Bill is being proposed. What is therefore required is a legislation to provide for Centreâ€™s role in case of separatist and related violence in a State which is in the nature of &quot;external aggression&quot; or &quot;internal disturbance&quot; contemplated in Article 355.  It is  important that the legislation provides for  appropriate administrative co- ordination between the Union and the State concerned. It may also need consequent amendments to certain sections of the Criminal Procedure Code as well.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1581.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1583.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
