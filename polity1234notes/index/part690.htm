In fact, it also mandates private schools to admit at least 25% of the children without any fee. The Act seeks to promote child-friendly school through measures such as compliance with infrastructure and teacher norms for an effective learning environment.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Section 30(1) of the Act introduced that a child cannot be detained in any class till the completion of elementary education to prevent damage to their self-esteem, increased dropouts and increased social problems like begging and petty crimes. It was aimed at increasing Gross Enrolment Ratio.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_222.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, recently, the Lok Sabha has passed an amendment bill to abolish the No- Detention policy. Two committees of Geeta Bhukkal and TSR Subramaniam also recommended it to be removed in a phased manner. Issues with this policy are:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s8"> </span>It leads to a situation where there remain <b>no incentives for children to learn and for teachers to teach</b>. This leads to students lacking required educational competence, knowledge and skills relevant to higher classes. For e.g. the number of students failing in class 9 examination has been on an increase in many States.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s8"> </span>It <b>affects the quality of classroom teaching </b>as well because at higher levels, teacher is unable to teach the curriculum at an expected pace due to promotion of all students with difference in capabilities and understanding.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It also affects teachers’ ability to control students as teacher loses leverage over students and many government schools turn into mere &quot;mid-day meal&quot; providers.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"></span><span class="s8"> </span>Fall in learning outcomes and automatic promotion of children <b>only rolls over and postpones the problem of dropouts </b>as seen from shoot up of dropouts in class 8 at the end of elementary stage.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In this context, the no-detention policy is being scrapped. At the same time, there are equally strong arguments against the scrapping of the no-detention policy:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">This will mean that the State is blaming students (many of whom are first- generation learners) for their failure to learn in class.</span></p> <p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The RTE Act made a range of other promises such as upgrading quality of teaching, regular assessment through Continous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE). All these along with no-detention policy had to go hand in hand. No-detention policy does not mean no evaluation.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Further, bringing back the old pass-fail system without making proper course correction in other areas may undermine the egalitarian promise of the RTE.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To conclude, detention should be resorted to only after giving the child remedial coaching and extra chances to prove his capability. Education should be inclusive and should have a common curriculum, so that all children become familiar with the basic concepts, tenets, principles and ethos of the Indian education.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part689.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part691.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
