Evolution and Structure</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fast Track Courts were initially established for a period of five years (2000-2005). The 11thFinance Commission recommended for establishment of 1734 FTCs for expeditious disposal of cases pending in lower courts. FTCs were established by state governments in consultation</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">with respective high courts. Judges of these FTCs were appointed on an adhoc basis and they were selected by the High Court of respective states.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are primarily three sources of recruitment:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">by promoting members from amongst the eligible judicial officers;</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">by appointing retired high court judges and</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">recruited from amongst the member of bar of the respected state.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The cases are heard on a daily basis and no adjournments are allowed in the fast track courts. The cases are disposed within a given time frame.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_484.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In 2005, the Supreme Court directed the central government to continue with the FTC scheme, which was extended until 2010-2011. Subsequently, the government discontinued the FTC scheme in March 2011 due to financial problems and stopped financing FTCs. But as state governments enjoyed liberty to continue if they want, some states like Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala decided to continue with FTCs, while Haryana and Chhattisgarh discontinued. Some states like Delhi and Karnataka extended for a limited period of time. After the Delhi Rape Case, High Court of Delhi directed the state government to establish FTCs for the expeditious adjudication of cases relating to sexual assault. Some other states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have also begun the process of establishing FTCs for rape cases.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5.2. Challenges</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FTCs were established for speeding up long pending trials. However, success rate of FTCs in disposing of pending criminal cases is a mixed one. Southern states, along with Gujarat and Maharashtra have succeeded in making good use of FTCs. Bihar and UP, which account for 40% of all pending criminal cases have not succeeded much. Further, FTCs are accused of speeding up the trial so fast that they look like summary trials where enough opportunity is not given to the defender to present the case. Therefore, it is said that in fast track court justice is hurried that is equivalent to justice buried. The lack of mechanisms of judicial accountability for retired judges is another issue, which needs to be tackled for effectiveness of FTCs<span class="s20">.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1494.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1496.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
