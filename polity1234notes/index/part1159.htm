Role of Rajya Sabha </p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">i) Revising Chamber: <span class="p">Rajya Sabha has a special role to play as a revising Chamber. Though there have not been many revisions, yet there is always a possibility of revision as a result of second sober thought. In our parliamentary system, Rajya Sabha has the authority to discuss and reasonably delay legislation. As a Second Chamber, it has the mandate to secure a second sober look at hasty legislation.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_368.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">ii) Federal Chamber: <span class="p">Another significant role of the Rajya Sabha was guided by the need for giving  representation  to the states in  the federal  legislature. Rajya  Sabha  is a  federal Chamber where the representatives of each state are elected by the elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the state. As a federal Chamber, it has been assigned some special powers, impacting federal interests. The Rajya Sabha being the representative forum of the States endeavors to remain ever concerned and sensitive to the aspirations of the states. In the process, it strengthens the countryâ€™s federal fabric and promotes national integration.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">iii) Deliberative Chamber: <span class="p">The prime role of the Rajya Sabha as a deliberative Chamber has been reinforced by the provision of nomination to the Rajya Sabha of 12 Members noted for their contribution to literature, science, art and social service. The high traditions of debates and discussions in the House have guided the Members of Rajya Sabha not only to hold informed debates on public issues but also to endeavor to make proceedings relevant to public welfare.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">iv) Chamber of Continuity: <span class="p">Rajya Sabha is a permanent Chamber, not subject to dissolution and one-third of its Members retire every second year. The hallmark of the Rajya Sabha is the principle of continuity as a perpetual House and as a continuous institution in the parliamentary framework. A scheme of having a Chamber of legislative continuity was needed in a parliamentary system to meet the legislative and constitutional contingency at a time when the popularly elected House may be under dissolution or in the process of reconstitution after election. A Bill which is pending in the Rajya Sabha and has not been passed by the Lok Sabha, will not lapse on the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. Thus, the continuity of the Rajya Sabha ensures a significant measure of legislative continuity.</span></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">v) Chamber not concerned with Government formation: <span class="p">The Government of the day is collectively responsible to the House of People, the directly elected House. Rajya Sabha being an indirectly elected House has no role in the making or unmaking of the Government. Since the Governments are not formed, nor do they fall on the basis of the numerical strength of the Rajya Sabha, this Chamber is relatively free from the compulsions of competitive party politics. While it is often argued that since Rajya Sabha cannot bring down a Government, its role is limited in a political perspective. Nevertheless, the Rajya Sabha has played a significant role in contributing to the national discourse in full measure.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">vi) Effective Smaller Chamber: <span class="p">Rajya Sabha is comparatively a smaller Chamber than the Lok Sabha given its maximum strength is lesser than the Lok Sabha. Being a smaller House, it affords opportunities for close camaraderie and greater consensus-building among the Members. Spirit of accommodation and adjustment among the Members, across party lines, contribute to the effectiveness of this House. It also helps in better time management of the House, besides discussions on wide ranging issues.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">vii) Chamber Securing Executive Accountability: <span class="p">Rajya Sabha, as a constituent part of Parliament, has been securing executive accountability through its various committees. At present, there are 24 Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committees in the Parliament, out of which eight are functioning under the direction and control of the Chairman, Rajya Sabha. The constructive criticism and considered recommendations made by such Committees have been found to be useful by the Ministries and Departments concerned to tone up their functioning and to formulate realistic budgets, plans and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">programs for the welfare of the people. These Committees have considered some of the important legislations and presented reports thereon to both Houses of Parliament.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">viii) Chamber of Ventilating Public Grievances: <span class="p">Rajya Sabha reflects the problems faced by different states. Its Members, being the representatives of states, articulate the concerns of respective states and their people. Through procedural devices such as Questions, Calling Attention, Special Mentions, Short Duration Discussion, Half-an-Hour Discussion, Motions, Resolutions, etc., it has raised issues of public importance, focused attention on matters affecting policies of the Government and provided a forum for ventilation of public grievances. Through these devices, it has managed not only to elicit information but also put pressure on the Government to reorient its policies for serving larger public interests.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1158.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1160.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
