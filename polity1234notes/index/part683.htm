They kept providing instant news update which kept the terrorist and their cross border handlers informed and updated about the security operation and put many lives at risk.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">About the role of media Supreme Court observed that it is not possible to find out whether the security forces actually suffered any casualty or injuries on account of the way their operations were being displayed on the TV screen. But it is beyond doubt that the way their operations were freely shown made the task of the security forces not only exceedingly difficult but also dangerous and risky.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Any attempt to justify the conduct of the TV channels by citing the right to freedom of speech and expression would be totally wrong and unacceptable in such a situation as national security when many lives are at risk cannot be hold hostage to the claim of a</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">right which is being misused. The visuals that were shown live by the TV channels could have also been shown after all the terrorists were neutralized. But, in that case the TV programmes would not have had the same shrill, scintillating and chilling effect and would not have shot up the TRP ratings of the channels. It must, therefore, be held that by covering live the terrorists attack on Mumbai in the way it was done, the Indian TV channels were not serving any national interest or social cause. On the contrary they were acting in their own commercial interests putting the national security in jeopardy.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are still no regulations in place by the government regarding coverage of news live which could compromise national interest. But then, do we need to wait for a regulation? When it comes to national interest, you don&#39;t wait for a regulation, you just act responsibly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_220.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Principles: <span class="p">There can be some principles which media should keep in mind while covering an incident which affects national security or can result in loss of life; such as:</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Human life must be given utmost importance, media should over look TRP and commercial interest when human life is at stake.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">National security must never be compromised in name of freedom of speech and expression.
