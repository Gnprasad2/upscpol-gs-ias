Service Rules were amended so as to give weightage to the training and penalize failure. On a challenge being laid to the constitutionality of the amendment in the Rules in Mohan Kumar Singhania &amp; Ors. Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors., (1992), in order to uphold the validity of the amendment, Ratnavel Pandian, J. drew strength from article 51A.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Referring to clause (j), which commands every citizen of India to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement, it was held that the effort taken by the Government in giving utmost importance to the training programme of the selectees so that this higher civil service being the topmost service of the country is not wasted and does not become fruitless during the training period is in consonance with the provisions of article 51A (j). The constitutionality of the amendment was, thus, upheld.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra &amp; Ors.

Article 21, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duty clause (g) of article 51A were relied on by the Supreme Court for spelling out a clear mandate to the State to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country. The court held it mandatory for the State Government to anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environment degradation.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Bijoe Emmanuel vs State of Kerala, AIR 1987: </span><span class="p">In this case, it has been held that there is no provision of law which obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem nor is it disrespectful to the National Anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung does not join the singing.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing. It was observed that there was no law enacted by Parliament making it obligatory to comply with article 51A(a).
