This obligation is coupled with the power to enforce that duty, if necessary without any request coming from the State. This is consistent with the federal scheme of the Constitution. A whole range of action on the part of the Union is possible under this power depending on the circumstances of the case as well as the nature, timing and the gravity of the internal disturbance. The Union can advise the State on the most appropriate deployment of its resources to contain the problem. In more serious situations, augmentation of the States&#39; own efforts by rendering Union assistance in men, material and finance may become necessary. If it is a violent or prolonged upheaval (not amounting to a grave emergency under Art. 352), deployment of the Union forces in aid of the police and magistracy of the State may be adopted to deal with the problem. Action to be taken may include measures to prevent recurring crisis.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When a situation of public disorder aggravate into an internal disturbance as envisaged in Art. 355, justifying Union intervention is a matter that has been left by the Constitution to the judgement and good sense of the Union Government. Though this is the legal position, in practice, it is advisable for the Union Government to <b>sound the State Government and seek its co-operation before deploying its Forces in a State.</b></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">S.R.
