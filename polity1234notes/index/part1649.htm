NITI Aayog fosters this development through coordination, competition, advice and dissemination of best practices. Further, it has the potential to metamorphose into an organization, which can transform implementation of policy through reforms and play a more meaningful role in shaping the country&#39;s future.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part1650.htm">14.
