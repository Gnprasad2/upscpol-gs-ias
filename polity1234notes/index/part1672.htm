The Lord Chancellor also had certain other judicial positions, including being a judge in the Court of Appeal and President of the Chancery Division. The Lord Chancellor combines other aspects of the Constitution, including having certain priestly functions of the established state church, making certain church appointments, nominations and sitting as one of the thirty-three Church Commissioners.
