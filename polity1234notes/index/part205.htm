The Act had retained control of the Central Government over the Provinces in a certain sphere – by requiring the Governor to act ‘in his discretion’ or in the exercise of his ‘individual judgment’ in certain matters. In such matters the Governor was to act without ministerial advice and under the control and directions of the Viceroy, and, through him, of the Secretary of State.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The legislative powers of both the Central and Provincial Legislatures were subject to various limitations and neither could be said to have possessed the features of a sovereign Legislature. Consider, for instance, the following:</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">Apart from the Viceroy’s power of veto, a Bill passed by the Central Legislature was</span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">also subject to veto by the Crown.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">The Viceroy might prevent discussion in the Legislature and suspend the proceedings in regard to any Bill if he was satisfied that it would affect the discharge of his ‘special responsibilities’.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">Apart from the power to promulgate Ordinances during the recess of the Legislature, the Viceroy had independent powers of legislation, concurrently with those of the Legislature. Thus, he had the power to make temporary Ordinances as well as permanent Acts at any time for the discharge of his special responsibilities.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_056.png"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">No bill or amendment could be introduced in the Legislature without the Viceroy’s previous sanction, with respect to certain matters, e.g., if the Bill or amendment sought to repeal or amend or was repugnant to any law of the British Parliament extending to India or any Viceroy’s or Governor’s Act, or if it sought to affect matters as respects which the Viceroy was required to act in his discretion.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There were similar restraints on the Provincial Legislature.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Instruments of Instructions issued under the Act further required that Bills relating to a number of subjects, such as those derogating from the powers of a High Court or affecting the Permanent Settlement, when presented to the Viceroy or a Governor for his assent, were to be reserved for the consideration of the Crown or the Viceroy, as the case might be.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part204.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part206.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
