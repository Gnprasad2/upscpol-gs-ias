At one time, there were 52 GoMs and EGoMs during the UPA regime, most of which were headed by Mr. Pranab Mukherjee (now the President of India). In all, the UPA government instituted a total of 82 GoMs and 14 EGoMs during its 10-year rule. This process not only led to delay in decision-making on critical policy issues, but went against its own mandate of policy coordination.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, their selective but effective use, with clear mandate and prescribed time limit, can be helpful in resolving the policy deadlock and improving the governance system. As observed by 2nd ARC, there is a need to ensure that existing issues, which requires inter-ministerial coordination be first placed before the Committee of Secretaries (CoS) and then presented to the Union Cabinet for resolution.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The dismantling of the GoMs and EGoMs by the incumbent government is expected to fast track governance, with Ministers and Officers being asked to take decisions directly on pending matters without referring to the cabinet, and if need arises, then with the help of Cabinet Secretariat of PMO’s assistance.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part954.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part956.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
