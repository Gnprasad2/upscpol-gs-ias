Presently only 11 states have taken steps to notify Gram Nyayalayas .Only 208 Gram Nyayalayas are functioning in the country. In some of the States, they are not functioning despite being notified. Very few States have shown eagerness to establish the Gram Nyayalayas and not a single Gram Nyayalaya has become operational in North- Eastern States. Further, they are also grappling with various issues:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Overlapping jurisdiction</span><span class="p">: Majority of states have set up regular courts at the taluk level instead of setting up Gram Nyayalayas as per the 2008 Act. Further, there is ambiguity regarding the specific jurisdiction of Gram Nyayalayas, due to the existence of alternative forums such as family courts etc.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Shortage of human resources</span><span class="p">: The progress is affected by non-availability of judicial officers to function as Gram Nyayadhikaris, notaries, stamp vendors etc. Further, other infrastructure is also grossly inadequate.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Funds</span><span class="p">: The slow pace of utilisation of funds under the Scheme is mainly due to the lack of proposals from the States for setting up of Gram Nyayalayas. While some states were facing problems like inadequate amount of funds allocation and the acquisition of land for the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_587.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Functioning</span><span class="p">: Gram Nyayalayas have been established on a part-time basis (weekly once or twice) and are not in addition to the existing courts. However, in reality, these courts are held only once or twice a month and in certain cases, the frequency is even worse.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Functionaries</span><span class="p">: In the absence of a separate cadre of Gram Nyayadhikari, the Gram Nyayalayas are presided over by First Class Judicial Magistrates or Civil Judges or in a few cases Chief Judicial Magistrates who are already over-burdened with their regular judicial work.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Lack of awareness</span><span class="p">: Many of the stakeholders including the litigants, lawyers, police officers and others are not even aware about the existence of Gram Nyayalayas in the district court premises and no substantial efforts regarding awareness have been taken.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Low case disposal rate</span><span class="p">: One of the objectives of the Act was to reduce pendency and burden on lower courts in the district but the study revealed that even this has not been fulfilled. The number of cases disposed by Gram Nyayalayas is negligible and that they do not make any substantial difference in the overall pendency in the subordinate courts.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Security issues</span><span class="p">: There has been lack of cooperation from lawyers and Public Prosecutors due to the lack of economic viability or incentives/allowance, security issues, unsafe location of a Gram Nyayalaya (sometimes being close to a forest, where crime rates are high), etc.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some Measures that can be taken to improve the efficiency and functioning of Gram Nyayalaya are:</p> <p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Training of Gram Nyayadhikari </span><span class="p">The infrastructure and security are grossly inadequate.to increase awareness regarding legal and procedural requirements of Gram Nyayalayas.
