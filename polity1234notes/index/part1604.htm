Federalism and Foreign Policy</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even though foreign policy is the prerogative of the Central government and the Constitution does not allow the states to take initiatives in these matters, the West Bengal Government challenged the Central Foreign policy on sharing the waters of river Teesta by stalling the bilateral treaty with Bangladesh. Some of the states have been arguing in favour of a role for the states in the foreign policy of the country, particularly, states with an international border are vocal on issues, which directly or indirectly impact them. Similarly, when the issue of border</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">trade with China came up for discussion, Sikkim’s views were sought. Tamil Nadu has demanded the intervention on the issue of Tamil killings in Sri Lanka every now and then. The north-eastern States of the country have borders with various countries like Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, Bhutan and Nepal and their proximity of countries east of India demands that their economies should benefit more from the Look East Policy. North Eastern State leaders have been asserting that their views should be sought while conducting negotiations with neighbouring countries on economic and political issues.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_530.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is a case for institutionalising the process of consultation and involvement of States, which are affected by a particular foreign or security policy measure. Barring Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, all Indian States share borders with other countries, or with the international waters of the sea. In that sense, they have interests or issues that may intersect with the foreign and security policies of the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Among the various governmental systems, the U.S. is one in which the interests of its federal constituents are taken into account in the formulation and exercise of foreign and security policies. This was part of the large and small States compromise that resulted in its constitution. This enables its Upper Chamber, the Senate, to be the lead house on foreign policy issues — ratifying international agreements, approving appointments of envoys and so on. The Senate, as is well known, has a membership which is not based on population — each State, large and small, populous or otherwise, has the same number of Senators.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It would be difficult to graft something like the U.S. system on to the Indian system. Yet, clearly the time has come when Mizoram and Nagaland also have a say in India’s Myanmar policy, instead of merely having to bear its consequences.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1603.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1605.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
