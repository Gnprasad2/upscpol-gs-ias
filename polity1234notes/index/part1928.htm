The decision, when challenged in the Supreme Court resulted in the Governor drawing the ire of the Court for not discharging constitutional duties with a sense of impartiality. As per the Court, there were hidden political motives in this particular action, so as to prevent the formation of government by a particular party. When the Governor justified his actions on basis of fear of defection the court asserted that it is the Speaker’s duty to prevent defection, while the Governor’s duty is limited to swear in the party with majority.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1927.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1929.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
