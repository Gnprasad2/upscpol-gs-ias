Issue of reservation in promotions</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Although, the SC in <b>Indira Sawhney Case </b>had held that the reservation policy cannot be extended to promotions, but it was overruled by the <b>77th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1995. </b>This amendment introduced <b>Article 16(4A)</b>, which provided reservation in promotion to SC/STs.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>In <b>Ajit Singh vs. State of Punjab</b>, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of 77th amendment act and directed to introduce “<b>catch  up  rule</b>”<b>. </b>The court restored their seniority once promoted at par with the SC/ST candidates who got quick promotions ahead of their batch mates.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>The Parliament again amended the Constitution through the <b>85th Amendment Act, 2001, </b>to negate the catch up rule directed by Supreme Court. It introduced <b>promotion with consequential seniority. </b>This act was brought with retrospective effect from 1995.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="s2">Consequential Seniority </span><span class="p">means elevation to a senior position consequential to circumstances, and not through normal rules. Illustrating it, suppose there are 100 sanctioned posts in a department, out of which 30 are occupied by unreserved candidates, 15 are occupied by reserved candidates and 55 remain ‘vacant’. The reservation is 30%, which implies that 30 posts must be manned by reserved category employees. So, if a reserved category employee is junior to a general category employee, but there is vacancy for reserved category at a senior position, so reserved category employee will be considered senior and promoted above the general category employee.</span></p> <p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>In 2002, Karnataka had brought a similar law, but was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2006 in <b>M. Nagaraj vs. Union of India Case</b>. The Supreme Court validated the state’s decision to extend reservation in promotion for SCs and STs, but gave direction that the state should provide proof on the following three parameters to it-</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">o <span class="s2">Empirical Data on Backwardness</span><span class="p">- of the class benefitting from the reservation.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="s2">Empirical Data on Inadequate Representation</span><span class="p">- in the position/service for which reservation in promotion is to be granted.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="s2">Impact on efficiency</span><span class="p">- how reservations in promotions would further administrative efficiency.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>Many stakeholders and petitioners were not satisfied with these criteria and various review petitions were filed on this judgment. It was again taken up in <b>Jarnail Singh Case </b>which upheld the 2nd and 3rd criteria of Nagaraj Case. But observed that there is no longer need to collect quantifiable data on the backwardness of SCs and STs. Although it stated that the <b>exclusion of creamy layer </b>while applying the principle of reservation is justified, even in the case of SCs and STs.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Faculty Association of AIIMS vs. Union of India, July 2013</span><span class="p">- In this case, a five judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled that there are certain jobs for which merit alone should be the sole criteria.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">The Union Government appealed against this judgment and in the review petition a five-judge bench in January 2014, threw the ball back into the Central Government’s</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">court saying that the Government was free to amend the Constitution to provide reservation in faculty for superspeciality posts and that the previous judgment did not place any restriction on the Government to decide whether or not there should be reservation in superspeciality posts.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">In 2019, the Supreme Court had permitted the Central government for reservation in</span></p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">promotion to SC/ST employees working in the public sector in “accordance with law”.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The Karnataka government set up the Ratna Prabha Committee to submit a report on the three criteria and based on its report had come up with the revised bill.
