Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru took great efforts to keep the Chief Ministers of all the states apprised of the activities at the Centre. He wrote to each of them to keep them informed of the state of nation  and to  build  a  consensus on national  issues. This smooth  phase of  Indian federalism was helped by the reason that a single party ruled in almost all the states and at the Centre.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But after the <b>1967 election</b>, the Congress Party was defeated in nine states and its position at the Centre became weak. Thus, a new era in Centre-State relations started. The non-Congress governments in the States opposed the increasing centralization and intervention of the Central government. They raised the issue of State autonomy and demanded more powers and financial resources for the States. This caused tensions and conflicts in Centre-State relations over various issues e.g. mode of appointment and dismissal of Governor, discriminatory and partisan role of Governors, impositions of President’s rule for partisan interests, deployment of central forces in the States to maintain law and order, reservation of State bills for consideration of the President, sharing of finances (between Centre and States), encroachment by the Centre on the State list and so on.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With the prolonged period of coalition governments at the Centre, the third phase in federalization of Indian politics started in the <b>late 1980’s</b>. Regional parties such as the DMK or the RJD have asserted their interests more openly over last one and a half decade of Indian polity. Such assertiveness has resulted in the national parties giving more importance to the role of regional parties in country’s functioning. Despite the increasing stature of regional parties there have been several issues and flashpoints between the Centre and the State. These issues have been under consideration and following developments can be seen in this direction:</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.4.1. Administrative Reform Commission (First)</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Central government appointed a six member Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) in 1966 under the Chairmanship of Morarji Desai. Its terms of references included, among others, the examination of Centre-State relations. In 1969, ARC submitted 22 recommendations in its report on Centre-State relationship. The important recommendations are:</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a) Establishment of Inter-State Council under Article 263 of the Constitution.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">b) Appointment of people having long experience in public life and administration and non-partisan attitude as Governors.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">c) Delegation of powers to the maximum extent to the States.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">d) Transferring of more financial resources to the States to reduce their dependency upon the Centre.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_513.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;">e) Deployment of Central armed forces in States, either on their request or otherwise. But, no action was taken by the Central Government on the recommendations of ARC.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Next, important development in this direction was appointment of Sarkaria Commission.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1569.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1571.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
