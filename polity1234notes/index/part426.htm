Concept of Rights</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rights are entitlements to perform or not to perform certain actions, OR to be or not to be in certain states; OR entitlements that others perform or not perform certain actions OR to be or not to be in certain states.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The modern understanding of what actions are permissible and which institutions are just, are dominated by the discourse on rights. Rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality. By accepting a set of rights, one approves a distribution of freedom and authority, and also endorses a certain view around what may, must, and must not be done.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rights acquire meaning only in context of a society. Each society makes certain rules to regulate the conduct of its constituents. These rules inform its constituents about what is right and what is not. The things that are recognized by the society as rightful become the basis of rights. This is why the notion of rights changes over a period of time and varies from one society to another.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is only when the socially recognized claims are written into a law, that they acquire real force. In absence of this, they merely remain what are called natural or moral rights. When laws recognize some claim, they become enforceable and their enforcement can then be demanded. When fellow citizens, institutions or the government do not respect these rights, it is referred to as the violation or infringement of our rights. In such circumstances, citizens can approach courts to protect their rights. Thus, rights can be defined as the <b>reasonable claims of persons recognized by society and sanctioned by law</b>.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part425.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part427.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
