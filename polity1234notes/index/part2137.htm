However, SC struck down the election since Representation of People Act, 1951, and Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, did not allow use of EVMs. Following this, the RPA 1951 was amended in 1988 to allow usage of EVMs. In 1999, they were used for the first time in the entire state for Goa Legislative Assembly elections. In 2004, EVMs were used for the first time in Lok Sabha elections.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Recently, there have been controversies surrounding EVMs regarding their safety feature. Following arguments were raised against their use:</p> <p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s2">Transparency</span><span class="p">: An electronic display of the voter’s selection may not be the same as the vote stored electronically in the machine’s memory. To bridge this gap, VVPATs were introduced. However, EC’s VVPAT auditing is restricted to one randomly chosen polling booth per constituency, which will fail to detect faulty EVMs 98%-99% of the time.</span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s2">Verifiability: </span><span class="p">It is argued that only the vote number can be verified and not the voting choice.</span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s2">Secrecy: </span><span class="p">With the paper ballot, the EC could mix ballot papers from different booths before counting, so that voting preferences could not be connected to a locality. Counting in EVMs is equivalent to booth-wise counting, which allows one to discern voting patterns &amp; renders marginalized communities vulnerable to pressure.</span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s2">Possibility of hacking: </span><span class="p">Accusations of EVMs getting hacked or even the possibility of them being hacked creates a mistrust about electoral processes in the minds of the public.</span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s2">Malfunctioning EVMs: </span><span class="p">Though provided with specific training for correct usage of EVMs, officers sometimes don&#39;t pay attention &amp; connect machines in wrong order.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, the ECI has time and again upheld the rationale behind the use of EVM’s and argued against going back to ballot papers. Following safety features within the EVM’s make them safe to use:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Non-reprogrammable: </span><span class="p">It consists of an integrated circuit (IC) chip that is one time programmable (software burnt at the time of manufacturing) and cannot be reprogrammed.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">No external communication: </span><span class="p">EVMs are not networked by any wired or wireless system, nor do they have any frequency receiver and data decoder, so there cannot be any external communication. Control Unit (CU) accepts only specially encrypted &amp; dynamically coded data from Ballot Unit (BU).</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Other countries like Netherlands and Germany (which discontinued the use of EVMs) use computer based EVMs which are prone to hacking, while Indian EVMs are standalone machines.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Secure Source Code: </span><span class="p">Software and source code developed in-house by selected group of engineers in BEL and ECIL.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">One Vote per Elector: </span><span class="p">It allows a voter to cast the vote only once.

In 2017, EC even held an ‘EVM Challenge’, where it invited political parties to demonstrate/proof any allegations of tampering. However, cost and efficiency considerations are secondary to the integrity of the election. EC must ensure that any unjustified suspicion in the minds of public is removed through:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• 100% deployment of VVPAT in all elections and by-polls and on detection of any faulty EVM in a constituency must entail the VVPAT hand-counting of all the EVMs in that constituency.</p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• ECI must use Totalizer Machines for counting of votes. It increases the secrecy of voting by counting votes polled at 14 polling booths together, as against the current practice of announcing booth-wise results.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• Regular demonstrations must be organized by EC in all the poll-going States to reduce information gap on EVMs.</p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">• EC should provide training to officers in small batches and focus on hands-on-learning. As a long term structural reform, EC must be provided with an independent secretariat so that it can have a dedicated cadre of officers.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part2136.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part2138.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
