Role of Panchayati Raj in the democracy</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Panchayati raj is no more an experiment in the Indian democratic process. It is an established administrative device. It’s major contribution includes:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Political consciousness</span><span class="p">: It enabled a large number of people to acquire leadership at local levels, especially women ( since one-third of seats are reserved for the women candidates).</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Strengthening democratic institutions and processes : </span><span class="p">The experience gained by the new generation of leadership in democratic management has raised the quality of legislative debates and working of other higher level institutions. It has provided opportunity for the circulation of political elite which is very essential for maintaining democratic forms in their true spirit.</span></p> <p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Planning and development</span><span class="p">: The PRIs have been designed to play a crucial role in planning and development. A number of studies indicate that as units of planning and development, be it at the district or lower level, the Panchayati Raj institutions have contributed substantially. In Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal and several other states, local level planning has been successfully formulated and implemented by these institutions. Ultimately to what extent the local bodies have the necessary autonomy and financial resources to take up developmental activities, depends largely on the state government.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Giving voice to local demands: </span><span class="p">PRIs have become the connecting link between the Parliament and State Legislature on the one hand and local bodies on the other so that the respective members can exchange views on the objectives of a plan and its priorities. The local members talk about the local needs, urgencies and difficulties in the implementation whereas the members of Parliament and State Legislature can explain the possible solution since they decide national priorities and at the same time they are financially in a better position to help the rural bodies. This two way link has served the dual purpose of modifying the state policies at point of maladjustment as well as communicated the message from centre and/or state to the remote corner of the rural society.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Executive Institution: </span><span class="p">Certain civic functions such as rural sanitation, public health, street lighting, drinking water supply, maintenance of village roads, culverts, management of primary and secondary education, etc., have been carried out by the Panchayati Raj bodies.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Breaking hierarchies: </span><span class="p">Panchayati Raj has become a powerful tool where caste and local</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">interests interact, clash, compromise and arrive at common understanding on various issues.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1875.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1877.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
