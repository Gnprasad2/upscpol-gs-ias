Article 253 confers exclusive power on Parliament to make any law for the whole or any part of the territory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body. In view of the vastness of the treaty making powers with the Union Government, the Commission recommends that Parliament should make a law on the subject of Entry 14 of List I (treaty making and implementing it through Parliamentary legislation) to streamline the procedures involved. The exercise of the power obviously cannot be absolute or unchartered in view of the federal structure of legislative and executive powers. Several states have expressed concern and wanted the Commission to recommend appropriate measures to protect States&#39; interests in this regard. The Commission recommends that the following aspects may be incorporated in the Central law proposed on the subject of Entry 14 of List I:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">a) <span class="p">In view of the fact that treaties, conventions or agreements may relate to all types of issues within or outside the States&#39; concern, there cannot be a uniform procedure for exercise of the power. Furthermore, since treaty making involves complex, prolonged, multi-level negotiations wherein adjustments, compromises and give and take arrangements constitute the essence, it is not possible to bind down the negotiating team with all the details that should go into it. Nonetheless, the Constitutional mandates on federal governance cannot be ignored; nor the rights of persons living in different regions or involved in different occupations compromised. Therefore there is need for a legislation to regulate the treaty making powers of the Union Executive.</span></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">b) <span class="p">Agreements which largely relate to defense, foreign relations etc. which have no bearing on individual rights or rights of States can be put in a separate category on which the Union may act on its own volition independent of prior discussion in Parliament. However, it is prudent to refer such agreements to a Parliamentary Committee concerned with the particular Ministry of the Union Government before it is ratified.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">c) <span class="p">Other treaties which affect the rights and obligations of citizens as well as those which directly impinge on subjects in State List should be negotiated with greater involvement of States and representatives in Parliament. For this purpose a note on the subject of the proposed treaty and the national interests involved may be prepared by the concerned Union Ministry and circulated to States for their views and suggestions to brief the negotiating team.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">d) <span class="p">There may be treaties or agreements which, when implemented, put obligations on particular States affecting its financial and administrative capacities. In such situations, in principle, the Centre should underwrite the additional liability of concerned States according to an agreed formula between the Centre and States.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">e) <span class="p">Financial obligations and its implications on State finances arising out of treaties and agreements should be a permanent term of reference to the Finance Commissions constituted from time to time. The Commission may be asked to recommend compensatory formulae to neutralize the additional financial burden that might arise on States while implementing the treaty/agreement.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1576.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1578.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
