The composition of the Selection Committee is such that it involves members of ruling as well as opposition party and both the Houses of Parliament. Also, the composition of NHRC is such that it involves Legislative, Executive, Judiciary, academicians and NGOs. This gives the Commission a broad vision to deal with the issues of Human Rights.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_799.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>Financial autonomy<span class="p">, </span>though limited<span class="p">, has provided NHRC independence of Central Government. The Commission is free to make its own budget and spend it according to its own planning. The draft of the proposed budget is placed before both the Houses of Parliament and after the approval of the budget, the Government, without making any amendment, has to provide finances to the Commission.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>The Commission has the power to conduct <i><b>suo-moto </b></i><b>inquiry </b>into the complaints of Human Rights violations.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="s2">Easy accessibility </span><span class="p">to the Commission has made it one of the most popular organizations.

All the documents, reports, newsletters, speeches, etc. of the Commission are also available on this website. The status of the complaint too can be known through its website. The popularity and trust on NHRC is quite evident from the fact that while it had registered only 496 complaints in 1993-94, in 2004-05 the total number of cases were 74,4019.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7">⧫</span><span class="s8"> </span>NHRC has <b>advised the government </b>a number of times on the issues of Human Rights.
