This is best demonstrated by the growth of cause groups in particular. Some of the reasons cited for increase in the number of pressure groups are:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: justify;">i. Increased leisure time<span class="p">, both in terms of the shorter working week and more early retirement, has increased the number of people with time to devote to such activities</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: justify;">ii. Higher educational standards <span class="p">have increased the numbers of people with the organisational skills to contribute to pressure groups.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: justify;">iii. Changes in gender roles <span class="p">have removed many of the barriers to participation by women in pressure group activity</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: justify;">iv. Membership of political parties has declined<span class="p">. It has been argued that this reflects the failure of the political parties adequately to reflect the needs of different groups of people in society, and that cause groups offer a more promising route for bringing about political change.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>The widening of access points through devolution â€“ </b>A variety of pressure groups have benefited from the fact that new pressure points have emerged in politics, such as:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_609.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">I. <span class="p">Devolution has allowed pressure groups to exert influence through the local/grassroots level, especially after the </span>73rd/74th Constitutional Amendment Act<span class="p">.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: justify;">II. <span class="p">The passage of the </span>Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993<span class="p">, has substantially increased pressure-group activity focused on the courts. This has especially benefited groups that represent the interests of religious or ethnic minorities, and groups that have an interest in civil liberties issues (such as Liberty).</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -29pt;text-align: justify;">III. <span class="p">Similarly, the </span>Right to Information Act, 2005 <span class="p">has also enabled more pressure groups to grow stronger and ask tough questions to those in power.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. <b>Globalization </b><i>- </i>Globalization has strengthened pressure groups in a number of ways. In particular, there is general agreement that business groups have become more powerful in a global age. This is because they are easily able to relocate production and investment, so exerting greater leverage on national governments. Such trends have strengthened pressures on governments, for instance, to cut business taxes and reduce corporate regulation.</p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another feature of globalization has been the emergence of NGOs, such as the World Development Movement and the World Social Forum, as major actors on the global stage. Some 2,400 NGOs, for example, took part in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1800.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1802.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
