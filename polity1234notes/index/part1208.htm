It is argued that declaring a bill which includes larger concerns like that of privacy, data protection etc. should also involve Rajya Sabha to have a meaningful debate.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Parliamentary logjam has been a consistent scene on the floor of parliament whereby Speaker have been unable to facilitate a smooth functioning and accused of bias.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_390.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our constitutional maker envisaged integrity and impartiality from the office. But it has been progressively eclipsed by political interests and made subservient to needs of ruling party. Judicial review in is also used in exceptional circumstances. We need a permanent institutional solution. UK’s model of appointing a committee of two senior legislators to assist the speaker over question of money bill is a case to consider. In UK, a parliamentary convention has developed, where an MP elected as Speaker, resigns from respective party. This lends credence to his impartiality.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Both, government and opposition need to cooperate so that parliament can function smoothly and speaker is not put into difficult situations too often. Also, Speaker needs to keep in mind the democratic ethos while presiding over esteemed office and his actions must appear to be objective and neutral as “Justice should not only be done, it must also be seen to be done”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1207.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1209.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
