Equally applicable is the idea of preferential discrimination in favour of backward States in the matter of fiscal devolution from Union to States. There are other federations (like USA) which give equal number of seats to the federating units in the Council of States irrespective of the size of their territory and population. The number of seats in the House of People (Lok Sabha) anyway is directly linked to</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the population and there is no need to duplicate the principle. A balance of power between States inter se is desirable and this is possible by equality of representation in the Rajya Sabha. If the Council of States has failed to function as representative of States as originally envisaged, it is because of the asymmetry of coalition politics and the way the party system developed. The functioning of Rajya Sabha can be reformed to achieve the original purpose of federal equilibrium. There should be amendment of the relevant provisions to give equality of seats to States in the Rajya Sabha, irrespective of their population size.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_522.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The reasoning of the Supreme Court in Kuldip Nayyar vs. Union of India, (2006) rejecting the status of Rajya Sabha as a Chamber representing the States in the federal Union is faulty and deserves review. Meanwhile, Parliament should act restoring section 3 of the Representation of People Act as it originally stood to redeem the federal balance in shared governance. The territorial link with that state from which a person is contesting for Rajya Sabha membership, which was prescribed by the Representation of People Act (until it was dispensed in 2003) is necessary and desirable to let the States realize that they are equal partners in national policy making and governance.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1588.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1590.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
