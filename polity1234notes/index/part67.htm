Grand Jury means that common people are selected by the government randomly, representing the community. They play a part in deciding the guilt of the accused persons. The number of persons selected to be in the grand jury varies from 6 to 12, or even more, if the case is controversial.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, in India criminal trials are adjudicated by the Judges only.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Further, in US, no person’s life and liberty shall be deprived without “due process” of law.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">Due process means that the content and procedure of law must be just, fair, and equitable, which will be decided by the judiciary.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">Legislative power of depriving a person’s liberty is restricted and scrutinized and evaluated by the judiciary.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">In India, a person’s life and liberty shall be deprived according to the “procedure established by law”.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">The word “procedure established by law” gives wide discretionary power to the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">legislature to restrict the liberty.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">o <span class="p">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi case (even though the court did not use the word due process) held that the procedure established by law must be fair, just and equitable.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The Indian Parliament deleted the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights in 1978.

Nonetheless, these rights are provided by the Supreme Court by broadly interpreting the Right to Life and Liberty under Article 21.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Further, the 8th amendment to the US Constitution says that bail shall not be denied to an accused, the imposed fine should not be excessive and inflicted punishment shall not be cruel. These rights are also made available to Indian people because of well-established precedents pronounced by the Supreme Court under Article 21.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_018.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">  ♤       <span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">9th amendment to the US Constitution is quite important because it says that mere enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution shall not be interpreted to deny the other rights retained by the American people. In spite of the statutory rights in the Constitution people enjoy other rights, which are given by nature. The American Constitution is highly influenced by Locke’s philosophy of inalienable natural rights of human being. The Indian Constitution, on the other hand, does not contain any such notable Article. Therefore, Indians enjoy only those rights recognized by the Constitution, which are based on the philosophy of Austin and Bentham’s theory of law.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part66.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part68.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
