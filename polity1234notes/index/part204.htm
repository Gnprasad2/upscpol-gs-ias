Government of India Act, 1935</p> <p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In line with the 1919 Act, the British Government announced the appointment of a seven- member statutory commission under the chairmanship of Sir John Simon to report on the condition of India under its new Constitution. All members of the commission were British and, hence, all parties boycotted the commission. To consider the proposals of commission, the British Government convened three round table conferences of the representatives of the British Government, British India and Indian princely states. On the basis of these discussions, a ‘White Paper on Constitutional Reforms’ was prepared and submitted for consideration of a British Parliamentary Committee. Recommendations of this committee were incorporated (with certain changes) in Government of India Act of 1935. This Act has a singularly important role to play in framing of the Constitution in its current form, purely owing to the fact that several features of this Act have been incorporated, one way or the other, by our Constitution makers. Also, the Act endeavoured to give a written Constitution to the country. Further, after centuries, Indians got an opportunity to assume responsibility of running the administration of their country.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some of its prominent features were:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It provided for the establishment of an All-India Federation consisting of provinces and princely states as units. The Act divided the powers between the Centre and units in terms of three lists - Federal List, Provincial List and Concurrent List. Residuary powers were given to the Viceroy. However, the federation never came into being as princely states did not join it.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It abolished dyarchy introduced in the provinces by the GOI Act, 1919 and introduced ‘provincial autonomy’ in its place. The provinces were allowed to act as autonomous units of administration in their defined spheres. Moreover, the Act introduced responsible governments in provinces, that is, the Governor was required to act with the advice of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature. This came into effect in 1937 and was discontinued in 1939.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It provided for adoption of dyarchy at the Centre. Consequently, federal subjects were divided into reserved subjects and transferred subjects. However, this provision of the Act did not come into operation at all.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Bicameralism was introduced in six out of eleven provinces. Thus, the legislatures of U.P., Bihar, Assam, Bengal, Madras and Bombay came to consist of two houses - the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, whereas other provinces consisted of one House i.e. Legislative Assembly. The membership criteria of these houses varied from province to province. At the centre, the federal legislature consisted of two houses, the Council of States and Federal Assembly consisting of 260 and 375 members respectively. The Council of States (Upper House) was a permanent body, one-third of whose members were to retire every three years.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">A Federal Court was established at the Centre.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_055.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Besides the above, it also contained the following provisions:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Formation of the provinces of Sindh and Orissa.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It further extended the principle of communal representation by providing separate electorates for depressed classes (scheduled castes), women, and labour (workers).</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">Separation of Burma and Aden from India.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The Indian Council was abolished and a few advisers, varying from 3 to 6, were appointed to advise the Secretary of States in his policy formulation towards India.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The Secretary was normally not expected to interfere in the Indian affairs, which were to be carried out by Governors.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">With respect to the changes brought in the Federal Government, the Viceroy remained its head. He exercised a wide range of powers concerning administration, legislation and finance.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">The Act created provisions for reserved subjects, to be looked after by the Viceroy through Executive Councilors. Similarly, the transferred subjects were also to be under the Viceroy, aided by Indian ministers, not more than 10 in number, selected from the legislature.</span></p> <p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">In case of the provincial government, the Governor carried on the administration with the help of a council of ministers selected by him from among the members of the provincial legislature. The composition of the provincial legislature also varied from one province to the other.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It provided for the establishment of a Reserve Bank of India to control the currency and credit of the country.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s8"> </span><span class="p">It extended the franchise and about 10 per cent of the total population got the voting right.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part203.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part205.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
