Recent Developments and Issues for Europe </p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Brexit: <span class="p">In the European elections are held in 2014 and more </span>Eurosceptics, those doubting the  efficacy of EU, <span class="p">were elected  into  the European  Parliament. Questions on  the EUs efficacy are also raised by the </span>Brexit<span class="p">, wherein frustration with EU bureaucracy combined with immigration issues led the UK to vote for an exit from the European Union in 2016. The exit negotiations will be difficult and potentially divisive, but are far less important than the negotiations on establishing a new formal relationship between the UK and the EU.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Russia: <span class="p">A new security policy was established in the wake of the </span>annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014<span class="p">. However, Europe depends on Russia&#39;s gas exports, which rose in recent years, despite rising competition and concerns about the country’s dominance of supply. State-run Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, has a monopoly over </span>Russia’s network of pipelines to Europe and supplies close to 40 per cent of Europe’s gas. <span class="p">But it has been forced to lower its prices in recent years to protect its market share in the face of moves by EU member states to buy more gas from the US, Qatar and other producers.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_198.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Refugees: <span class="p">Regional instability in the Middle East and various countries and regions around the world, leading to unrest and wars has resultedt in many people fleeing their homes and seeking refuge in Europe. </span>The 2015 refugee crisis abated after the EU-Turkey migration deal and the closure of the Balkan route in the spring of 2016<span class="p">. The total number of migrants reaching Europe by two main sea routes in 2016 fell by nearly two-thirds, to 364,000 in comparison with 2015. However, the EU needs to work on a comprehensive response to the refugee crisis that can ensure internal cohesion, in view of strong views within the members and the rise of anti immigration sentiments, as well as protect its claims of being a normative power.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">Climate change </span><span class="p">is still high on the agenda and leaders agree to reduce harmful emissions. However, it has to manage allies such as the US which has pulled out of the Paris agreement as well as developing countries that have demanded better performance on technology and funding.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">Terrorism</span><span class="p">: In recent time various European countries such as France and Germany have been target of several terrorist attacks. It is an issue that needs a EU response in view of the open borders within Europe.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">Trade and Protectionism</span><span class="p">: Much of EUs success has based on its open economy and free trade. The recent move by the United States to rase tariffs gives rise to the spectre of protectionism. EU would need to play a key role in upholding a rules based order fro global trade.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part598.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part600.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div> <script src="index.js"></script>
