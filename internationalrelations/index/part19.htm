At the beginning of the post cold war era in international relations, the <b>ascendance of US </b>raised multiple <b>questions on relevance of ideology in foreign policy </b>as well as the option of nonalignment. On the <b>economic front </b>the country was also confronted with an <b>unprecedented balance of payment crisis </b>partly as a consequence of the first <b>Gulf War of 1991</b>. This situation led to the choices that dramatically altered India’s domestic and international economic policies. This involved the adherence to <b>Washington Consensus </b>backed by the <b>IMF and the World Bank. </b>Concretely, this meant <b>structural reforms </b>that increased the role of market forces in exchange for immediate financial help. This also meant a greater quest for foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to transform India’s economy. In order to make it an attractive destination for FDI India, in this phase pursued multiple changes, such as:</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Giving up the commitment to import-substituting industrialization,</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Restructuring its vast public sector</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Dismantling the previous regime of regulations, licenses, permits and quotas.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At the same time <b>India turned towards Southeast Asia </b>in search for avenues that can be explored for engagement in economic and strategic arena. Previously, in the duration of the cold war India had been largely oblivious to the states of Southeast Asia. With the opening of its markets to foreign investment and an eye on development of a viable export sector, the country embarked upon a “<b>Look East policy” after 1991</b>. While these changes were afoot, the P.V. Narasimha Rao Government in <b>1992</b>, in the context of the <b>Oslo Accord </b>between Israel and the Palestinians, <b>upgraded its diplomatic relations with Israel to the ambassadorial level</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_009.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With <b>China </b>the Narasimha Rao government continued a process that had been initiated during the Rajiv Gandhi government<b>. </b>During the Prime Minister <b>Narsimha Rao’s visit to China in September 1993 </b>a land mark <b>agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) </b>in the India - China Border Area was signed<b>. </b>This was followed up by the <b>visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 1996 </b>when another <b>agreement on Confidence-Building Measures (CBM) in the Military Field </b>was signed.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the neighbourhood <span class="p">India reassessed its tactics to bring about transformation in relations with its neighbours.
