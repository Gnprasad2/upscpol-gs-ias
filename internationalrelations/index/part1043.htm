Though aimed at Eastern Europeans, this law had the collateral effect of prohibiting the entry of Middle Easterners, East Asians, and Indians to the US. According to the U.S. Department of State at the time, the purpose of the act was “to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity.”</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Similarly, at the turn of the century in Canada, also part of the British Empire at that time, there were about 100 Indians. <span class="p">This </span>number rose to 5,000 by 1907<span class="p">, before a restrictive new law, the </span>Continuous Passage regulation<span class="p">, stopped any further immigration. </span>This law required that all migrants who intended to immigrate to Canada make a continuous journey from the countries of their citizenship<span class="p">. This law stopped Indian immigration in its tracks, since no steamships traveled directly from India to Canada. This became most evident in the “</span>Komagatamaru” incident of 1914<span class="p">, when more than 350 immigrants from India sent back from Vancouver, as the ship carrying them, the Komagatamaru, had not travelled continuously form India to Canada.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1042.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1044.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div> <script src="index.js"></script>
