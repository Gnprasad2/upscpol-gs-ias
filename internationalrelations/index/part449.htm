All independent West Asian countries then had strongly anti- Communist, pro-West regimes and had become a part of the American-led bloc in the context of the newly emerged Cold War. However, to the West’s great disappointment, even anger, India adopted a unique approach - not being aligned with either camp.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">India’s consistent support for the Palestinian cause and pan-Arab nationalism </span><span class="p">with strong denunciations of Israeli and Western policies further angered Western powers.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">India had consistently provided a welcoming haven to Jewish people going back 2000 years.

Pakistan’s belligerent hostility to India from day one was also manifested in its malevolent use of the Islamic card against India. </span>There was automatic Western and Arab/Iranian/Turkish support for the emergence of Pakista<span class="p">n and in the many disputes that Pakistan created with India and in the wars that it initiated against India starting from its brazen invasion of Kashmir on October 22, 1947.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_156.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">Britain sponsored the Baghdad Pact (1955), a military alliance with the region’s heavyweights — the Shah’s Iran and Iraq (until 1958 a pro-Western monarchy) as well as Pakistan and Turkey — </span><span class="p">in order to ensure its continued strategic control over the region and particularly to prevent the ingress of any Soviet influence. However, Pakistan’s sole motivation to join the alliance was the “India factor.” Unsurprisingly, India strongly denounced the formation of this military alliance.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>In the context of non alignment India had viewed the advent of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt very positively <span class="p">and had great empathy with the Nasserite ideology of pan-Arab nationalism, socialism, secular and republican governance. </span>India supported Egypt strongly during the Suez crisis (1956) <span class="p">and against the consequent Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt and later in the 1967 war with Israel.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>In 1969 after the Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Morocco invited India to the summit of Muslim countries in Rabat, <span class="p">which led to the formation of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (O.I.C.), </span>India was not allowed to participate after the inaugural session due to Pakistan’s threat to walk out.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">To India’s great annoyance, the O.I.C. and its Contact Group (established at the O.I.C. summit in Tehran in 1994) adopted, at Pakistani instigation, strongly worded anti-India recommendations, resolutions and statements regularly on Kashmir and on the supposed plight of Indian Muslims. Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have been proactively involved throughout.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">India&#39;s relationship with Iraq under Saddam Hussein was close, multidimensional and fruitful</span><span class="p">. Indeed, it was probably India’s most valuable and productive bilateral relationship in West Asia during the Cold War period. India implemented dozens of projects in Iraq and provided military training, particularly for the Iraqi air force. Iraq was India’s leading oil supplier. And Saddam Hussein extended explicit political support in the context of India’s problems with Pakistan. Both countries were close to the Soviet Union. However, this was viewed negatively by almost all West Asian countries.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">The 1979 Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan and the consequent mounting of the modern jihad by the United States, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan </span><span class="p">to evict Soviet forces became a particularly strong cementing factor between them while becoming yet another source of severe dissonance between India on the one hand, and West Asian countries and the West on the other.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">As the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan intensified, the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) also became a particularly strong Pakistan supporter.

So dire was the state of the economy that India’s gold reserves were physically airlifted to Europe in 1990 in order to enable an International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) loan.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">Post Cold War India ceased viewing West Asia through the prism of its issues with Pakistan, </span><span class="p">discontinued the use of strong rhetoric denouncing other countries’ policies, and abandoned defensive, reactive policy approaches.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>India also started consciously courting the United States<span class="p">, now the lone global superpower.

Chairman Arafat’s full concurrence, </span>Narasimha Rao established full diplomatic relations with Israel in January 1992, <span class="p">disregarding extremely strong domestic criticism.

The spreading Islamist extremist militancy and terrorism in Pakistan and West Asia — while the world’s third largest Muslim community in India remained immune to this danger — presented a particularly strong and impressive contrast internationally.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">Taken together, these developments constituted public recognition that the world welcomed India’s rise, in contrast with growing anxieties about China’s rise. </span><span class="s1">These same circumstances also persuaded Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies to look at India very differently.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">In response to Pakistan’s adventurism in Kargil in 1999, West Asian countries and the West declined to support Pakistan </span><span class="p">— the first time such response in the long history of the India-Pakistan conflict.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="p">With the advent of the new millennium, </span><span class="s1">there has been an extraordinary turnaround in the relationship between the Gulf Cooperation Council (G.C.C.) countries and India.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>The Indo-Iranian economic relationship is also poised for a dramatic upsurge<span class="p">. On May 24, 2016, Prime Minister Modi and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani signed a </span>historic deal to develop the strategic port of Chabahar <span class="p">and thereby open transport-and-trade corridor to and through Afghanistan to Central Asia and Europe.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">First ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Israel in 2017 </span><span class="p">and reciprocal visit of Israel’s</span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">prime minister in 2018 have moved relations with Israel in to the fore.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Prime Minster Modi’s stand alone visit to Palestine in 2018 <span class="p">again reiterated India’s support for a Palestinian state and completed what is known as </span>de-hyphenation of relations <span class="p">between India on the one hand and Israel and Palestine on the other.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3"> </span><span class="s1">Wars in Syria and Yemen, emergence of ISIS, difference between Iran and Arab States as well as political transition, mark different aspects of current conflicts in West Asia</span><span class="p">.
