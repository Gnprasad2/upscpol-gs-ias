This was majorly on account Pakistan’s role in the <b>armed insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir since December 1989</b>. With the outbreak of the insurgency Pakistan’s leadership helped transform a largely internal militancy into an ideologically charged <b>proxy war</b>. In this context and in view of the <b>clandestine nuclear programme of Islamabad </b>concerns regarding conventional military balance played large on India’s security calculations.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Coupled with the Pakistan factor, the calculation from nuclear threat posed by China drove <b>India’s nuclear weapons program to its next stage</b>. In this scenario, the successful <b>extension of NPT </b>in <b>1995 </b>and the efforts by United States to complete the <b>Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)</b>, which came up in <b>1996</b>, coincided with India seriously considering its nuclear options. Thus, the Indian policymakers chose to exercise the nuclear option to thwart rising pressures to accede to the international nuclear regimes. India declared itself a fully fledged nuclear state after <b>5 nuclear tests at Pokharan in May 1998</b>. This attracted <b>sanctions from United States and the other great powers</b>; and led to the recognition of India as a de facto nuclear power in the later years.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.3.1. Beginning of A New Era</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This was also the beginning of an era of <b>new engagement with the United States</b>, which involved bilateral negotiations between <b>US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and India’s Minister of External Affairs Jaswant Singh (1998-2000)</b>. This was followed by a visit of <b>President Clinton to India in 2000</b>. The upswing in these relations since this period culminated in the <b>Civil Nuclear Deal of 2005 </b>which de-facto recognized India as a nuclear power as well as</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">its responsible record on non-proliferation, thus paving way for an the beginning of the end to its isolation at technology regimes such as the <b>Multilateral Export Control Regimes (MECR).</b></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under <b>Prime Minster Atal Bihari Vajpayee </b>diplomacy with Pakistan<b>, </b>including a <b>Bus trip involving the Prime Minister across the Border in 1999, </b>could not yield much results<b>. </b>The <b>Lahore declaration of February 1999 </b>was followed by <b>incursion in the Kargil </b>region in Jammu and Kashmir. This led to a limited war between the two nuclear states in 1999. Despite this provocation <b>India exercised remarkable restraint </b>and a large-scale war was effectively avoided. Significantly, Washington sojourn of Pakistan’s then Prime Minister Nawaz Shariff was marked by considerable coldness. This perhaps was the sign coming changes in the relation between India, United States and Pakistan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_010.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Terrorism <span class="p">which had been a key challenge for India became a key issue in global politics after the cold war and especially since the </span>11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York<span class="p">. In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the </span>Indian parliament in December 2001 <span class="p">India resorted to a strategy of </span>coercive diplomacy <span class="p">which yielded limited results. India’s coercive options against the terror ploy were limited, as nuclear capability of Pakistan meant greater possibility of a conflict escalating into a nuclear one and thus inviting the United States to intervene. Thus, India has been seeking recognition of terrorism as a global scourge which requires a concerted action by the international community. To this end </span>India has been pursuing the Comprehensive Convention Against International Terrorism at the United Nations since 1996<span class="p">, although without much success due to difference in the international community. Nonetheless, the </span>2008 attacks in Mumbai<span class="p">, though a tragic occasion, demonstrated a greater isolation of Pakistan and allowed for closer anti-terrorism cooperation between India and the United States.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The changes in the international scenario presented certain choices in front of India and as a response multiple changes were made. Nonetheless, its commitment to inclusive development and a just world order remain a continuous  facet of  its policy. For instance, at the <b>WTO negotiations, </b>especially in the <b>Doha development round, </b>India has spearheaded the concerns of the developing countries, the <b>Doha declaration of 2001 </b>is testimony to the values that India still holds in the international sphere. Similarly, India, while upholding its national interests, has not shied away from upholding the principles of equity and responsibility, as reflected in its role in the <b>Climate negotiations</b>. Here too India has not shied away from forming a loose coalition with like minded nations as Brazil, South Africa, and China (<b>BASIC)</b>.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>economic profile of India ever since 1991 along with, it’s educated manpower, military and technological prowess have acquired greater recognition</b>. These factors have led India being labelled as <b>emerging power </b>and a <b>potential great power</b>. During the <b>global economic crisis of 2008, </b>India played an important role in global negotiations through mediums such as the <b>G-20. </b>Nonetheless, its quest for reforms <b>at the United Nations, </b>along with the <b>Group of 4, </b>has not born results. Even so, through groupings such as <b>BRICS </b>India has expressed its <b>intention to reshape the global order through multilateral efforts.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">These objectives, challenges, and opportunities have continued to shape foreign policymaking in India under <b>Prime Minister Narendra Modi since 2014</b>. Thus, in the recent years neighbourhood has acquired new salience, so have multiple engagements with key states in international relations. <b>India’s membership </b>of the <b>Missile Technology Control Regime (2016)</b>, <b>Wassenaar Arrangement (2017) </b>and <b>Australia Group (2018) </b>are certain achievements of the recent years; however, the membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group remains a challenge to contend with.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part19.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part21.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div> <script src="index.js"></script>
