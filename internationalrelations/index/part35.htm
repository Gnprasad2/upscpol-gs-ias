Since the number of members has grown very large, it often becomes difficult to adopt an approach that all countries can follow. <b>The NAM lost some of its fervor after the end of Cold War, though its relevance is claimed by various leaders</b>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">NAM: Role after the Cold War</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since the end of the Cold War and the formal end of colonialism, <b>the Non-Aligned Movement has been forced to redefine itself and reinvent its purpose in the current world system. </b>A major question has been whether many of its foundational ideologies, principally national independence, territorial integrity, and the struggle against colonialism and imperialism, can be applied to contemporary issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The movement has emphasised its <b>principles of multilateralism, equality, and mutual non- aggression in attempting to become a stronger voice for the global South</b>, and an instrument that can be utilised to promote the needs of member nations at the international level and strengthen their political leverage when negotiating with developed nations. In its efforts to advance Southern interests, the movement has stressed the importance of cooperation and unity amongst member states, but as in the past, cohesion remains a problem since the size of</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_018.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the organisation and the divergence of agendas and allegiances present the ongoing potential for fragmentation.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While agreement on basic principles has been smooth, taking definitive action vis-à-vis particular international issues has been rare<span class="p">, with the movement preferring to assert its criticism or support rather than pass hard-line resolutions. The movement continues to see a role for itself, as in its view, the world’s poorest nations remain exploited and marginalised, no longer by opposing superpowers, but rather in a uni-polar world, and it is Western hegemony and neo-colonialism that the movement has really re-aligned itself against. It opposes foreign occupation, interference in internal affairs, and aggressive unilateral measures, but it has also shifted to focus on the socio-economic challenges facing member states, especially the inequalities manifested by globalisation and the implications of neo-liberal policies. </span>The Non- Aligned Movement has identified economic underdevelopment, poverty, and social injustices as growing threats to peace and security.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Recent activities and positions of NAM:</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Summits</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13th Summit: <span class="p">13th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement was held in </span>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 24-25 February 2003.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14th Summit: <span class="p">The 14th Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non- Aligned Movement was held in Havana</span>, Cuba, from 11-16 September 2006.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15th Summit: <span class="p">On </span>15 July 2009<span class="p">, NAM concluded its 15th summit meeting at an Egyptian Red Sea Resort in </span>Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">16th Summit: from 26-31 August 2012<span class="p">, the 16th Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement was held in </span>Tehran, Iran<span class="p">.

The movement’s leaders have also criticized the American control over the United Nations and other international structures.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Self-determination of Puerto Rico</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since 1961, the group have supported the discussion of the case of Puerto Rico&#39;s self- determination before the United Nations.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Self-determination of Western Sahara</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Since 1973, the group have supported the discussion of the case of Western Sahara&#39;s self- determination before the United Nations.

Issues such as globalisation, the debt burden, unfair trade practices, the decline in foreign aid, donor conditionalities, and the lack of democracy in international financial decision-making are cited as factors inhibiting development.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reforms of the UN</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Non-Aligned Movement has been quite outspoken in its criticism of current UN structures and power dynamics, mostly in how the organisation has been utilised by powerful states in ways that violate the movement’s principles. It has made a number of recommendations that would strengthen the representation and power of ‘non-aligned’ states. The proposed reforms are also aimed at improving the transparency and democracy of UN decision- making. The UN Security Council is the element considered the most distorted, undemocratic, and in need of reshaping.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">South-south cooperation</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Lately the Non-Aligned Movement has collaborated with other organisations of the developing world, primarily the Group of 77, forming a number of joint committees and releasing statements and document representing the shared interests of both groups. This dialogue and cooperation can be taken as an effort to increase the global awareness about the organisation and bolster its political clout.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cultural diversity and human rights</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The movement accepts the universality of human rights and social justice, but fiercely resists cultural homogenisation. In line with its views on sovereignty, the organisation appeals for the protection of cultural diversity, and the tolerance of the religious, socio-cultural, and historical particularities that define human rights in a specific region.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Feel Free to add your Own Notes in blank Spaces</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s14">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h3 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.
