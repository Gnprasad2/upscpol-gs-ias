Reasons for Non-Alignment </p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India had adopted the policy of non-alignment as it did not want to lose its freedom of decision-making, and because India’s primary concern soon after independence was economic development<span class="p">. The policy has been sustained for five decades. </span>Professor M.S. Rajan <span class="p">had mentioned </span>seven reasons for adopting this policy initially<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Firstly, it was felt that <b>India’s alignment with either the US or the  USSR bloc would aggravate international tension</b>, rather than promote international peace. Besides, the Indian Government left later than in view of size, geopolitical importance and contribution to civilization, India had “a positive role to play in reducing international tension, promoting peace and serving as a bridge between the two camps.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_016.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Secondly, <b>India was neither a great power, nor could she allow herself to be treated as a nation of no consequence</b>. India was, however, potentially a great power. Non-alignment suited India’s “present needs to keep out national identity” and on the other hand not to compromise “out future role of an acknowledged Great Power.”</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Thirdly, <b>India could not join either of the power blocs because of emotional and ideological reasons</b>. We could not join the Western (American) Bloc because many of its member countries were colonial powers or ex-colonial powers, and some still practiced racial discrimination. We could not join the Eastern (Soviet) Blot because communism, as an ideology, was completely alien to Indian thinking and way of life.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Fourthly, <b>like any sovereign country, India, who had just become sovereign, wanted to retain and exercise independence of judgement</b>, and not to “be tied to the apron-strings of another country.” It meant that India wanted freedom to decide every issue on its merit.</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Fifthly, <b>once India launched economic development plans, we needed foreign economic aid </b>“it was both <b>desirable politically not to depend upon aid from one bloc only</b>, and profitable to be able to get it from more than one source.”</p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Sixthly, non-alignment is <b>in accordance with India’s traditional belief that “truth, right and goodness” are not the monopoly of anyone religion or philosophy</b>. India believes in tolerance. Therefore, the world situation, called for tolerance and peaceful co-existence of both the systems, with India not aligning with any of the blocs, nor being hostile to them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3"> </span>Lastly, the <b>domestic political situation was also responsible for the adoption of the policy of non-alignment. </b>According to Professor Rajan, “By aligning India with either of the Blocks, the Indian Government would have sown seeds of political controversy and instability in the country…”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Whatever the actual reasons that may have promoted Nehru and his Government to adopt the policy of non-alignment, it is obvious that <b>the people of India by and large supported the policy</b>. Many other countries found it in their national interest to adopt this policy which led to the establishment of the Non-Alignment Movement.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part32.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part34.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div> <script src="index.js"></script>
