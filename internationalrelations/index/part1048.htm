Though our share of the population in the US is less than 1%, Indians account for well over 5% of the scientists, engineers, and software specialists, and almost 10% of all the doctors. No group, not whites, not the Chinese, nor the Jewish people, has a higher median household income than Indians, which is almost double that of the overall average of the United States.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_317.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Diaspora has contributed to India’s ascendency in the world.

This new “Brand India” explains the increased interest in recruiting Indian graduates and professionals in several countries.It also contributes to the willingness of US and other companies to collaborate with, and outsource to, Indian companies. </span>Ethnic Indians, particularly in New Diaspora countries, have become known for their economic, professional, academic, scientific, and artistic successes, as well as for their generally peaceful integration.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the Old Diaspora<span class="p">, Indians have become integral part of their countries. In countries such as Mauritius names such as Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anerood Jugnauth, Navin Chandra Ramgoolam and Pravind Jugnauth are prominent in politics serving as the heads of state and governement. Similalry, Trinidad and Tobago has seen two Indian origin prime ministers- Basdeo Panday and Kamala Persad Bissessar. Another Indo-Trinidadian VS Naipaul is much celebrated author and Nobel Laureate.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In Malay Peninsula the Indian Community played a key part in the decolonization process and Malaysian Indian Congress had been a key part of the ruling alliance coalition of the Alliance Party (BN- Barisan Nasional).
