The Indus System</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Indus (Sindhu) is one of the most important drainage systems of the Indian subcontinent and one of the largest in the world. It covers an area of 11, 65,000 sq. km and length of 2,880 km, out of which 321, 289 sqkm area and 1,114 km length is in India. The Indus is the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_191.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">westernmost of the Himalayan rivers in India. Indus has origin from a glacier near Bokar Chu in the Kailash Mountain range in  the Tibet province of  China.  In  Tibet, it is known as ‘Singi Khamban; or Lion’s mouth. After flowing in a constricted valley in Tibet, it follows a long, nearly straight course between the Ladakh and Zaskar ranges in the northwest direction where it receives Zaskar below Leh town. It cuts across the Ladakh range, forming a spectacular gorge near Gilgit which is 5200m in height. In this region, transverse glaciers and landslides periodically dam the river. River passes Nanga Parbat and turns south-west to enter Pakistan near Chillar in the Dardistan region. In the Jammu and Kashmir, Indus receives a number of Himalayan tributaries such  as the Shyok, the Gilgit, the Hunza,  the Nubra, the Shigar, the Gasting and the Dras. Right bank tributaries such as the Khurram, the Tochi, etc. originate in Sulaiman ranges. Down in the Punjab province of Pakistan, Indus receives <b>‘Panjnad’</b>, five rivers of Punjab, namely the Satluj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum. River finally drains into the Arabian Sea, east of Karachi city. These rivers do not meet Indus separately but as a single river.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Jhelum (Vitasta) rises from a spring at Verinag Spring situated at the foot of the Pir Panjal. It flows through Srinagar and the Wular lake before entering Pakistan through a deep narrow gorge. It joins the Chenab in Pakistan. It is the most important river of Kashmir.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Chenab (Asikni) flows in India for about 1180km draining around 26,755 sqkm area. It is the largest tributary of the Indus. It is formed by two streams, the Chandra and the Bhaga, which join at Tandi near Keylong in Himachal Pradesh. Hence, it is also known as Chandrabhaga. Major hydro power plants installed in Chenab are Salal, Baghliar, and Dulhasti.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Ravi (Parushni) river flows for about 725 km and drains 6000 sqkm area in India. It rises near the Rohtang Pass in Kullu hills in Himachal Pradesh, very close to the source of the Beas river. It flows through the famous Chamba valley. It drains an area lying between Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges. It also cuts a gorge in Dhaula Dhar range. In plains of Punjab, it runs along the Indo-Pak border and joins Chenab near Sarai Sidhu in Pakistan.</p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Beas (Vipasa) river originates from the Beas Kund near the Rohtang Pass at an elevation of 4,000 m. The river flows through the Kullu valley and forms gorges at Kati and Largi in the Dhaula Dhar range. Further down, it flows through the Kangra valley. It enters the Punjab plains where it meets the Satluj near Harike in India’s Punjab. Indira Gandhi Canal that feeds western Rajasthan has origin at Harike, confluence of Beas and Satluj.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Satluj (Satadru) river rises from the Rakas Lake near Mansarovar (4,555m) in Tibet. This is an antecedent river. It flows almost parallel to the Indus for about 400 km before entering India, and comes out of a gorge across the Great Himalayas. It passes through the Shipki La (4300 m) on the Himalayan ranges at India-China border. It cuts the Zaskar ranges, Dhaula Dhar range, Shiwalik and finally enters the Punjab plains. It feeds the canal system of the Bhakra Nangal project.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Ghaggar (Saraswati) is an inland drainage which rises in the talus fan of the Shiwalik near Ambala, Haryana. After entering the plains, it disappears but reappears at Karnal. Further on, the stream disappears near Hanumargarh in Bikaner. It is believed that it is an old tributary of the Indus.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part304.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part306.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
