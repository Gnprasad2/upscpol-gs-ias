Information Technology and its Components</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Induction of IT as a strategic tool for agricultural development and welfare of rural India requires that the necessary IT infrastructure is in place. The rapid changes and downward trend in prices in various components of IT makes it feasible to target at a large scale IT penetration into rural India. Some of the broad factors to be noted with respect to various components of IT are listed below:</p> <p class="s11" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s12"> </span><span class="s2">Input Devices: </span><span class="p">Radical improvements are witnessed with respect to the means of communication by human  beings with computers such as key boards, mouse devices, scanners. The advent of touch screen monitors that allow users to give input to computers by touching on the appropriate location of the monitor has made it possible to develop user-friendly interface for farmers which is easy, intuitive, circumvents language barrier and at the same time provides a relaxed environment to the users. The present day digital cameras make it possible to capture and store good quality graphics and large video clips. The small size and low weight of these digital cameras, which are increasingly becoming affordable, open up the possibilities of providing computer based demonstration clips to educate the farmers. The digital cameras can also be used to upload plant stress related images, movie clips which can facilitate an expert residing at a far of location to quickly recommend a solution.</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s12"> </span><span class="s2">Output Devices: </span><span class="p">Monitor screens, printers &amp; plotters, data projectors support high resolution and good quality output. The qualities of these output devices have the potential of generating renewed interest in the farmers in using IT based services. The light weight portable data projectors can be easily carried by the agricultural extension personnel for serving larger audience. Similarly, speakers can also be attached to the computers to incorporate voice based trainings for farmers.</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s12"> </span><span class="s2">Processors: </span><span class="p">The processing speeds of computers have gone up. At present high speed processorsare available which makes it possible to undertake substantial processing of data at the client side.</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s12"> </span><span class="s2">Storage Devices: </span><span class="p">80GB and even higher hard disk drives have become common in PC range of computers. This makes it possible to store substantial information at the local level which facilitates faster access. Similarly, high capacity pen drives, CDs make it possible to transfer large volumes of data to locations which cannot be connected to networks immediately. These storage devices are also used for backup of crucial data. As a precaution, many corporate store their backups at locations away from the place of work.</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s12"> </span><span class="s2">Software: </span><span class="p">Various operating systems are available which act as interface between the user and the machine. The graphic user interface (GUI) has become an accepted prerequisite for</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">end users. Application software which can support complex user requirements are available. Of the shelf solutions for office automation packages, groupware applications, complex database solutions, communication products, solutions based on remote sensing &amp; geographical information systems are available. In addition, solutions based on some or all  of  these are also readily available. The present downward  trend  in the IT industry provides an opportunity get customised application for any specific task developed at an affordable price. <u>Rapid Application Development and Deployment (RADD)</u> is  a popular model for quick development and deployment of applications. Development environment itself is simplified with tools that quicken the pace of software specialists. Project management and monitoring software are available that facilitate efficient execution of large and complex applications that are required for rural India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_627.png"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s12"> </span><span class="s2">Networking Devices: </span><span class="p">The capacity of modems, used to convert the data from digital to analog and vice versa, which are popularly employed to use telephone lines have increased. Internal modems are available integrated into the computer so that they are not exposed to outside environment. The capacities of other networking devices such as routers have also gone up which makes it possible to create large networks with smooth data transmission.</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s12"> </span><span class="s2">Transmission Media: </span><span class="p">The media  through which the data transfer takes place has also undergone revolutionary change. Telephone lines are still the popular source in India although the reliability and low bandwidth are still major issues. High capacity cables, optical fibre, radio, wireless local loops, satellite transmission and various solutions based on a combination of these are already being used in many parts of the country.</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s12"> </span><span class="s2">Other Accessories: </span><span class="p">Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) devices are crucial to ensure the durability of the IT equipment as well as provide backup mechanisms. The potential of solar power packs to provide a feasible solution to shortage of power in the rural areas needs to be exploited.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part981.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part983.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
