Existing Systems of Agricultural Marketing in India</p><p class="s94" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The existing systems of agricultural marketing in India are as briefly described here: -</p><p class="s125" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s126"> </span><span class="s93">Sale to moneylenders and traders: </span><span class="s94">A considerable part of the total produce is sold by the farmers to the village traders and moneylenders. According to an estimate 85% of wheat, 75% of oil seeds in U.P., 90% of jute in West Bengal and 60% of wheat, 70% of oil seeds and 35% of cotton in Punjab are sold by the farmers in the villages themselves. Often the money lenders act as a commission agent of the wholesale trader.</span></p><p class="s125" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s126"> </span><span class="s93">Hats and shanties: </span><span class="s94">Hats are village markets often held once or twice a week, while shanties are also village markets held at longer intervals or on special occasions. The agents of the wholesale merchants, operating in different mandies also visit these markets. Most of &quot;hats&quot; are very poorly equipped, are uncovered and lack storage, drainage, and other facilities. It is important to observe that only small and marginal farmers sell their produce in such markets. The big farmers with large surplus go to the larger wholesale markets.</span></p> <p class="s125" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s126"> </span><span class="s93">Mandies or wholesale markets: </span><span class="s94">One wholesale market often serves a number of villages and is generally located in a city. In such mandies, business is carried on by arhatiyas. The farmers sell their produce to these arhatiyas with the help of brokers, who are generally the agents of arhatiyas. Because of the malpractices of these middlemen, problems of transporting the produce from villages to mandies, the small and marginal farmers are hesitant of coming to these mandies. The arhatiyas of these mandies sell off the produce to the retail merchants. However, paddy, cotton and oilseeds are sold off to the mills for processing. The marketing system for sugarcane is different. The farmers sell their produce directly to the sugar mills.</span></p><p class="s125" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s126"> </span><span class="s93">Co-operative marketing: </span><span class="s94">To improve the efficiency of the agricultural marketing and to save farmers from the exploitation and malpractices of middlemen, emphasis has been laid on the development of co-operative marketing societies. Such societies are formed by farmers to take advantage of collective bargaining. A marketing society collects surplus from it members and sell it in the mandi collectively. This improves the bargaining power of the members and they are able to obtain a better price for the produce. In addition to the sale of produce, these societies also serve the members in a number of other ways.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part948.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part950.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
