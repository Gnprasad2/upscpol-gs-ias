Geography of Indian Ocean</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.1. Significance of Indian Ocean for India</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Significance of Indian Ocean for India can be discussed under following heads:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. <b>Geopolitical Significance: </b>The Indian Ocean Region (IOR), comprising the ocean and its littorals, is India’s regional or <i>immediate geo-strategic environment</i>. It exists on the fringes of our boundaries and has a significant impact on the internal state of affairs.Indian Ocean defines the Indian Navy’s primary Area of Maritime Interest, where it seek to address the challenges having a bearing on national security and the nation’s overall socio-economic development.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_333.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With substantial economic activity, including 90% trade by volume and bulk of our energy imports, happening over the sea, <b>maritime security </b>is central to overall development of our nation. Concurrently, India cannot hope to develop and grow peacefully with an unstable and turbulent neighbourhood. Prevalence of peace in the Indian Ocean Region is therefore a key national security imperative.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Riding on the benefits of globalisation, littorals of the IOR are now re-emerging to achieve their original potential. The emergence of many regional countries, as economic powerhouses, reflects this reality. Consequently, several regional economic groupings such as ASEAN, BIMSTEC, SAARC, IOR-ARC, GCC and few others have evolved over time in the IOR to harness the advantages of economic integration.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">India’s <b>geo-strategic location </b>positions us right at the confluence of major arteries of world trade. The Indian Navy is therefore viewed by some of the littorals as a suitable agency to facilitate regional maritime security in the IOR as a <b>net security provider</b>. India’s standing as a <b>benign power </b>provides credence to this perception, making us a preferred partner for regional security.</p> <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Economic security <span class="p">is central to the comprehensive approach to security. In this globalised world, the Indian economy is integrated with, and consequently interdependent on other world economies. The prospect of disruption of trade at critical chokepoints, such as the Strait of Hormuz or Malacca, can be catastrophic for the global economy. The downstream effects of such economic upheaval are certainly disastrous for regional peace. Maintaining unimpeded flow of energy and other commodities over the sea is therefore a prime concern for all nations, including ours.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Maritime terrorism <span class="p">is another grave challenge. The events of 26/11 brought to fore the porosity of our long coastline and its resultant vulnerability to terror attacks perpetrated from the sea. Moreover, the prospect of terror attacks on off-shore infrastructure and sea- borne traffic, close to the coast, puts a premium on ensuring </span>coastal security<span class="p">. Consequent to government directives, the Navy is now responsible for overall maritime security of the country, including the coast.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The region’s natural bounties and maritime trade carried over its sea lanes drive the global economy. The fact that two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments, one-third of its bulk cargo and half of the container traffic transit over its sea lanes, and through its choke points, a large part of  which is meant for countries outside the region, underscores the Indian Ocean’s importance for the world at large.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In conclusion, maintenance of a peaceful maritime environment is an imperative, for our nation and the region, to sustain our growth trajectories and to achieve our national aspirations. The oceans are vast, challenges too many, and resources limited, for any individual state to assure security of the global commons. This, therefore, calls for a cooperative approach. By virtue of <b>India’s geo-strategic location </b>in the Indian Ocean and her <b>maritime capabilities</b>, the Indian Navy is deemed by many to be the net security provider in the IOR.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. <b>Economic Significance: </b>Economic importance of the Indian Ocean is immense. It can be discussed on the following points:</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">a. About 30% of <i>world trade </i>is handled in the ports of the Indian Ocean.</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">b. Half of the world’s <i>container traffic </i>passes through Indian Ocean.</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">c. <i>Continental shelves </i>cover about 4.2% of the total area of the Indian Ocean and are reported to be very Rich in minerals including Tin, Gold, Uranium, Cobalt, Nickel, Aluminium and Cadmium although these resources have been largely not exploited, so far.</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">d. 40 out of 54 types of <i>raw materials </i>used by U.S. industry are supplied by the Indian Ocean.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_334.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">e. Several of the world’s <i>top container ports</i>, including Port Kelang and Singapore, are located in Indian Ocean as well as some of the world’s fastest growing and busiest ports.</p><p style="padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">f. Indian Ocean possesses some of the <i>world’s largest fishing grounds</i>, providing approximately 15%of the total world’s fish catch (approximately 9 million tons per annum).</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">g. 55% of known <i>world oil reserves </i>are present in Indian Ocean.</p><p style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">h. 40% of the <i>world’s natural gas reserves </i>are in Indian Ocean littoral states.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part516.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part518.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
