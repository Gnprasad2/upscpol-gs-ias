Main Shipping Canals</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Shipping canals are canals especially intended to accommodate ships used on the oceans, seas or lakes to which it is connected. As opposed to it, a barge canal is intended to carry barges and other vessels specifically designed for river and/or canal navigation. Because of the constraints of accommodating vessels capable of navigating large bodies of open water, a ship canal typically offers deeper water. Ship canals are constructed for a number of reasons which include creating a shortcut and avoiding lengthy detours; to create a navigable shipping link between two land-locked seas or lakes; to provide inland cities with a direct shipping link to the sea; and to provide an economical alternative to other options.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part848.htm">List of Important Shipping Canals in the World</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part846.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part848.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
