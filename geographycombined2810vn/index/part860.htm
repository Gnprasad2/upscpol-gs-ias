Pipeline Transport in India</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pipeline transport in India dates back to 1959 when Oil India Limited (OIL) was incorporated as a company. Asiaâ€™s first cross country pipeline covering a distance of 1,157 km was constructed by OIL from Naharkatiya oilfield in Assam to Barauni refinery in Bihar. Other extensive network of pipelines has been constructed in the western region of India of which Ankleshwar-Koyali, Mumbai High- Koyali and Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) are most important. Recently, a 1256 km  long pipeline connecting  Salaya (Gujarat) with Mathura  (U.P.) has  been constructed.  It supplies crude oil from Gujarat to Punjab (Jalandhar) via Mathura.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some of the important pipelines are briefly described as under:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_558.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">1. Naharkatia-Nunmati-Barauni Pipeline: <span class="p">This was the first pipeline constructed in India to bring crude oil from Naharkatia oilfield to Nunmati. It was later extended to transport crude oil to refinery at Barauni in Bihar. It is 1,167 km long. It is now extended to Kanpur in U.P.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">2. Mumbai High-Mumbai-Ankleshwar-Koyali Pipeline: <span class="p">This pipeline connects oilfields of Mumbai High and Gujarat with oil refinery at Koyali. A 210 km long double pipeline connects Mumbai with Mumbai High. It provides facilities for transporting crude oil and natural gas. Ankleshwar-Koyali pipeline was completed in 1965. It transports crude oil from Ankleshwar oilfield to Koyali refinery.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">3. Salaya-Koyali-Mathura Pipeline: <span class="p">An important pipeline has been laid from Salaya in Gujarat to Mathura in U.P. via Viramgram. This is 1,256 km long pipeline which supplies crude oil to refineries at Koyali and Mathura. From Mathura, it has been extended to the oil refinery at Panipat in Haryana and further to Jalandhar in Punjab. It has an offshore terminal for imported crude oil.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">4. Hajira-Vijapur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) Gas Pipeline: <span class="p">This pipeline has been constructed by Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) to transport gas. It is 1,750 km long and connects Hazira in Maharashtra to Vijapur in M.P. and Jagdishpur in U.P. It carries 18 million cubic metres of gas everyday to three power houses at Kawas (Gujarat), Anta (Rajasthan) and Auraiya (U.P.) and to six fertilizer plants at Bijapur, Sawai Madhopur,. Jagdishpur, Shahjahanpur, Aonla and Babrala.</span></p> <p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">5. Jamnagar-Loni LPG Pipeline: <span class="p">This 1,269 km long pipeline has been constructed by Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) at the cost of Rs. 1,250 crore. It connects Jamnagar in Gujarat to Loni near Delhi in U.P. and passes through the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and U.P. This is the longest LPG pipeline of the world. It is equivalent to transporting 3.5 lakh LPG gas cylinders across 1,269 km every day and its capacity is being increased to 5.0 lakh cylinder per day.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">6. Kandla-Bhatinda Pipeline: <span class="p">This 1,331 km long pipeline is proposed to be constructed for transporting crude oil to the proposed refinery at Bhatinda.
