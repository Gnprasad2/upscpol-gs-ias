Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM)</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The planned development of irrigation sector started in a big way since the First Five Year Plan (1951–56). New projects were taken up in the Second Five Year Plan, the Third Five Year Plan, and the Annual Plans 1966–69. During the Fourth Five Year Plan emphasis was shifted to the completion of ongoing schemes.</p><p class="s100" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s16">The widening gap between potential creation and utilization was felt in the Fifth Plan (1974– 78)</span></p><p class="s100" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s16">and accordingly Command Area Development programme (CADP) was launched as a Centrally-</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_430.png"/></span></p><p class="s100" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"> <span class="s16">sponsored scheme in 1974-75.</span><span class="p"> The CADP is an integrated area development approach towards the command areas of major and medium irrigation projects in the country. The programme is aimed at bridging the gap between created irrigation potential and its utilization in the command area.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The CAD programme was initially introduced in the Indira Gandhi Canal Command Area in 1974. Up to March 1998 the total number of projects taken up for command area development increased to 217 with cultivable command area (CCA) of 21.78 million hectares and spreading over 23 states and 2 union territories.</p><p class="s100" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s16">This programme was restructured and renamed as Command Area Development and Water</span></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s100"> </span><u>Management (CADWM) Programme since April 1, 2004</u>. The scheme is now being implemented as a State sector scheme during the XI Five Year Plan (2008-09 to 2011-12). During the XII Plan, the Scheme is to be implemented <i>pari-passu </i>with Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP).<u> The total proposed outlay for the XII Plan (Central share) is Rs.15,000 crore to cover about</u></p><p class="s100" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"> <span class="s16">7.6 Mha.</span></p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Programme involves execution of on- farm development works like construction of Field channels and Fields drains, land leveling and shaping and conjunctive use of surface and ground- water. Warabandi or the rotational system of water distribution is undertaken with a view to ensuring equitable and timely supply of water to the farmers. Attention is also given to diversification of crore pattern so that water is put to optimum use and productivity of land increased. During such diversion Frication emphasis would be given to the production of oil seeds, pulses etc to eliminate as far as possible their shortage.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Under the CAD programme, the Ministry of Water Resources is also introducing and promoting participatory irrigation management (discussed below) in the CAD Projects by creating awareness and providing financial assistance to farmers&#39; associations. Reclamation of waterlogged areas in irrigated commands is also an important component of the Programme.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">An area of about 20.149 Mha has been covered under the programme since inception up to end of March, 2012.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part659.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part661.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
