IT and Indian Agriculture in the Future</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Technologically it is possible to develop suitable systems, as outlined in the previous sections, to cater to the information needs of Indian farmer. User friendly systems, particularly with content in local languages, can generate interest in the farmers and others working at the grassroots. It is possible to create dedicated networks or harnesses the powers of Internet to make these services are available to all parts of the country.</p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The task of creating application packages and databases to cater  to complete spectrum of Indian agriculture is a giant task. The Long Term Agriculture Policy provides an exhaustive list of all the areas that are to be covered. This can be taken as a guiding list to evolve design and develop suitable systems catering to each of the specified areas. Our country has the advantage of having a large number of specialised institutions in place catering to various aspects of Indian agriculture. These institutions can play a crucial role in designing the necessary applications &amp; databases and services. This will facilitate modularisation of the task, better control and help in achieving quick results. As it is, several institutions have already developed systems related to their area of specialisation. For quick results, it may be useful to get the applications outsourced to software companies in India. This will facilitate quick deployment of applications and provide boost to the software industry in India. In order to avoid duplication of efforts, it may be useful to consider promoting a coordinating agency which will have an advisory role to play in evolving standard interface for users, broad design and monitoring of the progress.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the post WTO regime, it is suggested that it is useful to focus more on some agricultural products to maintain an unquestionable competitive advantage for exports. This will call for urgent measures to introduce state of the art technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems (GIS), bio-engineering, etc. India has made rapid strides in satellite technologies. It is possible to effectively monitor agricultural performance using remote sensing and GIS applications. This will not only help in planning, advising and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">monitoring the status of the crops but also will help in responding quickly to crop stress conditions and natural calamities. Challenges of crop stress, soil problems, natural disasters can be tackled effectively through these technologies. A beginning in precision farming can be encouraged in larger tracts of land in which export potential can be tilted in our countryâ€™s favour.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">While developing these systems it is necessary to appreciate that major audience that is targeted is not comfortable with computers. This places premium on user friendliness and it may be useful to consider touch screen technologies to improve user comfort levels. It is often observed that touch screen kiosks, with their intuitive approach, provide a means for quick learning and higher participation. It is also necessary to provide as much content as possible in local languages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_635.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Once the required application packages &amp; databases are in place, a major challenge is with respect to dissemination of the information. The Krishi Vigyan Kendras, NGOs and cooperative societies may be used to set up information kiosks. Private enterprise is also required to be drawn into these activities. These kiosks should provide information on other areas of interest such as education, information for which people have to travel distances such as those related to the government, courts, etc. Facilities for email, raising queries to experts, uploading digital clips to draw the attention of experts to location specific problems can be envisaged.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part1001.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part1003.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
