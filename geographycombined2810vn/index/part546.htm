But the Arakan Hills along the coast of Myanmar deflect a big portion of this branch towards the Indian subcontinent. <u>The monsoon, therefore, enters West Bengal and Bangladesh from south</u> <u>and southeast instead of from the south-westerly direction.</u> From here, this branch splits into two under the influence of the Himalayas and the thermal low is northwest India.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s11">⧫</span><span class="s12"> </span>One branch moves westward along the <b>Ganga plains </b>reaching as far as the Punjab plains.</p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s11">⧫</span><span class="s12"> </span>The other branch <b>moves up the Brahmaputra valley </b>in the north and the northeast, causing widespread rains.

The path of these depressions also keeps changing with the position of the ITCZ, also known as <b>monsoon trough </b>(Figure – position of Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the month of January and July). As the axis of the monsoon trough oscillates with the apparent movement of sun between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, there are fluctuations in the track and direction of these depressions, and the intensity and the amount of rainfall vary from year to year. The amount of rainfall in north India varies with the frequency of the tropical depressions. On an average, one to three depressions are observed every month and the life span of one depression is about one week [4].</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The rain which comes in spells, displays a declining trend from west to east over the west coast, and from the southeast towards the northwest over the North Indian Plain and the northern part of the Peninsula. Rajasthan desert receives low rainfall in spite of being in the path of Arabian Sea branch of monsoon. This branch blows parallel to Aravalis mountain chain without obstruction and thus, does not release moisture here.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part545.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part547.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
