OF INDIA. It was set up in 1767 to help consolidate the territories of the British East India Company. In its assigned role as the National Principal Mapping Agency, Survey of India bears a special responsibility to ensure that the country’s domain is explored and mapped suitably to provide base maps for expeditious and integrated development and ensure that all resources contribute their full measure to the progress, prosperity and security of India.</p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Besides being grouped under ‘‘Scientific Surveys’’ in Government of India Business Rule 1971, it has  also been called  upon  extensively to deploy its expertise in the field of geodetic and geophysical surveys, study of seismicity and seismotectonics, glaciology, participation in Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica and projects related to digital cartography and digital photogrammetry, etc., to provide basic data to keep pace with Science and Technology Development.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Botanical Survey of India (BSI), Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) are some other important surveying agencies of government of India.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The land-use categories as maintained in the Land Revenue Records1 are as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><b>(i) Forests</b>: According  to Survey of India report, <i>forest area </i>is one that is <b>notified by the department </b>as land under forests, <b>irrespective of whether it has any tree </b><i><b>cover </b></i><b>or not</b>. The land under <i><b>forest cover </b></i>is the land <b>exceeding one hectare </b>area having a minimum of 10 per cent tree <i>cover irrespective </i>of any other land-use. Thus, the area under actual forest cover may be different from area classified as forest. Hence, there may be an increase in this category without any increase in the actual forest cover.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(ii) Land put to Non-agricultural Uses: <span class="p">This includes the part of the geographic area that is put to non-agricultural uses like settlements, </span>both rural and urban<span class="p">, infrastructure development like roads, railway lines, canals, industries, shops and other similar uses.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_437.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 <span class="s18">As per the records of Land Revenue Department</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(iii) Barren and Wastelands: <span class="p">The land classified as a wasteland such as barren hilly terrains, desert lands, ravines, etc. are normally can not be brought under cultivation with the available technology. They remain non suitable for agriculture and generally remain fallow.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(iv) Area under Permanent Pastures and Grazing Lands: <span class="p">The above type land is generally owned by the village ‘Panchayat’ or the Government (Forest &amp; Revenue Department). Only a small proportion of this land is privately owned. These lands are not used for cultivation. The land owned by the village panchayat comes under ‘Common Property Resources’. The benefits of this land accrue to the members of the community as a whole.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_438.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(v) Area under Miscellaneous Tree Crops and Groves: <span class="p">These areas are not included in net sown area. The land under orchards and fruit trees is included in this category. Most of this land is privately owned by the people.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(vi) Culturable Waste-Land: <span class="p">Any land which is left </span>fallow <span class="p">(uncultivated) for more than </span>five years <span class="p">is categorised as a culturable wasteland. This land may be marshy, saline land having degraded soil on account of soil erosion or under dense bushes. Such land can be brought under cultivation after improving it through reclamation practices.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(vii) Current Fallow: <span class="p">The land which has been left without cultivation for </span>one or less than one agricultural year <span class="p">is known as current fallow. The practise adopted for giving rest to the culturable land is called fallowing. The land recoups the lost fertility through natural processes in the time duration.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(viii) Fallow other than Current Fallow: <span class="p">These are also the cultivable land  which are left uncultivated for </span>more than a year<span class="p">. The duration for which the land has been left uncultivated should be less than five years. Most of  this land is either of poor  quality or the cost of cultivation of such land is very high. If the land is left uncultivated for more than five years, it would be categorised as culturable wasteland.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part669.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part671.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
