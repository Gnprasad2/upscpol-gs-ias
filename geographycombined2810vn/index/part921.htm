Concept of Development and Indian aspects</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is believed that “Development is freedom” which is often associated with modernisation, leisure, comfort and affluence<b>. In the present context, computerisation, industrialisation, efficient transport and communication network, large education system, advanced and modern medical facilities, safety and security of individuals, etc. are considered as the symbols of development. </b>Every individual, community and government measures its performance or levels of development in relation to the availability and access to some of these things. But, this may be partial and one-sided view of development. <b>It is often called the western or euro-centric view of development</b>. <b>For a postcolonial country like India, colonisation, marginalisation, social discrimination and regional disparity, etc. show the other face of development.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, for India, development is a mixed bag of opportunities as well as neglect and deprivations. There are a few areas like the metropolitan centres and other developed enclaves that have all the modern facilities available to a small section of its population. At the other extreme of it, there are large rural areas and the slums in the urban areas that do not have basic amenities like potable water, education and health infrastructure available to majority of this population.</p> <p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The situation is more alarming if one looks at the distribution of the development opportunities among different sections of our society<span class="p">. It is a well-established fact that majority of the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, landless agricultural labourers, poor farmers and slums dwellers, etc. are the most marginalised lot. A large segment of female population is the worst sufferers among all. It is also equally true that the relative as well as absolute conditions of the majority of these marginalised sections have worsened with the development happening over the years. Consequently, vast majority of people are compelled to live under abject poverty and subhuman conditions.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part920.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part922.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
