This time Peninsular rivers also have sufficient water. While the water availability in the southern rivers may be increased, the main reason why such project is not being put to implementation is the apprehension of future water shortage in the Northern plains as a result of Climate change, whose effects are now not known. Shifting huge quantity of water would have affect on heat balance of Indian subcontinent which may affect monsoon pattern and intensity also. It will also affect the temperature and salinity of Bay of Bengal water near Bengal region.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">NDA government&#39;s proposal of river interlinking met with stiff opposition from several quarters. The Supreme Court cleared the river-linking project. A group of citizens has filed review petition in the Supreme Court. Recent report of planning commission also does not support the project due to environmental and monsoon issues. Rivers linkage crosses political boundaries of states. Consensus among states is another challenge.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Linkage at small scale is feasible and few links of this river projects are under analysis or under construction. For instance, many links in Gujarat are connected. Five Peninsular links namely (i) Ken – Betwa, (ii) Parbati – Kalisindh – Chambal, (iii) Damanganga – Pinjal, (iv) Par – Tapi – Narmada &amp; (v) Godavari (Polavaram) - Krishna (Vijayawada) have been identified as priority links for taking up their Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) by ministry of water resources in 2012. DPR of one priority link namely Ken-Betwa has been completed and was communicated to the party states. Solution envisaged in the 12thfive year plan is the water management. Locally available water needs to be managed with proper conservation techniques and by use of best available technologies in agriculture, industry with full incentive to be given for recycling of water.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part314.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part316.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
