The central government launched a series of economic and social reforms in 1991 under Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. Under the new policies the government allowed private and foreign broadcasters to engage in limited operations in India. This process has been pursued consistently by all subsequent federal administrations. Foreign channels like CNN, STAR TV and private domestic channels such as Zee TV, ETV and Sun TV started satellite broadcasts. Starting with 41 sets in 1992 and one channel, by 1995, TV in India covered more than 70 million homes giving a viewing population of more than 400 million individuals through more than 100 channels.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There are <i>five basic types of television </i>in India: broadcast or &quot;over-the-air&quot; television, unencrypted satellite or &quot;free-to-air&quot;, Direct-to-Home (DTH), cable television, and IPTV. Over- the-air and free-to-air TV is free with no monthly payments while Cable, DTH, and IPTV require a monthly payment that varies depending on how many channels a subscriber chooses to pay for. Channels are usually sold in groups or <i>a la carte</i>. All television service providers are required by law to provide a la carte selection of channels.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part864.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part866.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
