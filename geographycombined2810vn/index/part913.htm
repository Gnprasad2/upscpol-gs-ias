The oil refining technology was developed in United States of America, Europe and former USSR. Earlier the refineries were generally located near the oil wells. The petrochemical industry developed in Europe and United States of America after the Second World War. <b>The development of large tankers and pipelines facilitated the transportation of petroleum in bulk and this provided favourable conditions for locating the refineries and petro-chemical industries near the markets as well as ports.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_589.png"/></span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3.2.1.

The refineries located on the East Coast get crude oil from Venezuela and West Asia.
