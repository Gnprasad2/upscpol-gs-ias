It is also about increasing the ability and accountability of individuals and institutions that are responsible for protecting and fulfilling those rights. A rights-based approach to social policy implies institutions and policies that can guarantee people reasonable access to a ‘social minimum’ i.e. to fulfill basic needs like food, shelter, work, etc. As the socio- economic condition improves, the ‘minimum’ also changes.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In recent past, ‘Rights’ have been identified with good governance, and political and bureaucratic efforts to improve administration are often defined in terms of expanding rights of the citizens on the government. Further, pressure groups like Civil Society, donor agencies (UN bodies) and others, as well as Supreme Court’s wider interpretation of Fundamental Rights have ensured a more inclusive approach to public policy making especially with regard to rights of the vulnerable.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With increasing knowledge, awareness, social capital and support of domestic and international civil society, certain rights have come to be regarded as basic obligations on the state rather than luxuries that could be delayed in the name of capability of the state. The ‘basic minimum’ Rights are no more a state patronage, rather they are its duties. The following measures undertaken can be considered as various aspects of rights based approach:-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">Constitutional status to PRIs (grassroots, participative democracy)</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">Adoption of Right to Information (extracting transparency and accountability), Right to Education (to build human capital), Right to Food (through National Food Security Act), Formulating a National Health Mission, etc.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">Adoption of Right to Public Service Acts by many States to give timely delivery of services to people.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">Social Audit of government programmes</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Importance of Rights-based approach in improving public service delivery</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">Clear identification of rights, their holders and enforcers improves accountability.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">Vulnerable can be targeted and offenders can be prosecuted with better understanding and awareness about rights.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s10"> </span><span class="p">Helps in building capacities, capabilities and infrastructure for the realization and enforcement of rights.
