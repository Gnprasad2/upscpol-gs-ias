Role of NGOs in Development</h3><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"   src="Image_075.png"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In developing countries India, there are numerous gaps left by the government in the development process. These gaps are filled by NGOs.</p><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Work where state is unwilling to work</span><span class="s39">: For example, caste is an issue that no government wants to fiddle with. The persistence of caste hierarchy suits the vote banks for the politicians. In the process, laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of caste are often ignored unless there is an NGO working in the area that is willing to take up the cause of those being discriminated against.</span></p><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Work where state resources are inadequate</span><span class="s39">: Two main such area include education and healthcare. There are not enough government run schools or hospitals, especially in rural areas. Even if they are present, they do not have resources. The NGOs try to complement and complete these initiatives. The mammoth NGO called Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad is largely credited for the hundred percent literacy rate in that state.</span></p><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Fighting social evils</span><span class="s39">: It is due to the efforts of NGOs that the government has banned sex determination of foetus as it leads to evils like abortion of female fetus.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p class="s43" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Right to Shelter</span><span class="s39">: NGOs such as YUVA and SPARC in cities like Mumbai have repeatedly opposed the demolition of hutments even as they try to improve the quality of life in the sprawling slum clusters</span></p><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Right to Information</span><span class="s39">: It is because of the efforts of NGOs that RTI has become reality in India.</span></p><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Tribal Rights</span><span class="s39">: As witnessed in the Vedanta vs. Posco case, NGOs have raised voice against the discrimination of tribal by the multinationals. Many of these NGOs have partnered with Gram Panchayat in proper implementation of acts like Forest Rights Act, CAMPA Act etc.</span></p><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Community Development</span><span class="s39">: Local, national and regional NGOs have emerged as major players and partners in development activities in the region. At the community level, they are in the front line in providing assistance in the acquisition of basic needs and amenities; in identifying issues, raising awareness, and in articulating the communities’ problems.</span></p><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Rehabilitation</span><span class="s39">: NGOs did remarkable job post 2004 Tsunami. Besides helping in rescue operations, NGOs also set up vocational training centers.</span></p><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s44"> </span><span class="s42">Implementation of welfare schemes</span><span class="s39">: NGOs due to proximity to general public, work as interface between government and the end users. Thus NGOs play three roles of implementer, a catalyst and a partner in the implementation of government welfare schemes.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part176.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part178.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script></body></html>
