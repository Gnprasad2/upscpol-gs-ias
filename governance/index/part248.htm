In India, policy making is done at director and above level.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;"></p> <p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But the most important level i.e. crucial for consideration of cross-cutting impacts is that of the Secretaries. Also officers are more comfortable with implementation matters than with policy making. This results in sub-optimal policies, where adequate attention has not been paid to citizen needs.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10"> </span><span class="s1">Over-centralization: </span><span class="p">In India, there is excessive concentration of implementation powers at the higher levels of the Ministries.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s9"></span><span class="s10"> </span>Lack of non-governmental inputs and informed debates: <span class="p">The best expertise in many sectors lies outside the Government. Yet the policy processes and structures of Government have no systematic means for obtaining outside inputs</span>.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10"> </span><span class="s1">Lack of systematic analysis and integration prior to policy making: </span><span class="p">Policy decisions are often made without adequate analysis of costs, benefits, trade-offs and consequences. There is a  school of  thought which  suggests that the excessive involvement of  poorly informed generalists is the main cause of poor policy-making and implementation.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10"> </span><span class="s1">Lack of evidence based research: </span><span class="p">Most of the times, policy formulation is carried out by few senior bureaucrats and politicians who are not aware of prevailing ground realities. There is no prior field study or survey is done to take macro as well as micro view of ground realities.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10"> </span><span class="s1">Politically motivated policies: </span><span class="p">At times, electoral considerations dominate the aims and objectives of a policy. Frequent loan waiver by different states in India is one such example.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Loan waiver is poor economic policy. It creates moral hazard for the farmers and puts banking sector under stress.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s10"> </span><span class="s1">Lack of imagination</span><span class="p">: Public policy-making in India has frequently been characterized by a failure to anticipate needs, impacts, or reactions which could have reasonably been foreseen, thus impeding economic development. Policies have been reversed or changed more frequently than warranted by exogenous changes or new information.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part247.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part249.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=googleTranslateElementInit"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/js/materialize.min.js"></script></body></html>
