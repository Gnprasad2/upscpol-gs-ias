Region</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The term region is difficult to define. It is understood in different ways in different contexts. However, it has been generally defined as “<b>a homogeneous area with physical and cultural characteristics distinct from those of neighboring areas”.</b></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A region is a relative term, the meaning of which changes with its usage. When we talk of a region, what we generally imply is that it is socio-culturally distinct and that it is sufficiently unified to have a consciousness of its customs, traditions, values and ideals. Because of this consciousness the people of the region possess a sense of identity distinct from the rest of the regions be it a nation or a continent or the earth itself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_036.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A region is characterized by a widely shared sense of togetherness among the people. This togetherness results from a wide variety of sources like geography, topography, religion, language, customs and mores, political and economic stage of development, way of living, commonly shared historical experiences, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Region provides the basis for the emergence of <b>regional identity</b>. It results in loyalty towards the region and ultimately takes the shape and form of regionalism. It gives way to regional politics.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>politics of regionalism </b>in India has both positive and negative aspects. Speaking in positive terms, it implies an intense desire for concretizing an identity based on such interest as ethnic, language, religion, etc. For example, the erstwhile Jharkhand movement which covered wide regions of Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, had come together as a unified group to protect and promote their socio-economic and political interests. This process involves reaffirming their identity as tribal groups. The movement finally succeeded in forcing the government in reorganizing the states and the formation of Jharkhand State came about on 15th November 2000 as the 28th State of the Indian Union. It has been carved out of the State of Bihar and it largely comprises forest tracks of Chhotanagpur plateau and Santhal Paragana.</p> <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The <b>negative aspects </b>of regionalism is that it can threaten nation-building efforts such as, the demand for Khalistan in Punjab which is giving rise to terrorism and violence within and outside Punjab. The positive aspect has been ignored by most of the analysts of Indian political situation. This phenomenon reflects the psychology of relative deprivation  on the part of people of an area. They point out that deprivation is deliberately inflicted on them by those in power, particularly when socio-economic programmes have resulted in wide economic disparities among various regions. This has led to discontentment and agitation among the backward or not so developed regions of the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The concept of region is therefore, closely linked with the concept of regionalism. Now let us see what regionalism means.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Regionalism: <span class="p">Regionalism can be defined as a phenomenon in which people’s political loyalties become focused upon a region. In other words, it implies people’s love of a particular region in preference to the country and in certain cases in preference to the state of which the region is a part. Thus the phenomenon of regionalism is centered around the concept of region.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Regionalism in India is rooted in India’s diversity of languages, cultures, tribes, and religions. It is also encouraged by the geographical concentration  of these identity markers in particular regions, and fuelled by a sense of regional deprivation. Indian federalism has been a means of accommodating these regional sentiments.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part94.htm">1.1.
