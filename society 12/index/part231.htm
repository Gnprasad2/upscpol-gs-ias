This is in contrast to the discussions on environment conservation in developed countries which often revolves around the issues of quality of life, animal rights etc.</p> <p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">⧫</span><span class="s7"> </span>Women have direct contact with natural resources like <b>fuel, food and fodder, forest, water </b>and <b>land </b>especially in rural areas where 70% of Indian population reside and directly dependent upon natural resources. Women are also responsible for using these resources to satisfy the basic needs of their families.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">⧫</span><span class="s7"> </span>Women have given <b>different perspective to the environmental issues </b>due to their different experience base. They view the issue in a broad and holistic manner aiming at long term benefits of subsistence and survival as against short term commercial gains.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Therefore, conservation of natural resources and promotion of environment cannot be done without involving the women in planning and training for promoting the values for conservation and promotion of environment.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">⧫</span><span class="s7"> </span>The emergence of the Indian environmental movement can perhaps be dated to 1973, when the famous <b>Chipko movement </b>began in the central Himalayas. The Chipko movement emerged as a protest against granting of permission for access to the forests to commercial timber operators, while the local people were refused access to the forests for making agricultural implements.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">The movement which spread rapidly to other villages saw the active involvement of women. They worked jointly with the men of their community, and in some cases even against them, when they differed with them over the use of forest resources. Women were more concerned with the long-term gain of saving the forests and environment, and hence, subsistence and survival issues, rather than short-term gain through commercial projects like monoculture forests, potato-seed farms, etc.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">The scope of the movement broadened and involved issues of male alcoholism,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">domestic violence, women’s representation in village councils, as well as against</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mining in the hills. It helped women recognize the inter-connections between nature and human sustenance. The movement was carried forward largely by women <b>using Gandhian techniques of protest</b>.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">⧫</span><span class="s7"> </span>It was just the beginning, which was followed by several other movements such as <b>Green Belt movement in 1977 (planting trees), Appiko movement (hugging the trees) , Narmada Bachao Aandolan etc</b>. which saw significant participation of women at all levels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_094.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">⧫</span><span class="s7"> </span>We need to analyze women’ s interaction with nature and their responses to environmental degradation with respect to the <b>material reality of gender, caste, class and race based division of labor, property and power</b>. It is the poor, lower class and lower caste, and within them, the peasant and tribal women, who are worst, affected and hence, they are the most active in the protests. Women are victims of environmental degradation as well as active agents in the regeneration and protection of the environment. The adverse class-gender effects of these processes are reflected in the erosion of indigenous knowledge systems and livelihood strategies on which poor, rural women depend.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">The history of environmental movements in India shows that women have bear the major brunt of environmental degradation &amp; hence have also been the first ones to spearhead conservation movements from Chipko to the Narmada Bachao Andolan.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">⧫</span><span class="s7"> </span>Moreover the strong connection between women and the issues of the environment led to the emergence of the concept of <b>ecofeminism</b>. The term which grew out of the various social movements that were occurring all over the world <b>involves the concept of feminism, peace and the ecology and signifies the role of women in environmental conservation.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part230.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part232.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
