In fact India’s quest for population stabilization began in 1951 with the formulation of the first five year plan. Yet more than 60 years goals remain elusive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_180.png"/></span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">In India, there has not been an effective institutionalized mechanism to reduce birth rate. On the other hand, efforts to bring down the death rate have been quite successful. Improvement in conditions of health and hygiene has lowered the death rate. The family planning movement gains national importance in such a situation of imbalance development and population growth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s7"> </span>Hence, the government for the first time formulated a policy<b>( effort to regulate economic and social conditions which are likely to have demographic consequences) </b>in <b>1976</b>, with an aim to decrease birth rate, legalize abortion, check the concentration of population, giving incentives and disincentives. But it <b>boomeranged because of its coerciveness, overzealous attitude and compulsory sterilization</b>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s7"> </span>Further, the government with a revived approach to fight the menace of population growth introduced the <b>national population policy in 2000</b>. It aimed at achieving the objective of stable population by 2045, at a level consistent with the requirement of sustainable economic growth, social development and environmental protection. Its objective was to address the needs for contraception, healthcare, infrastructure and health personnel and to provide integrated service delivery for basic reproductive and child health care. The policy had set goals for 2010 with respect to IMR, MMR, TFR, institutional deliveries etc. but it failed to achieve these targets.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">The reasons for the failure were lack of political will, lack of responsive policy, lack of awareness, cultural inertia etc. hence government came up with the revised population policy in 2010.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">The aim of the national policy was to impress upon the people the need for small, planned families for their own good as well as for the wellbeing of their children. The 20 point programme envisages family planning on voluntary basis as a people’s movement. What is needed to inculcate awareness among the people through the media and oral communication about the significance of the small family norm. Female literacy and education can play a decisive role in bringing down the rate of population growth.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s7"> </span>The following suggestions have been put forward to <b>curb population growth</b>:</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">o <span class="p">Group acceptance of small sized family.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">o <span class="p">Personal knowledge about family planning methods.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">o <span class="p">Ready availability of birth control devices and services.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s7"> </span>Hence, the crux of the population policy is the reduction of the national birth rate; irrespective of social, cultural and economic milieu. Coercing people to adopt family planning methods has not worked. <b>Volition alone, created through awakening, can be an effective measure</b>.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part333.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part335.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
