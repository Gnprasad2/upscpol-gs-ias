Constitutional Provisions and Social Legislation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_073.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Constitution of independent India followed the basic principle of women’s equality as accepted in the Fundamental Rights Resolution of the Karachi Congress. The provision of Article 15(3), which empowered the state to make special provisions for women and children, suggests that there was a realization of women’s disadvantaged position and the need for the state to enact special measures to bring them at par with men.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">During freedom movement it was felt that with the nation’s Independence would disappear many of the disabilities, and problems of women attributed to colonial rule. The national government undertook to remove the legal disabilities suffered by women and initiated major reforms in Hindu family laws. The legal reforms in the 1950s sought to provide greater rights to Hindu women in marriage, inheritance and guardianship. However, they failed to bridge the gap between legal and social realities. Similar changes in the family laws of other communities like Muslims, Christians, Parsis and Jews, have not yet come up due to political resistance despite the Directive Principle of State Policy clearly stating the need for uniform laws for all the communities.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With these legislative measures in the fifties women’s organisation became passive and lost the vigour shown during the pre-Independence period. Several of these organisations received government grants and their activities were shaped by the grants they received for activities like adult education, nutrition programmes for children, tailoring classes under vocational training programmes and family planning programmes. Most of these organisations were urban based and the leadership came from the educated middle and upper class women.</p> <p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the post-Independence period, two important organisations for rural women were set up, i.e., Kasturba Memorial Trust and Bharatiya Grameen Mahila Sangh(Indian Rural Women’s Organisation). Their main objective was to assist the rural women in developing leadership potential.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part177.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part179.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
