It has helped Indian consumers to enjoy all high Quality global brands. It did help Government of India to tide over its serious foreign exchange problem, though temporarily, by enabling it to get loan from World Bank. But critics cite serious erosion of control of Indian Government over its economy and the loss to local Industry as setbacks.</p>  <p  style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">7.1. Impact of Globalization on Employment in India </p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Globalization affects the employment situation through trade liberalisation, through encouraging exports and imports and through increasing incentives for investment and innovation. It also encourages FDI which supplements domestic investment and leads to higher growth of the economy. Globalization, which is often combined with domestic liberalisation, also results in reducing the power of trade unions and encourages informal contractualization and lock outs.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No wonder, the advocates of globalization have always been of the firm view that globalization would result in significant increases in labour intensive exports thereby promoting employment and income generation in developing countries. Simultaneously, larger flows of FDI would result in increased investment in Greenfield areas and would lead to accelerated direct and indirect employment and income growth in the developing countries.</p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In the Indian context of post economic reforms, the rate of growth of the economy and the rate of growth of employment have accelerated, but the economy as also employment remains undiversified. Both interpersonal and inter-regional income inequalities remain high and seem to have increased. The quality of employment remains very poor for a major portion of workers. The following points may be noted in Indian context:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3">⧫</span><span class="s4"> </span>Globalization has resulted in <b>casualization of labour. </b>Global competition tends to encourage formal firms to shift formal wageworkers to informal employment arrangements without minimum wages, assured work or benefits. It encourages informal units to shift workers to piece-rate or casual work arrangements without assured minimum wages, or benefits.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s4"> </span><span class="p">Real wages of casual labour increased faster than in the past- both among agricultural and industrial workers.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s3">⧫</span><span class="s4"> </span>There has been a <b>shift in the composition of labour force in favour of the skilled labors</b>, in general, and more significantly in the unorganised sector.
