Reproductive health can also address issues such as harmful practices, unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, reproductive tract infections including sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence, infertility, malnutrition and anemia, and reproductive tract cancers.</p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In India, the <b>Reproductive and Child Health Programme</b>, was launched in <b>1997</b>.Its aim was to integrate services for the prevention and management of unwanted pregnancy, the promotion of safe motherhood and child survival, and the prevention and management of reproductive tract infections and sexually transmitted infections. The programme aimed at expanding services to meet the needs of hitherto under-served and neglected population groups, including adolescents, and economically and socially disadvantaged groups, such as urban slum and tribal populations.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How this concept is different from existing family planning and maternal and child health programmes:</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">The objectives, design and evaluation of family planning programmes were largely driven by a demographic imperative, without due consideration to related health issues such as maternal health or STD prevention and management.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">In general, such programmes exclusively targeted women, taking little account of the social, cultural and intimate realities of their reproductive lives and decision- making powers.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">They tended to serve only married people, excluding, in particular, young people.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Services were rarely designed to serve men even though they have reproductive health concerns of their own, particularly with regard to sexually transmitted diseases.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Hence, a reproductive health approach would differ from a narrow family planning approach in several ways. It would aim to build upon what exists and at the same time to modify current narrow, vertical programmes to ones in which every opportunity is taken to offer women and men a full range of reproductive health services in a linked way.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part329.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part331.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
