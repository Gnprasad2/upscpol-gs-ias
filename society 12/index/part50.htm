On top of this, there is limited capacity among officials and lack of willingness to go against community decisions, since officials are themselves part of the community.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In communities where a dowry or ‘bride price’ is paid, it is often welcome income for poor families; in those where the bride’s family pay the groom a dowry, they often have to pay less money if the bride is young and uneducated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_020.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Many parents marry off their daughters young  because they feel it is in  her  best interest, often to ensure her safety in areas where girls are at high risk of physical or sexual assault. Limited education opportunities, low quality of education, inadequate infrastructure, lack of transport and therefore concerns about girls’ safety while travelling to school significantly contribute to keeping girls out of school and therefore tend to favour child marriage.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Girls are often seen as a liability with limited economic role. Women’s work is confined to the household and is not valued. Archaic laws such as those of Muslim Personal Law allows the marriage of girls aged between 15 and 18.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Child marriage ensues the vicious cycle of poverty. With little access to education and economic opportunities, they and their families are more likely to live in poverty. Child brides are often disempowered, dependent on their husbands and deprived of their fundamental rights to health, education and safety. A system that undervalues the contribution of young women limits its own possibilities. In this way, child marriage drains country of the innovation and potential that would enable them to thrive.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part49.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part51.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
