In India, communalism arises when <b>religion is used as a marker to highlight socio-economic disequilibrium </b>between communities and as a force multiplier to demand concessions.</p> <p class="s5" style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">♤  </span><span class="s7"> </span>Improper cultural synthesis<span class="p">, </span>perceived or relative deprivation<span class="p">, </span>regional or social imbalance <span class="p">in development and </span>lack of opportunities <span class="p">may be pointed out as the reason for the genesis of communalism</span>.

Communalism in India has its beginnings in the British policy of ‘<b>divide and rule’. </b>A prominent reason why this policy gained currency was that the Muslim middle class had lagged behind the Hindus in terms of education, which contributed to their <b>low representation in government jobs</b>. Due <b>to lack of enough economic opportunities </b>at that time, a government job was highly coveted by the middle classes. Moreover, the <b>post-1857 anti</b>-<b>Muslim bias </b>of the British also gave a slight edge to the Hindus, who took to modern enterprises/professions with great keenness. As a result, the demand for a separate nation of Pakistan got the fervor due to marked inequalities in socio- economic indicators including representation in the seats of power.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">♤  </span><span class="s7"> </span>The first so-called communal clash during colonial rule was the <b>Mappila Rebellion</b>, which was more of a proletarian strike against the landed gentry than a communal riot. It only so happened that the landed gentry were Hindus and the peasants were Muslims.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6">♤  </span><span class="s7"> </span>Hence a <b>stagnant secularization process </b>(involving separation of religion and politics) due to: (1<b>) Slow development of economy, (2) Competition between Hindu and Muslim elite (3) Weak mercantile bourgeoisie vis-a-vis feudal lords, (4) British policy of divide-and rule </b>led to growth of communalism in pre- independence era.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s16">Post-independence</span><span class="p">, things did not change much for Muslims, which was well substantiated with the findings of Sachar committee report.
