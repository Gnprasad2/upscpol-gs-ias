A notable revolution has occurred in the telecom sector. In the pre reforms era, this was entirely in the hands of the central  government and  due to lack of  competition, the call  charges were quite high. Further, due to lack of funds with the government, the government could never meet the demand for telephones. In fact, a person seeking a telephone connection had to wait for years before he could get a telephone connection.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">The biggest contribution of  globalisation is in  the field  of quality and  development of products with various features to suit the Indians.

Globalization has increased the demand for education due to the economic payoffs of higher education to global, science based, knowledge. University training has become more of a necessity to get good job in a globalized world. Moreover, socio-political, demographic and democratic ideals increase pressure on universities to provide access to groups that traditionally have not attended universities. Opening Indian higher education to foreign competition will benefit education sector further.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">In theory, globalisation, by promoting economic growth in developing countries, tends to reduce poverty Some scholars have argued that ‘ trade is good for growth, growth is good for the poor and so trade is good for the poor’ (Dollar and Kray, 2001). The empirical experience of developing countries generally supports this proposition as the incidence of poverty declined significantly in many fast growing countries like China, India and Vietnam. However, some critics have argued that the reduction of poverty in China was only because of its exceptional growth—in fact, absolute poverty increased in Sub-Saharan Africa and relative poverty has increased in a majority of countries.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Globalization has through greater exposure liberalized our attitudes, reduced our biases and predispositions about people, situations and communities worldwide.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part470.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part472.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
