Existing schools with inadequate teacher strength are provided with additional teachers, while the capacity of existing teachers is being strengthened by extensive training, grants for developing teaching-learning materials and strengthening of the academic support structure at a cluster, block and district level. SSA seeks to provide quality elementary education including life skills. SSA has a special focus on girl&#39;s education and children with special needs. SSA also seeks to provide computer education to bridge the digital divide.</p><p class="s54" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Performance Evaluation of SSA</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Significant reduction in the number of out-of-school children on account of SSA interventions has been noted.
