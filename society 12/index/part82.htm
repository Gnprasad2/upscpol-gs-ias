Measures to address the problem of communalism:</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The problem of communalism in India is grave and can have far-reaching consequences. Thus, persuasive as well as punitive measures are required to curb its spread.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Building solidarity and assimilation of various religious groups at different levels in society- workplace, neighborhood etc. by fostering a secular culture eg. celebrating each other’s religious festivals.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Swift and prompt response to radicalization by a militant group on social media through police action, counselling sessions for those radicalized especially adolescents etc.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Ensuring that political parties refrain from using religion, religious ideologies in order to garner votes through strict vigilance by institutional mechanisms such as the Election Commission, media, civil society etc.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Instances of an inter-religious marriage of two consenting adults should not be construed as “love jihad issue” and highlighted in the media. Thus, media persons should be sensitized regarding the issue.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_031.png"/></span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Mobs leading communal riots should be controlled and strict action should be taken against them as a combative measure.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Stern law should be framed by the Parliament against communal violence. The weaknesses of laws have resulted in escape of politicians and other influential persons who have openly indulged in inciting communal violence.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">The CBI or a special investigative body should investigate communal riots within a stipulated time frame. Further, special courts should hear such cases for quick delivery of justice to victims.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s25"> </span><span class="s26">Police and other bodies upholding law and order should be held accountable as sometimes the police bow down to pressure from politicians and remain inactive during communal violence and in the course of its follow up eg. while filing FIRs, arresting the accused, producing charge sheets etc. Thus, legal reforms must be introduced which hold them accountable for swift action.</span></p> <p class="s24" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s25"> </span><span class="s26">Pluralistic settlement where members of different communities live together should be encouraged by removing existing barriers as religious segregation strengthens communal identities and reinforces negative stereotypes of other religious groups. Eg. taking action during instances of intolerance where Muslims, Dalits, North-Eastern citizens etc. are denied housing owing to their identities. Sachar Committee report on the status of Indian Muslims recommended the creation of an Equal Opportunities Commission to deal with complaints of intolerance and exclusion.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s25"> </span><span class="s26">Secular education should be taught in all educational institutions, which will led to development of harmony and co-operation among members of different communities.</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s25"> </span><span class="s26">History education should be de-communalized as the present categorization of Indian history into ancient, medieval and modern has contributed to communal thinking as it has effectively divided history into the Hindu period, Muslim period and Christian period respectively.  This has  given  rise to notions that India  was a  Hindu  country which  was ‘invaded’ by Muslims and Christians.</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s28"> </span><span class="s29">Increased  employment opportunities for  minorities can lead to decrease in  communal discord. Thus, there should be focus on skilling members of minority communities through various programmes and initiatives.</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s28"> </span><span class="s29">Religious heads can play an important role in dissemination of ideas of diversity of religion, ideas, etc. which can help in spreading peace among different communities.</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s28"> </span><span class="s29">The government should not ban minority practices in order to appease the majority group.</span></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: left;">E.g. the state should not show a preference for vegetarianism.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">♤  <span class="s28"> </span><span class="s29">Uniform Civil Code should be formulated and implemented with the consensus of all religious communities so that there is uniformity in personal laws.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="p">Media, movies and other influential should be used in promoting religious harmony and peace.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part81.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part83.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
