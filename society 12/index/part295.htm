Literacy composition </p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Literacy as a prerequisite to education is an instrument of empowerment. The more literate the population the greater the consciousness of career options, as well as participation in the knowledge economy. Further, literacy can lead to health awareness and fuller participation in the cultural and economic well-being of the community. Literacy levels have improved considerably after independence and almost two-thirds of our population is now literate. But,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">literacy rate has struggled to keep pace with the rate of growth of the Indian population It varies considerably across gender, across regions, and across social groups. As can be seen, female literacy has been rising faster than male literacy, partly because it started from relatively low levels. Literacy rates also vary across different social groups – historically disadvantaged communities like the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have lower rates of literacy, and rates of female literacy within these groups are even lower. Regional variations are still very wide, with states like Kerala approaching universal literacy, while states like Bihar are lagging far behind. The inequalities in the literacy rate are especially important because they tend to reproduce inequality across generations. Illiterate parents are at a severe disadvantage in ensuring that their children are well educated, thus perpetuating existing inequalities.
