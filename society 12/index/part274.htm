They are, therefore, denied the opportunity to explore other avenues for self-expression and self-development. This could lead to frustration. Excessive child-bearing affects their own health and that of their children. Looking after a large number of children puts a further strain on the slender physical and emotional resources of such women.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The burden of providing for a large family sits heavily on the bread-winner of the family. The constant struggle to maintain a subsistence level is exhausting. To escape from the problems of everyday life, he may take to drinking. This would lead to further deterioration of the economic and emotional well-being of the family.</p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The children, often unwanted, unloved and neglected, are left to their own to make life bearable. The children in large families often have to start working at a very early age to supplement the slender financial resources of the family. They even indulge in delinquency and are, therefore, denied the opportunity to go to school and get educated.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The girl child is the worst sufferer in these circumstances. She is often not sent to school at all, or is withdrawn from school at an early age to help her mother in carrying out domestic chores and to look after her younger siblings when the mother is at work. Early marriage pushes her into child-bearing, and the vicious cycle continues. The children, both boys and girls, in a large family are thus often denied the joys of childhood, and are pushed into adult roles at a very early age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_116.png"/></span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 159pt;text-indent: 0pt;  text-align: center;">FERTILITY RATE IN INDIA</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As per Sample Registration System TFR in 2011 and 2012 was 2.4 and has declined to <b>2.3 </b>in 2013. 24 States and UTs having already achieved the replacement level of fertility of 2.1.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is to be noted that no targets were set under MDG for Total Fertility Rate (TFR).</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part273.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part275.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
