However, this hierarchical nature of social order violates the trinity of liberty, equality and dignity enshrined in constitution and recognised in Ambedkar&#39;s words &quot;one man one vote and one vote one value&quot;.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In Post-independence India, under the twin influence of affirmative polices for sc/st&#39;s in legislature, government jobs and education along with the democratizing influence of universal adult franchise, it was expected to correct for historical injustices and give effect to the redistributive agenda of the state and thereby weakening the hierarchical foundation of caste on the social life of individuals</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The democratizing influence of universal adult franchise led to the rise of dominant castes in the agriculturally prosperous belts of north India which was followed by their capture of state power. It meant that some caste groups irrespective of their position in the caste hierarchy were able to wield influence and gain prominence and social recognition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_015.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It was further followed by the rise of backward class movement in 1980&#39;s and 90&#39;s which gave rise to caste groups backed regional political parties like BSP, SP etc. in north India. These parties on the other hand were able to become vehicles of social mobilization and registering their presence in wielding power in the state.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The mandalization of politics in India post 1990 has belied the expectation of social scientists that the developmental agenda of the state will wipe out primitive social institutions like caste, whereas other&#39;s like M.N Srinivas have argued that under the aegis of a democratic state the vertical hierarchical nature of caste based social groups has been replaced by a horizontal arrangement of competing caste groups free from any stigma of purity and pollution and this has been termed as the modern avatar of caste.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, recent studies have pointed out that the benefit of affirmative state policies have been cornered often by the dominant groups within the OBC and SC categories, which are a manifestation of the unfulfilled promises of democratic institution.</p> <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This elite capture and the introduction of class element within caste which can be seen in the need felt in recent years to create subcategories as in within the preexisting backward caste and communities. has led to the fracturing of dalit identity into categories like &#39;maha dalits&#39; or &#39;ati dalits&#39;.and backward class and extremely backward class in Bihar.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Also it has also been lamented that rather than weakening caste consciousness democracy has strengthened it and this has been seen by some as impeding the aim of promoting fraternity between the subjects of the state.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Perhaps this examples support the thesis that democratic institution in India though have succeeded in imparting some changes in the caste structure but it were limited to partial redistributive outcomes as far as backward caste categories has concerned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part39.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part41.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
