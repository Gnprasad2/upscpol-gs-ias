Factors that threaten India’s unity</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Regionalism: </span><span class="p">Regionalism tends to highlight interests of a particular region/regions over national interests. It can also adversely impact national integration. Law and order situation is hampered due to regional demands and ensuing agitation.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Divisive politics: </span><span class="p">Sometimes, ascriptive identities such as caste, religion etc. are evoked by politicians in order to garner votes. This type of divisive politics can result in violence, feeling of mistrust and suspicion among minorities.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Development imbalance: </span><span class="p">Uneven pattern of socio-economic development, inadequate economic policies and consequent economic disparities can lead to backwardness of a region. Consequently, this can result in violence, kickstart waves of migration and even accelerate demands of separatism.. For instance, due to economic backwardness of the North East region, several instances of separatist demands and secessionist tendencies have sprung up in the region.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Ethnic differentiation and nativism: </span><span class="p">Ethnic differentiation has often led to clashes between different ethnic groups especially due to factors such as job competition, limited resources,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">threat to identity etc. E.g. frequent clashes between Bodos and Bengali speaking Muslims in Assam. This has been accentuated by son of the soil doctrine, which ties people to their place of birth and confers some benefits, rights, roles and responsibilities on them, which may not apply to others.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Geographical isolation: </span><span class="p">Geographical isolation too can lead to identity issues  and separatist demands. The North-East is geographically isolated from the rest of the country as it is connected with the rest of the country by a narrow corridor i.e the Siliguri corridor (Chicken’s neck). The region has inadequate infrastructure, is more backward economically as compared to the rest of the country. As a result, ithas witnessed several instances of separatism and cross-border terrorism, among others.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_012.png"/></span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Inter-religious conflicts: </span><span class="p">Inter-religious conflicts not only hamper relations between two communities by spreading fear and mistrust but also hinder the secular fabric of the country.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Inter-state conflicts: </span><span class="p">This can lead emergence of feelings related to regionalism. It can also affect trade and communications between conflicting states. For instance, Cauvery river dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">♤  <span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Influence of external factors: </span><span class="p">Sometimes external factors such as foreign organizations terrorist groups, extremist groups can incite violence and sow feelings of separatism. E.g. Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has been accused of supporting and training mujahideen to fight in Jammu and Kashmir and sow separatist tendencies among resident groups.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In-spite of the challenges posed by diversity, there can be no doubt on the role played by socio- cultural diversity in sustaining and developing Indian society.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part31.htm">Problem is not of diversity per se, but the handling of diversity in India society.
