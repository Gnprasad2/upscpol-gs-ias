Current issues regarding communalism</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Currently, manifestation of communalism in India can be witnessed in several forms. These include<b>:</b></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s7"> </span>Hadiya case: <span class="p">A 24 year old Hindu woman, Akhila, who converted to Islam and took a new name, Hadiya was at the centre of the ‘love jihad’ controversy. While she alleged that she converted to Islam and chose to marry her husband out of choice, her father filed a Habeas Corpus petition and claimed that she was forced to convert to Islam and was targeted as a recruit of ISIS. The Kerala High Court annulled her marriage, sent her to her parents’ home and observed that “she was a weak and vulnerable girl capable of being exploited.” However, the Supreme Court protected her freedom to choose her religion and freedom of movement and asked her to return to college to continue her studies</span>.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Beef consumption and ensuing deaths: </span><span class="p">The issue of beef consumption and transportation has been a contentious issue in India and has triggered communal outbreaks in various parts of the country. </span><span class="s23">Muslims were the target of 51% of violence centred on bovine issues over nearly eight years (2010 to 2017) and comprised 86% of 28 Indians killed in 63 incidents, according to an IndiaSpend content analysis.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Ghar Wapsi programmes: </span><span class="p">It is a series of religious conversion activities, facilitated by Indian Hindu organizations such as the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), to facilitate conversion of non-Hindus to Hinduism. While the organizing groups claimed that people voluntarily came forward to convert to Hinduism, some participants claimed that they were forced to do so.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Religious fundamentalism among youth: </span><span class="p">It has been deemed as a major challenge among the youth. There is on-going threat of radicalization among Kashmiri youth, which can give an impetus to already existing separatist tendencies. Further, the youth have fallen prey to fundamentalist tendencies of terrorist groups like the ISIS as many Indian radicalized youth have joined the group. Minister of Home Affairs estimates that 75 Indians have joined the ISIS. However, the reach of the terrorist organization is spreading in India, especially through the medium of social media.</span></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part80.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part82.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
