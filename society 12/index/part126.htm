Distinctive Features of Indian Secularism</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Indian idea and practice of secularism, though was inspired by its western origins yet, was firmly rooted in India’s own unique socio-historical circumstances- i.e. the remarkable religious diversity in contrast to the mono-religious nature of western societies, the freedom struggle which advocated an equal support &amp; equal respect for all religions, upon the fact that the practice of one’s religion was not seen as antithetical to practice of democracy but as one which would strengthen it in the long run.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Indian  conception of secularism thus recognized  the deeply religious nature of Indian society &amp; infused the principle of equality within the practice of religion. Secularism was turned into an non-negotiable basic feature of constitution &amp; the term itself was reinvented to allow intervention of state into religious matters when it was being done to promote not only inter religious equality ( ie equal rights for all citizens irrespective of their religious preferences, along with added protection for religious minorities) but also intra religious equality ( by ensuring that one sect of a religion does not dominate over other).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The desirability of state intervention into religious matters has been upheld under the Indian conception of secularism to give space to progressive voices within every religion and to allow disagreement with some aspects of religions. For example, the abolition of untouchability, sati, dowry, the amendment of Hindu marriage &amp; inheritance laws &amp; the demand for establishing the uniform civil code etc. can be seen as an application of this concept.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At the same time, the Indian ideal of secularism clearly cautions against allowing religion to interfere in state matters, thereby disallowing mobilizing the electorate on religious lines for winning elections on one hand while strictly spelling out that the Indian nation-state shall have no state religion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_052.png"/></span></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part127.htm">Some Judicial Pronouncements Regarding Secularism in India</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part125.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part127.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
