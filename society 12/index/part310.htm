Problems of Under-Population</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Uneven Distribution of Population: </span><span class="p">Average population densities for under populated countries are low. Small populations increase slowly, even though birth rates are often high.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Immigration is an important source of people but it is usually to the towns and cities rather that rural areas/countryside. At the same time cities with their better living conditions attract people from the already sparsely settled countryside. Imbalance between town and country is a major problem of under populated countries.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Remoteness: </span><span class="p">It is difficult to increase settlement in sparsely populated areas because people are unwilling to forego the amenities of the town. Where there are few people it is uneconomic to provide elaborate communications, health, education or other facilities. This in turn increases the unwillingness of people to settle in such areas.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'  src="Image_140.png"/></span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Under Utilization of resources: </span><span class="p">Lack of population makes it difficult for a country to develop its resources to  the full. Minerals will usually be extracted, especially precious metals and petroleum, because the desire for wealth will overcome other considerations. Agricultural resources are more difficult to develop because they require more and harder work over a long period of years before they show a good return.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Slow growth of Industry: </span><span class="p">This is due to shortage of labour, especially skilled labour in under populated countries, e.g. in the South American and African countries. Imported skilled labour raises the cost of industrial development. Moreover the small population does not provide an adequate market even where the standard of living is high.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">⧫<span class="s7"> </span><span class="s5">Climatic Problems: </span><span class="p">Hostile climate or relief conditions make settlement difficult. Such conditions obstruct development and are likely never to be fully overcome.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In under populated  countries needs to  be increased  but this will only work if  immigrants possess the right skills and are prepared to live in sparsely populated areas. In the 19th century, when the USA was settled people were prepared to develop the land because many of them were landless peasants, but immigrants to under populated countries today generally prefer town life. To open up under populated areas is both difficult and expensive and require huge capital investments.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part309.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part311.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
