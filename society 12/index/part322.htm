NPP-2000: The Way Forward</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">NPP-2000 cannot be solely judged a success or failure on the basis of Fertility rates alone. Total fertility rates ignore the larger mission of NPP-2000, namely the promise of high quality reproductive healthcare. While southern states like Kerala and Andhra Pradesh are successfully prioritizing proper implementation and womenâ€™s health, the vast majority of states continue to compromise reproductive health with poor service.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The solution to poor implementation is clear: state governments and other administrators of NPP-2000 need to prioritize reproductive health at every level of the family planning program.</p> <p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To do so, the family planning program must expand. Large scale networks are a crucial piece of this recommendation. By formalizing the relationships among Panchayats, NGOs, grassroots organizations, and state officials, the family planning program will likely garner greater support and transparency. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should take steps to attract health care workers and doctors to the family planning field. In addition, staff must be properly trained and held accountable for their work. Competitive pay should be offered to family planning professionals so as to maintain high quality services in the long-term.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Further, transportation limitations must be addressed in order to reach men and women of disadvantaged populations (i.e. slum residents, tribal castes, and rural residents). Finally, men must be included in discussions of family planning practice. Ample evidence suggests that husbands make decisions related to family planning and healthcare, yet data from the most recent Demographic and  Health  Survey (2005) reveal that men  are less knowledgeable of contraceptive methods than their female partners. Collaborative family planning decisions made by men and women are likely to yield fertility outcomes which satisfy both partners. Thus, administrators of the National Population Policy (2000) should take steps to educate men about the benefits of family planning.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What families lack is education, information, and adequate access to contraceptives. If the National Population Policy (2000) is to eliminate the unmet contraceptive needs of all Indians, implementation of the family planning program must reflect an appreciation of family preferences and high quality healthcare.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part323.htm">What else should a future population policy address?</a><a class="toc0" href="part324.htm">On-going interventions</a><a class="toc0" href="part325.htm">New Interventions under Family Planning Programme</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part321.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part323.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
