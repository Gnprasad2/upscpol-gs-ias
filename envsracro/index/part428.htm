One of the biggest concerns with the environmental clearance process is related to the quality of EIA report that are being carried out. The reports are generally incomplete and provided with false data.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">2. EIA reports ignore several aspects while carrying out assessments and significant information is found to omitted.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">3. Many EIA report are based on single season data and are not adequate to determine whether environmental clearance should be granted. All this makes the entire exercise contrary to its very intent.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">4. As things stand today, it is the responsibility of the project proponent to commission the preparation of the EIA for its project. The EIA is actually funded by an agency or individual whose primary interest is to procure clearance for the project proposed. There is little chance that the final assessment presented is un biased, even if the consultant may provide an unbiased assessment that is critical of the proposed project. Some times it is found that a consultancy which is working in the project area has no specialization in the concerned subject. For example for the preparation of EIA report of the proposed oil exploration in coast of Orissa by the reliance group has been given to the life science Dept of Berhampur university which has no expertise on the study of turtles and its life cycle.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">5. The EIA document in itself is so bulky and technical, which makes it very difficult to decipher so as to aid in the decision making process.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">6. There are so many cases of fraudulent EIA studies where erroneous data has been used, same facts used for two totally different places etc. This is due to the lack of a centralized baseline data bank, where such data can be crosschecked.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">7. There is no accreditation of EIA consultants, therefore any such consultant with a track record of fraudulent cases cannot be held liable for discrepancies. It is hard to imagine any consultant after being paid lakh of rupees, preparing a report for the project proponents, indicating that the project is not viable.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">8. In nearly every case, the consultants try to interpret and tailor the information looking for ways and means to provide their clients with a report that gives them their moneys worth.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monitoring, compliance and institutional arrangements:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p>  <p  style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do you know? </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">India has also set up a National Adaptation Fund with an initial allocation of INR 3,500 million (USD 55.6 million) to combat the adaptation needs in key sectors. This fund will assist national and state level activities to meet the cost of adaptation measures in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">1. Often, and more so for strategic industries such as nuclear energy projected, the EMPs are kept confidential for political and administrative reasons</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. Details regarding the effectiveness and implementation of mitigation measures are often not provided.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">3. Emergency preparedness plans are not discussed in sufficient details and the information not disseminated to the communities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part427.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part429.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
