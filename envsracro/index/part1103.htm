These species are chosen for their vulnerability, attractiveness or distinctiveness in order to engender support and acknowledgement from the public at large. Thus, the concept of a flagship species holds that, by giving publicity to a few key species, the support given to those species will successfully leverage conservation of entire ecosystems are all species contained therein.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <span class="p">Example: Indian tiger, African elephant, giant panda of China, mountain gorilla of Central Africa, orangutan of Southeast Asia and the leatherback sea turtle.</span></p>  <p  style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keystone species </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <span class="p">Keystone species is a species whose addition to or loss from an ecosystem leads to major changes in abundance or occurrence of at least one other species.

Hence top predators are given much consideration in conservation.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <span class="p">Key stone species deserves special attention from the conservation point of view. Conservation of keystone species encourages conservation of all other relevant species associated with this.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <span class="p">If keystone species is lost, it will result in the degradation of whole ecosystem. For example certain plant species (ebony tree, Indian-laurel) exclusively depends upon bats for its pollination. If the bat population is reduced then regeneration of particular plants becomes more difficult. This changes the vegetation structure which adversely influence on the dependant animals.</span></p>  <p  style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Indicator species </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <span class="p">Indicator species is a species whose presence indicates the presence of a set of other species and whose absence indicates the lack of that entire set of species.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <span class="p">An indicator species is any biological species that defines a trait or characteristic of the environment. For example, a species may delineate an ecoregion or indicate an environmental condition such as a disease outbreak, pollution, species competition or climate change. Indicator species can be among the most</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sensitive species in a region, and sometimes act as an early warning to monitoring biologists.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <span class="p">Many indicator species of the ocean systems are fish, invertebrates, periphyton, macrophytes and specific species of ocean birds (like the Atlantic Puffin).

The protection of umbrella species automatically extends protection to other species. These are species selected for making conservation related decisions, typically because protecting these species indirectly protects the many other species that make up the ecological community of its habitat.</span></p>  <p  style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GLOSSARY </p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <b>Warm-blooded </b><span class="p">is a term to describe animal species which have a relatively higher blood temperature, and maintain thermal homeostasis primarily through internal metabolic processes.

It takes place during times of heat and dryness, the hot dry season, which is often but not necessarily the summer months. Invertebrate and vertebrate animals are known to enter this state to avoid damage from high temperatures and the risk of desiccation. Both terrestrial and aquatic animals undergo aestivation.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <b>Hibernation </b><span class="p">is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression in animals, characterized by lower body temperature, slower breathing, and lower metabolic rate. Hibernating animals conserve food, especially during winter when food supplies are limited, tapping energy reserves, body fat, at a slow rate. It is the animal’s slowed metabolic rate which leads to a reduction in body temperature and not the other way around.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">♤    <b>Reforestation </b><span class="p">Is the restocking of existing forests and woodlands which have been depleted</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">♤    <b>Afforestation </b><span class="p">is the establishment of a forest or stand of trees in an area where there was no forest</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">♤    <b>Deforestation </b><span class="p">Is the removal of a forest or stand of trees where the land is thereafter converted to a non</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">forest use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <b>Forest cover </b><span class="p">is the presence of trees on lands more than one hectare in area with a tree canopy of more than 10 percent, irrespective of ownership and legal status.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <b>Tree cover </b><span class="p">comprises the tree patches outside forest area and exclusive of forest cover that has less than a minimum map-able area of one hectare.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">♤    <b>Agroforestry </b><span class="p">Is an integrated approach of using the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops and livestock.
