Ports not only play a crucial role in facilitating international trade, they also act as fulcrums of economic activity and development in their surrounding areas. India has about 7517 km of main coastline spread over 13 states/union territories, and studded with 12 major ports and 200 non major ports (minor and intermediate). Of the nonmajorports, around 60 are handling traf fic. The major ports are under the jurisdiction of the Central Government, while the minor and intermediate ports are managed and maintained by the respective state governments. The number of cargo vessels handled at major port is about 16,500 per annum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">The total traffic carried by both the major and minor ports during 2005-06 was estimated at around 570 million tonnes. The 12 major ports carry about 75 per cent of the total traffic with Vishakhapatnam as the top traffic handler in each of the last .six years (2000-01 to 2006-07). <b>Major Seaports of India </b>The major seaports of India are: (i) Chennai, (ii) Cochin, (iii) Ennore, (iv) Jawaharlal Nehru Port (Nhava Sheva), (v) Kandla, (vi) Kolkata/ Haldia, (vii) Mormugao, (viii) Mumbai, (ix) New Mangalore, (x) Paradwip, (xi) New Tuticorin, and (xii) Vishakhapatnam <b>(Fig. 12.6).

The indigenous Aircraft Carrier for the Indian Navy is also presently under construction in the shipyard. It remains open for cargo traffic throughout the year. Being situated close to the Suez-Colombo route, it has great commercial and strategic importance. The main items of export mode of transportation in Indian transport network. It is a crucial component for the development of domestic industry and trade. Coastal shipping involves movement of goods and passengers from one port to another port within the country. India’s coastal Shipping Tonnage in December 2005 was 470 vessels with 8,04,612 GRT.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Coastal shipping has many advantages as given below:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1. It reduces the pressure on rail and road transport systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. It is relatively pollution free.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. It is less capital intensive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. It provides large employment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5. It is the cheapest mode of transport.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6, It promotes coastal base industries such as fisheries and corals collection.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7.

Indian ports are the most congested.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. The ports are not adequately connected with the hinterland.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">3. There is heavy pressure on container traffic. The largest container port in the world is Singapore which handles 23.19 million TEUs (twenty foot equivalent units). In comparison to this India’s largest container port handled roughly 2.67 million TEUs in 2005-06.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img class="responsive-img"  width="95%" height="auto"   src="Image_201.gif"  alt=" " onerror='this.style.display="none"'/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fig. 12.7 <span class="s3">Major Fishing Ports</span></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">India has about 14,500 km of navigable waterways which comprise rivers, canals, lakes, backwaters, and creeks. About 45 million tonnes of cargo is being moved annually by Inland Water Transport. It is a fuel-efficient and environment-friendly mode of transportation. Its operations are currently restricted to a few stretches in the Ganga-Hugli rivers, the Brahmaputra, the Barak river (Assam), the rivers in Goa, the backwaters of Kerala, inland waterways in Mumbai, and the deltaic regions of the Godavari-Krishna rivers. Besides the organised operations by mechanised vessels, country boats of various capacities also operate in various rivers, lakes, and canals. Data of cargo and passengermovement in unorganised sector (i.e., by country boats, etc.) has not been compiled, but it is a fact that substantial quantum of cargo and passengers are transported in the unorganised sector as well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: justify;">The Central Waler Transport Corporation (CIWTC) <span class="p">Constituted in 1967, it has its headquarters at Kolkata. It is mainly engaged in the transportation of goods by inland waterways in the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Hugli, and Sundarban regions. It is operating regular cargo service between Kolkata and Karimganj (Assam), Kolkata and Bangladesh, and Haldia and Patna.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) <span class="p">The Inland Waterways Authority of India came into existence on October 27, 1986 for the development and regulation of inland waterways for shipping and navigation. The Authority primarily undertakes projects for development and maintenance of IWT infrastructure on national waterways through grant received from the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. The head-office of the Authority is located at NOIDA (UP near Delhi). The authority also has its regional offices at Guwahati, Kochi, Kolkata, and Patna and sub-offices at Allahabad, Bhagalpur, Farakka, Kollam, and Varanasi. The National Inland Navigation Institute is located at Patna.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">National Waterways <span class="p">Following are National Waterways in India:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.

Fluctuation Regime of Riven <span class="p">Many of the rivers are seasonal. Even in the perennial rivers, like Brahmaputra, Ganga, Gandak, Kosi, and Yamuna, the discharge of water decreases substantially during the summer and winter months, while during the rainy season they are in floods. Both the conditions are not conducive for navigation.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2. <span class="s2">Natural Obstacles </span><span class="p">Presence of waterfalls, cataracts, and rapids in the course of rivers hinder the development of inland navigation.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3. Silting of River Beds <span class="p">Silting of river bed reduces the depth of water and creates problems of navigation.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4. Water for Irrigation <span class="p">Diversion of water for irrigation reduces the quantity of water in the river channel.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">5. Economically Unviablc <span class="p">The demand for waterways is not adequate as the people want fast movement of their commodities. This makes river transport economically unviable.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Managing about 95% of the country’s trade volume is carried by shipping (2012). India has a long history of shipping. The Scindhia Steam Navigation Co. was set up in 1919 on modern lines. At the time of Independence, there were only 59 ships with less than 2 lakh tonnes of Gross Registered Tonnage (GRT). Since Independence, India has made a significant progress in shipping and the shipping fleet had 872 ships (282 overseas and 590 coastal vessels (India 2010)). Coal, crude oil and natural gas are mainly transported by ship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">At present, shipping plays a significant role in the transport sector of the country’s economy. Nearly 95 per cent of the total trade volume is moved by sea m<u>aking</u> shipping the backbone of trade and economic growth. Today India has one of the largest merchant shipping fleet in the developing world.

The possibility of formation of shoals in the shallow continental shelf as barrier bars (sandbars) appear to be the most plausible explanation for the evolution ol Rameswaram and Adam’s Bridge.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Thus all the scientific studies about the Ram Sethu suggest a consistent picture of natural process that led to the formation of Adam’s Bridge.
