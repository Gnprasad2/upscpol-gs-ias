The western slope of Sahyadri is steep while the eastern slope is gentle. These are block mountains formed due to the downwarping of a part of land into the Arabian Sea. The Sahyadris form a watershed of the peninsula. All the important rivers of Peninsular India, like the Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri rise from the Western Ghats. The western rivers merging into the Arabian Sea are swift. The Gersoppa (Jog Falls) on Sharvati is the highest waterfall in India. The average elevation of the Western Ghats varies between 1000 to 1300 metres (Fig. 2.3).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">The important peaks of the Western Ghats are Kudermukh (1892 m), Pushpagiri (1714 m), Kalsubai (1646 m) and Sallier (1567 m), Mahabaleshwar (1438 m) and Harishchandra (1424 m).
