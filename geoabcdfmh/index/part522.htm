Because of these factors, the development of hydro-power is not uniform. Andhra Pradesh ranks first, followed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. The major Hydro-electric Power Plants have been given in <b>Table 8.9.</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">After Independence, especially in the First Five Year Plan, great emphasis was laid on the development of electricity. To achieve this objective, a number of multipurpose projects were installed. Some of the important multipurpose projects have been described in the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table 8.9 <span class="s8">State-wise Main Hydro-Electric Power Plants</span></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="search-table-outter wrapper">
