It was reached through the arbitration of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Developemnt which has set up a permanent Indus Commission to look after disagreement arising between India and Pakistan. Under this agreement, India has been given exclusive rights to use the waters of the three eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Satluj), leaving out the remaining three (Chenab,Jhelum, and Indus) to Pakistan, which will also take into account the water needs of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The agreement between India and Pakistan of the Salal, Baghliar and Dulhasti projects (Chcnab River) are an excellent example of co-operation between the two countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Similarly, a thirty-year agreement was also reached between India and Bangladesh on December 12, 1996, for the sharing of Ganga waters. Under the agreement, India and Bangladesh would share alternately for 10 days each, 35,000 cusecs of water during the lean season (1<span class="s6">st </span>March to 10<span class="s6">th </span>May) to fulfill their water needs. A similar agreement has been concluded between India and Nepal for sharing river waters. Moreover, India is helping Nepal in executing many river valley projects. The Mahakali Project is the outcome of one such Indo-Nepal joint ventures. Mutual agreement has also been reached between India and Bhutan for harnessing the waters of the international rivers affecting these countries. The king of Bhutan has agreed to join a sub-regional plan for sharing river waters and power with India and Bangladesh. Bhutan is willing to divert 12,000 cusecs of water from the Sankosh River to Tista and from Tista to Farakka Barrage to be shared by India and Bangladesh. The plan also envisages India purchasing 4000 megawatt of hydel power from Bhutan to strengthen its National Power Grid and to meet the power needs of the north eastern region.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part232.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part234.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
