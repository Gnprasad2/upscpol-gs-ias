Thus, the monsoon is not a continual deluge of a number of months, duration, but has inter-seasonal variability; being made of a series of discrete events, both pluvial and dry. Viewed locally, these are the active and break monsoons respectively which exist on a time scale ranging from a few days to few weeks. Thus, while the monsoon appears to have a well-defined annual cycle, closer examination shows that the monsoon has substantial variability which becomes evident as the intensity of monsoon rains wax and wane through the wet season. Periods during which there is a rapid succession of weather disturbances or storms lasting a few days are referred to as <i>active periods </i>of the monsoon. Periods during which there is no rainfall for few days are the <i>break periods </i>of the monsoon. During an active phase, the Tropical Easterlyjet Stream (TEJ) remains very strong in the upper troposphere indicating strong convection and latent heating. But, when the maximum cloudiness remains locked up in the foothills of the Himalayas and the monsoon rainfall zone moves in this direction, subsidence occurs to produce a weak easterly flow in the upper troposphere. This creates the condition of break in monsoons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">In break monsoon condition, there is a general rise of pressure (as well as temperature) over the country and the isobars show marked refraction along the west coast. Cloudiness decreases and the south-easterlies at the surface levels over northern India are replaced by hot westerly air which blows over the plains, since the broad-scale surface pressure (the monsoon trough) shifts to the Himalayas and the rainfall practically ceases over the country outside the Himalayan regions and the southern slopes of the Himalayas, leading to high floods in the plains of these Himalayan rivers. Thus, though there is no rain over the plains, all the major northern and eastern Indian rivers rise and floods ensue.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">Under weak monsoon conditions and in the years when the eastern end of the axis of the monsoon trough is oriented southward in Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, a low valley trough develops over the Assam Plain aligned along river Brahmaputra between the eastern Himalayas and the Shillong Plateau. The vertical extent of this low valley trough is 2 to 3 kilometres with the south west Monsoon lying to the south of the trough, remaining independent of the main monsoon trough. But, when the latter moves northwards and extends to the Himalayas, it joins the trough over the Assam Plain to cause heavy rainfall there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;    text-align: left;">The break in monsoon conditions generally occurs in the peak months ofjuly and August, and lasts for at least 3 to 5 days over 500 to 1000 kilometres length in these months. The breaks occur on two time scales, usually from 10 to 20 days which on some occasions gets locked to a 40 to 50 daysâ€™ break configuration.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;     text-align: left;">Depending upon their timing and duration, the break monsoon conditions are the harbingers of regional droughts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp; </p></div><p class="nav"><a href="part283.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part285.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="google_translate_element"></div><script src="index.js"></script>
